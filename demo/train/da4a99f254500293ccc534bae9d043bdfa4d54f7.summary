@entity0 -- it was a bellwether election of sorts			0
gun - control democrats in @entity5 running for governor , lieutenant governor and attorney general all won despite poor reviews from the @entity10 , a politically powerful organization headquartered in the state			1
" i do n't care what grade i got from the @entity10 , " @entity12 said in the gubernatorial campaign 's final debate			0
he received an " f " from the group , which is holding its annual conference in @entity18 starting on friday			0
gun - control advocates cheered when the three @entity21 prevailed			1
the gun - rights lobby soldiered on			1
although @entity12 's first effort at tougher gun laws in @entity5 was thwarted in the legislature not long after he took office , it illustrated where the battles are being fought now that the issue has effectively moved from @entity0 , where the @entity31 a year ago failed to advance new measures following the horrendous @entity34 school massacre in @entity35			1
battlegrounds in the states gun - control and gun - rights forces are now squaring off in the states and their efforts are funded by backers who are pouring millions into the fray			1
" it 's mixed in many ways , " economist and pro-gun advocate @entity44 , president of the @entity46 , said of the nation 's newest slate of gun laws			0
" obviously , there 's some states that have been pushing for more gun control and others are moving in the other direction			1
" according to an analysis conducted for @entity1 by the @entity59 , states have enacted more than 40 new gun laws since the start of the year			1
roughly half are those considered by such gun - control groups as the @entity65 as having " minimal impact " on existing law			1
they include provisions in a measure passed by the @entity73 - controlled @entity72 legislature allowing people , under certain circumstances , to renew their concealed handgun permits in a county different from the one in which the gun was originally registered			1
gun - law reform in @entity72 also was a closely - watched topic when tough new restrictions on expanded background checks on private sales and limits on ammunition magazines were signed into law			1
several @entity21 state lawmakers were recalled over their votes			0
guns and mental health the crop of state laws also includes measures that touch on issues debated passionately on the national scene			1
the @entity98 - controlled @entity97 state legislature passed a measure requiring that mental health records of " someone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity " be sent to the @entity105			1
statistics from the @entity107 's @entity105 ( @entity105 ) show about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check over the past 14 years , or 10,180 people , were turned down for reasons related to mental health			1
questions of mental health and gun ownership again made headlines this month when a soldier opened fire at @entity119 , @entity120 , killing three and wounding more than a dozen others before taking his own life			1
authorities say spc. @entity124 was an iraq war veteran under evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder			0
it 's not clear if the second shooting of its kind on the sprawling military base will lead to changes in law			1
this week , @entity135 gov. @entity134 signed legislation -- known by critics as the " guns everywhere bill " -- that allows residents who have concealed carry permits to take guns into some bars , churches , school zones , government buildings and certain parts of airports			2
new money , old fight shifts in direction are due in part to the influence of big money and organization			0
" for many years , the gun lobby has had an advantage both in terms of funding and a well - organized and committed grassroots which it has used to hold back efforts to strengthen gun laws that are supported by the vast majority of @entity168 , including the vast majority of gun owners , " said @entity158 , director of the @entity159			2
" for years , politicians felt that there was more to lose than to gain by supporting much - needed reforms to keep guns from dangerous people			2
" this month , former @entity177 mayor @entity176 pledged $ 50 million to try to combat what he and other gun - control advocates see as the @entity10 's outsized political influence			2
@entity10 gathers as gun debate cools , shifts focus his new group , @entity184 for @entity185 â € ” an umbrella organization for his other groups : @entity188 and @entity189 â € ” plans to borrow from the @entity10 playbook			0
@entity192 's group hopes to build strong grassroots support , motivate membership and lobby effectively			0
but gun - control advocates say the playing field wo n't even out overnight			2
" i think that at the federal level , it 's going to take time , " said @entity197 , executive director of the @entity65			0
" the @entity10 and their allies have spent time entrenching themselves in @entity0 and it 's going to take our national leaders time to recognize there are other players now			0
" for its part , the @entity10 says it is not backing down			0
" the fight continues , " said @entity10 spokesman @entity210			0
" it 's not something that is over as the gun - control lobby and @entity176 have shown they lie in wait for the next tragedy to occur to try and push their agenda			2
" quietly studying the issue quietly , the @entity221 is preparing to fund gun violence prevention studies in some cases for the first time in nearly two decades			1
the effort , critics say , amounts to a politically - motivated use of taxpayer funds			0
" we 're seeing that money abused to promote politics and a gun - control agenda , " @entity210 said			2
the @entity233 previously announced it would award grants this fall			0
" @entity233 has and will continue to fund research to inform prevention programs related to firearm violence , " agency spokeswoman @entity235 said			2
" studies designed to develop and evaluate firearm injury prevention activities are part of larger efforts to develop more effective public health education programs			0
" this includes research about parental roles in preventing injury - including injuries from firearms - in the home and in other settings			2
@entity233 also supports research to understand the relationship between alcohol abuse and gun violence , as part of broader efforts to develop more effective interventions to help prevent violence , " @entity251 said			1
separately , republicans on the @entity258 have vowed to block president @entity260 's proposal to try to secure $ 10 million in federal funding to scientifically study gun violence through the @entity263			1
the agency has not received money to study the topic since the mid- 1990s after the @entity10 lobbied to nix that type of funding following the agency 's controversial study that found gun owners ' homes had higher homicide rates			0
@entity1 's @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report			0
