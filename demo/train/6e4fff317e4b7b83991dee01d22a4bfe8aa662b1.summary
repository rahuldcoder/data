-- packed tight into wire baskets -- sometimes 20 or more to a cage -- animal rights activists say as many as 200,000 live dogs every year are smuggled from northeast @entity5 across the @entity6 destined for restaurants in @entity8			1
dehydrated , stressed , some even dying of suffocation on the trip , the dogs are often stacked 1,000 to a truck on a journey that lasts for days			0
" obviously when you 've got dogs stacked on top of each other they start biting each other because they are so uncomfortable , any kind of movement then the dog next to the one that 's being crushed is going to bite back , " said @entity15 , director of @entity8 , a @entity17 - based animal welfare group			1
when they arrive in @entity8 , the suffering does n't end there			1
a common belief is that stress and fear releases hormones that improve the taste of the meat , so the dogs are placed in stress cages that restrict their movement			0
eventually , the dogs are either bludgeoned to death or have their throats cut in front of other dogs who are awaiting the same fate			0
in some cases , they 've been known to be skinned alive			0
" dogs are highly intelligent animals so if you kill a dog and you have a whole cage of dogs next to the one that 's being killed , those dogs that are going to be killed next know what 's going on , " @entity15 said			2
according to animal rights groups , dog smugglers round up everything from family pets to @entity5 's ubiquitous strays -- known as soi dogs -- to sell the animals in @entity8 , or even as far away as @entity67 where a pedigree dog can fetch a premium price			1
@entity70 of the @entity72 - based @entity71 estimates 98 % of the dogs are domesticated and that some are even still wearing collars and have been trained and respond to commands			0
" you can see all types of pedigree animals in these captured @entity5 shipments -- golden retrievers , long - haired terriers , you name it , " says @entity70			1
others are snatched from streets , temples , and even people 's gardens			0
" in the past , batches of stray dogs were traded for plastic buckets , but these days with demand soaring -- especially in the winter months when dog meat is regarded as a " warming " food -- a dog in @entity5 can fetch up to $ 10			1
this figure jumps to around $ 60 once they are served up in restaurants in @entity8			1
@entity70 says pet dogs , in particular , are targeted because they are friendlier and easier to catch			0
animal rights activists estimate that more than one million dogs are eaten each year in @entity8 ; for the dog smugglers of the @entity6 , business is booming			1
while the trade is illegal in @entity5 , and authorities have made a number of raids involving thousands of dogs , dog traders claim the laws are unclear and have even mounted counter protests against a series of crackdowns			1
smugglers are normally prosecuted under laws that prohibit the illegal trade and transportation of animals and , with no direct animal cruelty laws in @entity5 , prosecutors attempt to charge smugglers with cruelty under @entity125 laws			1
the @entity71 and the @entity126 are fighting to change that and are currently working through the @entity128 to get an @entity129 through the @entity5 @entity130			2
the reality , however , is that smugglers often receive light sentences of just a few months in jail			0
animal activists also say thousands of impounded dogs -- rescued from smugglers -- that end up in quarantine centers sometimes find their way back onto the streets and in the dog meat circle again			2
" this is not about whether it is right or wrong to eat dog meat , " @entity70 says			2
" it is about an illegal trade worth millions of dollars per year organized by criminals			2
the way in which these dogs are transported and , if they survive , killed , is horrific			0
" some of the footage we receive is so horrific it 's too strong even for the media to run			0
it 's so inhumane ... it 's quite literally hell on earth			0

dog smuggling is booming in @entity5 around the @entity6 border region with @entity162
@entity5 authorities say the trade has been growing thanks to a strong *market* in @entity8
animal welfare groups say operators often pick up strays off the street *including* pets
a dog in @entity5 can fetch up to $ 10 but sells for $ 60 in restaurants in @entity8
