@entity1 , @entity0 -- as an organization they 're used to investing billions of dollars in scientific experiments that further our knowledge of earth and space			0
but the only bill to speak of on this occasion is orange and attached to the body of a rubber duck			0
scientists from @entity15 hope that rubber ducks will help them better understand glacier movements			1
in the name of climate change science , researchers at @entity15 have dropped 90 rubber ducks into holes of @entity24 's fastest moving glacier : the @entity25 in @entity26			1
scientists remain unsure as to why glaciers speed up their movement in the summer months and it is hoped that the rubber ducks -- labeled with the words " science experiment " and " reward " in three languages , along with an email address -- will shed some light on the phenomenon			1
one theory is that the summer sun melts ice on the surface of the glacier which creates pools of water which then flow into moulins -- narrow tubular shafts in the glacier			1
these then transport the water from the top to the underside of the glacier			0
it 's thought that this base water acts as a lubricant to speed up the movement of the glacier towards the sea			2
it is hoped the ducks will help show how the water moves through the ice			2
in conjunction with the ducks , @entity15 has also launched a @entity65 probe which they hope will tell them more about the inner workings of the glacier			1
so far , neither the probe nor any of the ducks have turned up			0
@entity71 of @entity15 's @entity72 in @entity73 told @entity74 : " we have n't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it			2
" the @entity25 is responsible for seven percent of all ice which is peeling off @entity24 and its ice sheets could contribute to sea levels rising this century			1
the glacier 's menace was also felt last century			0
experts believe that it was the source of the iceberg which sank the @entity89 in 1912			0
it 's not the first time rubber ducks have helped scientists track water flows			1
thousands fell into the sea in 1992 when a container ship bound for @entity97 from @entity98 shed its load in a storm in the @entity101			0
the ducks spent years at sea and washed up in all corners of the globe , telling oceanographers much about the surface currents of the oceans .			0

@entity15 scientists launch a *flotilla* of 90 rubber ducks to *investigate* ice melt in glacier
the @entity25 in @entity26 is the fastest moving glacier in @entity24
researchers *investigating* why glacier movement speeds up during summer months
