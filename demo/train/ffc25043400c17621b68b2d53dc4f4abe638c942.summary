at long last , this @entity1 we celebrate the true dawn of the @entity3			1
that sunrise is hastened , here and abroad , by the slow demise of the once - touted " too - cheap - to - meter " @entity7 of nuclear power			1
as utilities find nuclear power less and less cost effective , new solar photovoltaic installations in the @entity10 are springing up			1
new solar installations in 2013 reached a record 4.2 gigawatts , bringing the total to 10			1
on average , one gigawatt of solar photovoltaics powers 164,000 @entity10 homes			2
that means power for 1.6 million homes			0
@entity22 , in 2013 , solar power installations grew by 38 gigawatts , from 96 to 134			1
according to the @entity25 2013 , in the preceding year , 45 gigawatts of wind and 32 gigawatts of solar power were installed worldwide , compared with a net addition of just 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear			1
hastening this energy revolution is the nuclear industry 's achilles heel : an aging , dangerous reactor fleet that is increasingly uncompetitive and new reactor designs that are too expensive to build			1
last year , utilities permanently shuttered five more reactors , lowering the number of operating units in the @entity10 to fewer than 100 for the first time in two decades			2
utility owners canceled at least nine planned upgrades of existing reactors , deeming the investments no longer economically justifiable			0
additionally , nine planned new nuclear reactors were axed in 2013 , an indication of how rapidly things have changed			1
just five years ago , utilities applied for licenses to construct at least 27 new reactors			0
by the close of 2013 , only four of those reactor projects were still alive			0
opinion : want green cities ? lose the cars ironically , @entity55 , arguably the world 's greatest capitalist , has emerged as the poster child for this dramatic shift			2
in june 2013 , @entity55 's @entity60 utility threw in the towel after a failed three - year legislative battle to require @entity64 electric customers to foot the bill for the design and construction of a prototype small modular reactor			2
mainstream groups like @entity70 vigorously opposed that fiscally imprudent investment			0
earlier , @entity60 canceled another proposed reactor in @entity73 on the grounds it was not worth the money			0
what 's significant about this about - face on nuclear by the highly regarded " @entity55 " is that @entity55 instead decided to install 656 large wind turbines at a cost of $ 1.9 billion in @entity64 , and has gone " all - in " with multibillion dollar bets on utility - scale wind and solar power and other renewable energy facilities throughout the @entity85			1
not just @entity88 wizards are shifting investment outlooks and strategies			0
regulators and industry officials alike exude confidence that this is the era for solar , wind and other green energy technologies			0
in august 2013 , @entity97 , then chairman of the @entity98 , observed that " solar is growing so fast it is going to overtake everything ... it could double every two years			0
" in his annual @entity102 in january , president @entity101 highlighted this auspicious trend by praising solar 's rapid growth , announcing that , " every four minutes , another @entity10 home or business goes solar			1
... " while nuclear has flat - lined in the marketplace , statistics demonstrating solar 's growth actually underestimate the total contribution to our country 's electrical supply from solar			2
this is because nonutility and small - scale -- residential and commercial rooftop -- photovoltaic systems do n't show up as electric generation in the industry 's statistics			0
the utilities that compile generation statistics view rooftop solar electricity , used on site , not as power generation but as a reduction in demand ! if it 's not sold by a utility , it 's not " real " power			2
in fact , one of the authors built a six - story office building in @entity140 that produced more electricity on its roof last year than it used			0
if this can be done in @entity140 , the cloudiest major city in the contiguous 48 states , it can be done anywhere			0
in 2013 , @entity10 , and the world , crossed the threshold to a sustainable , ultimately nonnuclear , carbon - free energy future			1
while much remains to be done and there is a long way to go , this @entity1 is especially meaningful and inspiring for those of us who have spent our careers pursuing this essential goal			0
we can see the clear outline of a sustainable energy future that our children , our economy and our planet can live with .			1

writers : on @entity1 we celebrate the dawn of the @entity3 , *decline* of nuclear power
they say in the @entity10 and worldwide , solar power installations are *proliferating*
writers : nuclear reactors are aging and uncompetitive and it 's too expensive to build new ones
writers : in 2013 , @entity10 and the world on threshold of sustainable , clean energy future
