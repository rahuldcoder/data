@entity0 -- a federal appeals court wednesday issued an order blocking the @entity5 military from enforcing its " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on gays and lesbians serving in the military			1
@entity5 officials have been moving ahead with dismantling the policy but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it at this time			1
at issue in the complex legal fight is whether " do n't ask , do n't tell " can remain in effect -- even in name only -- while the legal fight over its constitutionality is being fought in the federal courts			1
judges have been at odds over the enforcement issue for months			0
the case puts the @entity26 administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal , but at the same time filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned			1
military officials suggest the policy compliance changes eliminating " do n't ask , do n't tell " could be finished in a few weeks			1
in a brief order wednesday , the 9th @entity5 circuit @entity32 echoed that , saying , " the process of repealing ( the policy ) is well underway , and the preponderance of the armed forces are expected to have been trained by mid-summer " on abiding by the new guidelines			2
" the circumstances and balance of hardships have changed , " said the three - judge panel , concluding that as a result , " do n't ask , do n't tell " can not remain in place			1
the @entity46 can now go back to the @entity47 to try and have the enforcement order suspended for a second time			0
the justices last fall upheld an earlier order keeping the policy in place			2
the @entity56 - based appeals court also announced it would hear oral arguments in the issue in late august			1
a gay rights group -- the @entity59 -- had sued over the 18 - year - old ban on openly gay and lesbian members from service in the @entity5 armed forces			0
in september , @entity5 district judge @entity64 declared the military 's ban to be unconstitutional			2
the @entity67 has since passed legislation signed by president @entity26 to gradually eliminate " do n't ask , do n't tell , " but @entity70 officials had refused to issue a timeline on when that policy change would be completed			1
it is an issue defense secretary @entity74 , who took over the post this month , will now have to confront			0
if the policy is fully in place , and any current investigations of gay and lesbian service members are suspended , the legal appeals might quickly become moot			1
but the @entity59 have vowed to continue the legal fight until then			0
the group called the court order " exciting news			0
" the ruling " removes all uncertainty -- @entity5 service members are no longer under threat of discharge as the repeal implementation process goes forward , " said @entity89 , the group 's executive director			0
" as a captain in the @entity96 , i have observed the reactions of my colleagues to the @entity70 's move toward open service , and can say with complete confidence that our military is ready , willing and able to take this step			0
@entity59 are proud of our role in ending this unconstitutional and un-american policy once and for all			0
" @entity26 had said he long wanted to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell , " and had reached an agreement with then - defense secretary @entity109 and adm. @entity110 , the previous chairman of the @entity112 , on a process that included a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving			1
the three men would then have to certify the repeal			0
gay rights groups say the policy -- even as it is being discarded -- violates the due process and first amendment rights of military members			2
in their appeals , the @entity59 said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal would be unacceptable and would cause " irreparable harm			1
" the government presented " no evidence to support a finding that open service by gay and lesbian individuals harmed the military 's interests , and ... both civilian and military leaders admitted that @entity139 actually impairs military interests , " the appeal claimed			1
" deference to military judgment here tips the scales against a stay , rather than in favor of one , " it said			0
but the @entity26 administration , supported by @entity70 officials , argued that suspending the policy and forcing the military to immediately change course while the case is being appealed would cause problems during a time of war			1
" the military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years , particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas , " said the government in a prior legal brief			2
@entity70 spokesman @entity165 said the military " will of course comply with orders of the court , and are taking immediately steps to inform the field of this order			2
" he added , " in the meantime , implementation of the @entity139 repeal voted by the @entity67 and signed in to law by the president last december is proceeding smoothly , is well underway , and certification is just weeks away			1
" @entity179 last fall raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under " do n't ask , do n't tell " by ordering that it only be done by the secretaries of the @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			0
in a memo written to the heads of all the military services , @entity109 said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding " do n't ask , do n't tell " law			2
there have been four voluntary discharges -- all from the @entity187 -- in connection with " do n't ask , do n't tell " since october , according to the @entity70			0
@entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
