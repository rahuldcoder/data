@entity0 -- local businesses will have more opportunities to advertise on tv in @entity5 after polls close tuesday night , capping a contentious @entity8 primary race marked by a flood of outside spending -- the most of any other primary battle this election season so far			1
sales managers at @entity5 tv stations said huge ad buys from pacs and super pacs have strained the state 's top advertising markets			1
spending from these groups during this cycle produced an increasingly common scenario around the country : advertising costs rose and local businesses were pushed out of their programming slots or forced to shell out a higher price to stay on air			1
bolstered by the " @entity36 " 2010 @entity30 ruling that removed barriers for corporations to make unlimited donations to groups supporting or opposing individual candidates , independent organizations outspent candidate campaigns			2
in @entity5 , they dropped more than $ 6 million to advertise on broadcast and cable tv , according to @entity42 filings and data provided by the @entity44 , which helps advertisers target specific demographics			1
negative political ads have come to embody the contentious battle between sen. @entity49 and his tea party challenger , @entity52 , and the millions of dollars in added revenue are a financial boon for local stations			1
complicating relationships but the tremendous cash flow has also complicated longstanding relationships with regular advertisers , said @entity60 , general sales manager of @entity62 's @entity61 , a @entity1 affiliate			2
" in some cases they have not been able to buy and in other cases schedules that were placed a while ago have been disrupted because of the sheer tonnage and the higher rates , " @entity63 said			2
" we pride ourselves on managing our inventory and trying to anticipate as best we can , but the spending has been so substantial that no one would have imagined this a few months ago , " he added			0
outside groups spent about $ 1.2 million on ads in @entity62 alone during the first leg of the primary , @entity63 said â € ” and even a slice of that figure is hard to pass up			1
@entity63 said he has done his best to " spread the pain " among advertisers and is planning a charm offensive after the runoff election to recoup clients who were temporarily forced out of their slots			2
" we have n't lost anyone totally , " @entity63 said			0
" ( but ) it 's always a concern that people would look for other means to advertise			0
we realize that clients have a lot of options			0
" a few top ad agencies in @entity5 said their clients have n't been pushed off the air , but that 's because they locked in their air time far in advance or recommended that businesses hold off on tv ads until after the primary			1
in some cases , advertising agencies push their clients toward digital advertising during jam - packed election cycles , said @entity110 of @entity111 , a @entity112 - based advertising agency			2
and his clients are also keenly aware of the market pressures , he added			0
" it 's very clear that the market has tightened up , " @entity115 said			0
" our buyers seemed a little bit apprehensive about how much flexibility they would have right now , in terms of getting exactly what they would want			0
" the situation continued after the race was pushed to a runoff when @entity49 and @entity52 each failed to cross the 50 % threshold in initial primary balloting			2
since , outside groups parachuted into @entity5 with nearly $ 2 million to put more spots on tv			1
unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in @entity5 primary @entity134 , a @entity62 retailer who owns @entity134 's @entity137 , said he decided not to push out his usual @entity139 ad rollout after the primary results came in			1
" i found out about it and i 'm like , ' i 'm not going to get in the middle of that , ' " he said			0
@entity134 added he was concerned people might associate his business with either camp if his ad followed a political spot -- or was sandwiched between two			2
" you ca n't lean for one football team or another , " he said			0
@entity62 stations in smaller markets have also seen a surge of political ads. @entity156 , general manager of several small tv stations in @entity158 in the @entity159 , said political spending has been a financial windfall			2
" first quarter was pretty down for us in the marketplace			0
it has helped our second quarter tremendously with the outside spending , " she said , adding that four different issue groups and one campaign purchased ads in @entity158			2
the northeastern @entity5 city of @entity172 saw about $ 500,000 in political spending -- mostly from outside groups -- injected into its tv ad space			1
the cash flow funneled in by interest groups on top of the campaigns has generated the highest revenue the station has seen in the past three years , @entity182 , general sales manager at @entity172 's @entity184 , said			1
but as in @entity62 , the increase in spending also forced stations into a corner			0
@entity182 said he was been able to shield some of his regular customers from the disruptions of the political cycle , but about 10 % of them have been pushed off the air , he said			0
" we 're able to accommodate some			2
but others , their schedules are just ruined -- especially if they buy during the newscasts , " which offer prime real estate for political groups , he said			1
the @entity202 race is even extending into neighboring @entity203 , with about $ 925,000 in political ad buys in @entity205 , of which only one - third came from the two campaigns			1
@entity205 tv stations dominate northern @entity5 , serving @entity208 , the third largest in @entity5			1
and even in that top 50 tv market , political ads have disrupted schedules and impacted local clients			1
politics : a money game the @entity215 not only ensures that candidates have easy access to the tv market , but guarantees campaigns for federal office the lowest rate available			0
and while super pacs and pacs are not guaranteed the same right to air time , the groups ' deep pockets can get their spots on tv just as effectively as an @entity215 regulation , said @entity231 , the @entity44 's director of political strategy			1
" you get into those sold out situations and there are opportunities for them to pay more to remove a commercial advertiser , " he said			0
" when they 're coming in and they want to influence the election in the last three , four weeks , they often do pay the higher rates			0
" chamber mounting new effort for embattled @entity49 the outsized spending impact of interest groups has resulted in sold out ad programming in markets anchored in some of the most contentious races of the cycle , he said			1
in several states , high - profile elections are attracting millions of dollars in independent spending -- from the @entity8 primaries in @entity257 to those in @entity259 and @entity260			0
nationwide , @entity42 files reviewed by the @entity262 revealed independent spending -- largely due to the impact of " @entity36 " -- has reached $ 72 million for the 2014 primaries , thus far , compared to just $ 23 million during the 2010 primaries and just $ 1.16 million in 2006 -- the last two midterm cycles			2
tipping the scale the @entity5 race attracted more than $ 11 million of this year 's primary figure -- including advertising , direct mail and other expenses from outside groups -- topping the list of primaries most impacted by super pac , @entity278 and nonprofit spending			1
and while @entity49 outraised @entity52 's campaign 3 - 1 , independent spending from outside groups has helped @entity52 slightly edge out @entity49 in the money game			0
the @entity284 spent more than $ 3 million alone in its bid to send @entity52 , currently a state senator , to @entity287			1
that nearly matched the sum of independent spending from groups supporting @entity49			0
and while @entity5 may be fed up with the crush of political ads , a top political analyst in the state said the ads have definitely had a substantial impact on the race			1
" we 'd all like to say we do n't like negative campaigning			0
and in fact , we do n't like it , but it continues to be an unfortunate and objective fact that it affects people 's voting patterns , " author and political commentator @entity301 said , adding that the ads have made the election the subject of almost every conversation			0
nasty @entity8 race digs deeper in the mud but the onslaught of negative ads released by outside groups may also produce a backlash for the @entity52 and @entity49 campaigns , as voters may associate the spots with the candidate they are supporting , @entity301 said			0
in the two weeks leading up to the runoff , several groups purchased additional air time backing -- or bashing -- either candidate			2
@entity49 's groups beefed up their efforts in the final push , with the @entity332 and the @entity333 pushing out nearly $ 1 million in combined ad spending in the last leg of the race			1
@entity52 's supporters did n't back down either			0
the @entity284 announced a $ 600,000 ad campaign to push their candidate over the electoral threshold and @entity36 and @entity341 also jumped into the last - ditch media blitz with more than $ 300,000 , according to @entity42 filings			1
@entity49 's bizarre answer on @entity346 's loss 5 aftershocks from @entity346 's stunning upset loss			0
