-- one priceless car was crushed			1
another , mashed ; a third , pancaked			0
now , @entity2 faces a sinkhole summer			1
a total of eight vehicles at @entity6 , @entity8 's @entity7 remain just as wrecked as they were when the earth swallowed them whole more than two months ago			0
workers fished the last car out of the monster sinkhole on april 9 and so far , not one coat of paint has been applied to any of the cars			1
not one dent has been removed			0
why ? museum officials were shocked by the damage			1
" the last three or four cars that came out of the sinkhole ... we did n't expect them to come out looking quite that bad , " said @entity22 , lead @entity24 restoration member of the museum 's board of directors			1
among the worst - damaged was a custom - made , one - of - a - kind speed demon that can zoom - zoom at more than 175 mph			1
... well , it could			0
the sinkhole reduced it to â € ” as one museum official put it â € ” " just a tire			1
" the whole dirty mess has been enough to make any grease - smeared gear - head cry			1
next month , the museum 's board of directors plans to meet with independent restorers and @entity45 's parent company @entity44 to consider new strategy on how to save the cars			1
" we 'll listen to what they say about it , and then we 'll make a decision as to which car gets restored and to what degree , " @entity22 told @entity0 on the phone			0
surprisingly , the museum may choose not to restore the worst - smashed cars at all			1
and then there 's another problem : what to do about that 40 - foot - wide , 60 - foot - deep sinkhole			1
thank goodness nobody got hurt when it desecrated the museum 's cathedral - like @entity64 in the early morning hours of february 12			1
the idea of a giant hole suddenly opening up inside a museum and stealing away with some of the crown jewels of the auto world grabbed global attention			1
reports estimated the total value of the cars at more than $ 1 million			2
passionate owners and fans still feel the pangs			0
even for folks who do n't care about cars , the @entity24 matters			2
experts call the @entity24 the most collected car in @entity84			0
we 're talking about the " world 's longest - running , continuously produced passenger car , " according to @entity44			2
since the ' @entity89 's 1953 debut , more than 1.5 million have rolled off @entity45 assembly lines , creating jobs for generations of @entity84			1
the sleek silhouette has transformed into a pop culture icon across tv , films and advertising			0
although @entity44 announced back in february that it would " oversee " restoration of the @entity100 , more options are on the table now			2
" recent discussions have changed what the original thoughts were , " said @entity22 , who 's also an officer of the @entity102			0
restoration of some of the cars " may not be possible , " he said			1
or for some of the cars , " it may be best " that an independent restorer other than @entity44 do it			1
related story : check out the 625 - horsepower @entity113 the privately funded , not - for - profit museum is governed by the board of directors - but driven by its donors and 28,000 members			1
do n't think ' vette - heads around the world are n't watching closely			2
and they care about the details			0
" i think they should do it the right way and deliver a finished product like it was n't damaged at all , " said longtime @entity24 owner @entity123 , 47 , of the @entity124			0
" when it 's all said and done , it should look the way it was when it first entered the museum			2
" to outsiders , restoring a @entity24 " correctly " might seem -- well -- kind of anal			0
attention to detail sometimes includes specific engine bolt heads , or original headlights , or even a $ 10,000 set of original tires			0
will the sinkhole cars get that same level of treatment ? " i do n't believe they 'll go that far , " @entity22 said			1
@entity44 's goal is " sensitive restoration , " said its corvette communications manager , @entity147			2
@entity147 is expected to take part in meetings with museum officials where he anticipates a " serious talk to see if they want us to restore all the cars			1
" @entity155 raised from sinkhole @entity44 designer says : save their ' souls ' just be careful , advised @entity160 , @entity44 's director of exterior design for performance cars			1
" they have " character " and " being			0
" replacing too many key original parts might result in " re-creations " rather than restorations , he said			0
@entity160 described himself as a passionate museum supporter who 's not at all involved in the restoration project			1
" you have to ask , what is it going to take to bring some of these cars back to being authentic ? it 's just terrible , but the last two they pulled out are basically pancakes , " he said			2
it 's hard to know for sure -- and too soon to tell , but " maybe they 're better off just leaving them as they are			0
" decisions about which cars to restore might be based on some of these questions : did enough of the car 's unique body panels survive ? does the car still have structural integrity ? did its fundamental framework suffer too much damage ? worst damaged : - 2001 custom - made , one - of - a - kind @entity197 racing car - @entity44 - owned 1993 @entity199 ; fewer than 12 were ever built significantly damaged : - 1984 @entity200 ; a one - of - a - kind car for @entity202 - 1993 @entity204 model ; more than 6,000 were built - 1992 ' 1 millionth ' @entity24 to come off the assembly line - 2009 ' 1.5 millionth ' @entity24 to come off the assembly line @entity207 damaged : - 2009 @entity208 , among @entity44 's fastest production cars - 1962 tuxedo black @entity24 , the oldest sinkhole car related story : @entity44 reveals most powerful drop - top @entity24 institutional memory the black ' 62 poses another big question : does @entity44 still have enough institutional memory to best restore a car that 's more than a half - century old ? should independent specialists be brought in to help ? " it may be best that there 's some other restorer to do it , " @entity22 said			1
" i know @entity44 's got the expertise to go back and take the [ two ] cars they still own and work on them to a certain degree , but as far as structural work ... i do n't know			2
i 'm sure that will enter into the discussion			0
" oh , about that 60 - foot - deep hole in the floor ... in an apparent masterstroke of marketing genius , the museum has put the wrecked cars on display for visitors -- sort of a sports - car version of a carnival freak show			1
also , the museum plans to allow visitors close access to the hole this weekend on a temporary basis			2
they 'll be able to stand in the @entity64 three feet from the edge , where they can get a good look at the natural forces that crushed the cars			2
see how the museum is showcasing the sinkhole the new exhibits appear to be popular			1
march attendance spiked by more than 50 %			0
donations following the sinkhole collapse have already topped $ 75,000			2
" it 's the rubberneck effect , " said museum spokeswoman @entity259			2
the whole mess is now " part of the museum 's history -- and part of @entity24 's history , " said @entity22			0
the idea is , why not embrace it ? museum officials have n't decided on a long - term strategy to deal with the sinkhole			1
there 's talk about leaving the hole open as a permanent exhibit , and building stairs so visitors could walk down into it			0
another option would be to return the @entity64 to its original condition by filling the sinkhole with dirt and replacing the collapsed floor			0
" i personally lean toward securing the hole -- but not filling it -- and creating something like a bridge across it so people can actually look down into it , " said @entity22			0
an accomplished artist , @entity22 has painted a watercolor canvas depicting the hole and the 2009 @entity208 rising out of it			0
if there 's a bright side to the sinkhole collapse , @entity22 thinks he 's found it			0
" millions of people in the @entity24 culture have pulled together over this , " he said			0
" now more people outside the community are discovering how special this culture really is			0

no major repairs have begun on corvettes *recovered* from a giant sinkhole
