@entity0 -- @entity2 prepared saturday for a journey back to a place of darkness in @entity6			1
soon , he plans to stand again in @entity7 , @entity8 at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
only this time , the metal door will not slam behind him , caging him in a bathroom - size cell			2
he will be a free man within the confines of what became a potent symbol of @entity17 's repression -- @entity6 's @entity18			1
@entity2 wants to return to the place where he witnessed a massacre that fuels his nightmares			1
sometimes , he said , his wife would wake him up in the middle of the night , saying , " @entity24			2
you are scaring the kids			2
" as many as 1,200 prisoners were killed at @entity9 in the summer of 1996 , according to @entity28			1
without justice , the infamous event festered in @entity6 's national psyche and eventually acted as tinder to spark the flame of revolt in february of this year			1
rebels stormed the prison a few days ago , freeing those held inside , including an @entity39 journalist			2
" i am so excited about @entity10 , " @entity2 said of the distinct possibility of the capital falling under rebel control			1
" this is the moment i have been waiting for for so many years			2
" since his release in 2000 , @entity2 had thought about @entity9 's dead			1
where were their bodies ? what was it like for their children to grow up without their fathers ? for a wife to not know what happened to her husband ? he vowed to expose the carnage of that june day			2
then this week in @entity59 , he watched a video posted on @entity61 that purportedly showed the storming of @entity9			1
@entity2 , now working with the opposition in @entity59 , knew he had to return there			1
he was waiting to board a plane to @entity10			2
or perhaps , with the fighting still raging in places like @entity17 's hometown of @entity69 , he will have to go by boat			1
with the @entity6 regime on the brink of collapse , @entity2 hopes the truth about @entity9 will finally be known			1
he is hardly alone in his wish			2
the shooting went on for almost three hours @entity2 was a teenage college student when he was arrested for offending the regime			1
inspired by perestroika reforms in the @entity80 in the late 1980s , he spoke out in favor of greater freedoms in his own country			2
@entity2 's mother , @entity84 , clearly remembers that day in 1988 when she returned to her home in @entity59 to find her daughters wailing			1
" we had no idea where he was , " she said from her home in @entity0			0
" whether he was alive or dead			0
" nineteen months passed before @entity91 learned , through contacts , her son 's whereabouts			0
after that , she occasionally made the long trek west from @entity59 to the prison in @entity10			0
the guards would drag her son out of his cell and into a warehouse at the entrance of the jail , where mother and son met			0
if she was lucky , she got 20 minutes with him , she said			0
she could never ask him about his situation			0
there were always guards listening in			0
he could never tell her about what he knew was going on in that jail -- beatings , torture , deaths			0
@entity2 spent eight years that way , in a cramped cell , without his family or the education he should have finished			1
his father died in 1994 and he was released for three days to attend the funeral			0
that was the extent of his freedom			0
then , on june 28 , 1996 , prisoners rioting over poor conditions and restricted family visits seized a guard and escaped from their cells			1
" five or seven minutes after it started , the guards on the roofs shot at the prisoners who were in the open areas , " @entity2 said in an interview with @entity28 many years later			1
security officials ordered the shooting to stop and feigned negotiations			0
but @entity2 told @entity28 that the officials instead called in firing squads to gun down about 1,200 people			1
he said a grenade was thrown into the courtyards where the prisoners were gathered			2
" i heard an explosion , and right after , a constant shooting started from heavy weapons and kalashnikovs from the top of the roofs , " he said			0
" the shooting continued from 11 until 1:35			0
" much later , while buying lamb at a slaughterhouse in the @entity39 , @entity2 commented to his brother @entity154 : not even here can they kill at the rate @entity17 's men did that day			1
" i could not see the dead prisoners who were shot , but i could see those who were shooting , " @entity2 told @entity28			1
" they were a special unit and wearing khaki military hats			0
i saw them -- at least six men -- on the roofs of the cellblocks			0
" the next day , @entity2 was ordered to clean the blood - smeared watches taken off the wrists of the dead			1
@entity28 said it had no way to verify @entity2 's story but another description of the incident from a report by the opposition @entity174 corroborated @entity2 's account			1
@entity17 's government did not acknowledge the killings and denied any crime had taken place			1
more than a decade after the @entity9 incident , the @entity180 noted that the @entity6 government was unable to provide any information on its investigation of the allegations			1
but the families , mostly from @entity59 , now the de facto rebel capital , did not abandon their longing for answers			0
some of them filed a complaint in a @entity6 court in 2007			1
the @entity17 regime offered them compensation in exchange for their silence , according to @entity28			1
but the families refused the money , considering it a bribe			0
instead , they boldly began to protest each saturday in @entity59 , an action unprecedented in @entity17 's four decades of rule			1
" it was radical , " said @entity203 , director of the @entity205 and @entity206 division at @entity28			1
the government began informing some of the families that their loved ones were dead			2
but no bodies was ever returned nor a cause of death given			0
among those waiting to find out more are three brothers in @entity0 whose father , opposition activist @entity216 , was plucked from his home 20 years ago			0
the @entity216 brothers know their father was detained at @entity9 -- they received letters from him in the early 1990s			1
but the letters stopped a few years into @entity216 's imprisonment			0
his sons do not know whether their father was among the massacre victims			0
@entity225 , a @entity6 - @entity39 journalism student in @entity226 , recalled in a blog post the funerals for the @entity9 victims held in the summer of 2009 when she visited @entity59			1
" @entity231 , " each family said			0
verily , we belong to @entity233 , and to @entity233 we return			0
@entity225 tripped over the words in @entity235 , but by the end of her stay she had repeated the phrase so many times that she was fluent			0
" i spent more time in tents that summer than in my own home , the cloth of my black abaya sticking irritatingly to my skin from the @entity246 humidity , " she wrote			0
" in the faces of the family of the dead , i detected relief in the sea of sadness			0
' at least now we know , ' they said			0
" then in february of this year , the regime arrested @entity256 , a human rights lawyer who represented some of the @entity9 families			1
hundreds of people jammed the streets of @entity59 to protest			0
@entity256 was released but the demonstrations did not stop			0
" the memories of that summer come rushing back as i watch the present events in @entity6 unfold from my home in @entity269 , @entity226 , " @entity264 wrote			1
" it was , after all , the @entity9 families who kick - started this revolution			2
it was they who initiated protests in @entity59 in front of police headquarters when their lawyer , @entity256 , was mysteriously detained by security officials			0
" exposing the carnage after 12 years at @entity9 , @entity2 was released in 2000			1
he often cried openly , with flashbacks triggered by something as small as macaroni reminiscent of @entity9 chow , said his older brother , @entity285			2
he eventually made his way to the @entity39 , where @entity154 lived			0
" @entity24 came here and had a mission , " @entity285 said			0
" he wanted to expose the massacre of @entity9			2
" @entity2 told @entity28 about the carnage he witnessed			1
he even approached the @entity291 , which includes the @entity9 massacre in its statements on human rights abuses in @entity6			1
as the civil war raged this year and @entity59 blossomed as a city free of @entity17 's grip , @entity2 , now 42 , returned there from @entity298 , @entity299			1
he took his wife and three children with him			0
he has been working with the opposition television station and telling the world about the dark secrets of @entity9			2
now , as the newly freed prisoners began returning home to @entity59 , @entity2 knew the time had come for him to go back to the prison			1
it is part of his own healing			0
the nation must heal , too , he believes			0
the first step will be to hold @entity6 leaders accountable for what happened at the prison			2
@entity91 is wary of her son 's trip to @entity10			0
she remains fearful about what might happen to him as long as @entity17 is still alive			2
but @entity2 is determined to complete his mission			2
he owes it to all those who survived @entity9			2
but mostly , he owes it to the souls of the dead .			0

@entity2 says he witnessed the 1996 killings of 1,200 prisoners at @entity9
the @entity6 government has never acknowledged a crime
after his release , @entity2 spoke to @entity28 about the carnage
the incident served as a trigger for the revolt against @entity17
