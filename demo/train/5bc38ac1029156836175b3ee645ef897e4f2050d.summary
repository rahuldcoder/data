i would hope he lives to see the new president			2
" both candidates in what the @entity35 called @entity2 's " historic " presidential runoff over the weekend are claiming victory , the latest twist in the country 's chaotic political upheaval			1

@entity2 has not announced an official result			2
the dueling announcements come amid questions over just how much authority the president will even have in the new @entity2			1
the @entity20 , which has run @entity2 since @entity13 's ouster , stripped the position of much of its power			1
under an interim constitutional declaration released monday , the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution can be written and a new parliament elected			0
the declaration says @entity20 members " shall decide all matters related to military affairs , including the appointment of its leaders			0
" the president has the power to declare war , it says , but only " after the approval of the @entity20			0
" that move came days after @entity2 's highest court dissolved the lower house of parliament and the military council announced it had full legislative authority			1

what is the @entity10 ? the april 6 revolutionary movement and the @entity10 called tuesday 's " million man march " in @entity3			1

we object to the military council remaining in power beyond june , " said @entity112 , a @entity10 representative in the @entity113 , @entity2 's upper house of parliament			1
@entity2 's highest court last week dissolved the recently elected lower house of parliament , casting doubt over the future of the @entity113 , which has continued to meet			1
" the constitution is supposed to be in the hands of the @entity2 people , " @entity112 added			2
earlier , @entity126 , a former member of parliament with the @entity10 , complained that the " powerful tv channels " in @entity2 are owned by businessmen collaborating with the military council			2

" @entity182 noted that the @entity2 people again have demonstrated their deep commitment to the electoral process			2
however , the @entity177 expressed grave concern about the broader political and constitutional context , which calls into question the meaning and purpose of the elections , " the agency said in a statement			0
former @entity35 president @entity194 said in the statement , " i am deeply troubled by the undemocratic turn that @entity2 's transition has taken			1
the dissolution of the democratically elected parliament and the return of elements of martial law generated uncertainty about the constitutional process before the election			0
the @entity20 ' new @entity208 , in which they carve out special privileges for the military and inject themselves into the constitution drafting process , violates their prior commitment to the @entity2 people to make a full transfer of power to an elected civilian government			2

an unelected military body should not interfere in the constitution drafting process			0
