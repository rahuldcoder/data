a few months before @entity3 went missing , an enthusiastic plane spotter named @entity1 heard @entity4 was about to stop flying to the @entity5			1
he wanted a photograph of its majestic @entity8 and planted himself at the @entity11 airport at dawn			2
that 's where he snapped a photo of the airplane dancing in the glowing sky			2
" i did n't think much of it , other than that it was a beautiful fall day here in @entity22 , " @entity1 recalled			2
@entity23 , an airline captain , captured a similar image in @entity25 in january 2012			2
" i 'm a spotter			2
i love to watch and photograph the takeoffs of heavy aircrafts , " he wrote of the experience			2
" i know they are not a metal , flying bird ; they connect thousands of people in a journey to happiness			2
" when @entity3 went missing , @entity1 and @entity23 were among the plane spotters who checked their trove of images			1
several found they had photos of the plane when they discovered the registration number matched			1
flight 370 was airplane @entity3			2
these spotters ' fantastical musings of planes in flight turned suddenly to dark speculation			1
" i fly 60 to 90 times a year ; how could this happen ? " asked @entity52 , a @entity53 businessman who captured @entity3 sitting on the runway in @entity55 two years ago			0
" what on earth could have happened to a plane when there is so much tracking ? " plane spotters upload hundreds of images to air buff websites all the time , reflections of their fascination with flight			1
they chat for screen pages about the mechanics and wonder about their far - off destinations and the passengers			1
they invent stories about people from far - flung countries touring faraway lands , on holiday , on business or studying abroad -- just like the passengers of flight 370			1
after the plane disappeared , @entity82 , a visual historian , surfed the airline websites looking for postings of the missing plane			1
" you begin to see how interconnected the world is , " said @entity82 , who once compiled a time - lapse photo project of the rebuilding of @entity89			1
" there is a mystique to flying			0
like everything matters more if it happened on an airline			0
" @entity82 put up a web page with some of the photos and reached out to the photographers for their recollections			1
what is emerging is a visual history of the plane			1
the plane spotters document the @entity3 's travels			1
it spent time in @entity11 , @entity106 , @entity107 , and @entity108 , @entity109			0
it set down in @entity55 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
the dates the spotters shared with @entity2 for the pictures they posted on websites such as airliners.net and @entity119 sync with the dates the plane flew through those airports			1
so does the information they provided about their own backgrounds as pilots or aviation students or ordinary folks with long histories of photographing planes			0
their motive for recording air travel is also well - documented			1
plane spotters seek ' @entity138 ' thrills @entity140 @entity139 said he contributed to the gallery after he had an " oh , wow " moment when he realized he 'd seen @entity3 sitting on a runway in @entity112 on june 27 , 2010			1
the 20 - year - old has taken thousands of images of planes , including the moment he spotted a shiny @entity8 from @entity107			1
" it 's fascinating that we get such a big piece of metal up in the air and fly , " he said			0
@entity153 posted his photo when he discovered he had spotted the missing plane on may 5 , 2013 , in @entity156 , the @entity157			1
" we wanted to wake up early in the morning to catch the most long - haul flights , " @entity153 said			1
" it was a beautiful sunrise at this day as you can see on the picture , and a little bit foggy			0
perfect for catching the early birds			0
" his excitement over capturing a picture of an exotic @entity107 airliner turned to sadness when he realized it had later vanished from the sky			0
" i was so surprised about this and ca n't really believe it			0
they have 105 planes , 15 @entity173 777 - 200 , and i caught exactly this one , i do n't know what i really should ( say ) now , " @entity153 said			1
@entity82 said he believes the plane spotters are deeply affected by having a piece of the airplane 's history			1
" it 's human nature to want to hold on to a piece of something , " said @entity82 , who still marvels at his photos of the towers before 9/11 and talks passionately of his chance encounter with actor @entity182 , who died in a car crash			2
" the human part of you says , ' @entity190 , i have this piece of something that is now missing			2
i have something that is now lost			0
' " @entity52 , the frequent flier , said he feels like each picture allows him to share a special part of an airplane 's history			0
he has been fascinated with planes since he was 4			0
" my father used to take us to @entity202 , and we would just watch , " said @entity52 , who later became an amateur pilot			0
" for me , pilots were heroes , gods			0
the aircrafts themselves with the noise they made and the size of them , the fact that we could fly , it all fascinated me			0
" he remembers the five - hour layover in @entity55 , where he caught sight of the bold white plane with its blue and red streaks sitting on the runway , a glint of sunshine piercing the metal			1
" i was on a business trip on the way home from @entity223			0
i always take free time at airports to take some photos of planes , " he said			2
@entity229 's image on january 30 , 2011 , in @entity112 is the kind of breathtaking photo the plane spotters yearn to capture			1
the sky is cloudy and rain showers are painting the clouds			0
streaks of light pierce the liquid gray sky and illuminate the metal			0
" the moment i saw those images that i took of the plane , i was feeling shock and glad at the same time , because i never believe that plane is now gone and i have in my personal collection a copy of the plane , " he wrote			1
the experience is perhaps most emotional for @entity250 , who snapped his image in @entity108 on august 10 , 2010			0
he was active on a @entity253 chat group for aviation fans when word of the missing plane came through			1
" it 's just sad really , and being a @entity107 myself , i might even have had a ride on that similar aircraft once upon a time ago flying from @entity106 to @entity108 back in the days before @entity261 came to this part of the world , " he said in a message to @entity82			0
" the triple seven is a joy to fly in			0
it 's graceful with its huge twin engine , feeling robust in the air and beautiful to photograph in action with all the flaps down , the triple landing gear bogeys			0
now having learned this is the first total airframe and lives lost of a triple seven in a crash , it 's just unbelievable in this modern aviation world			0
" @entity278 : a mission of hope in search for @entity3 flight 370 : high - tech search tools inside the flight simulator read the cockpit transcript			2

in photos , @entity173 777 - 200 registration number is visible on plane
plane spotters seem both happy and *dismayed* to find they have these images
