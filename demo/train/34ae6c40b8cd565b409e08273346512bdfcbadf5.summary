@entity0 -- with memories of a monster @entity4 blizzard still fresh , another blast of winter weather charged across eastern states friday , with winter advisories issued as far south as middle @entity10			1
a large complex winter system stretched across the @entity12 friday , making for messy commutes in cities like @entity15 , but bringing fewer inches of accumulation than the massive storm that paralyzed much of @entity0 less than two weeks ago			1
by friday afternoon , 391 flights at @entity0 's three major airports had been canceled as a result of snow , according to spokesman @entity23 of the @entity24 and @entity25			1
" overall we 're talking less than 10 percent of the normal traffic , " @entity23 said			0
" most of these flights were canceled before the snow even really started			1
" twenty flights at @entity32 also were canceled as the storm rolled through the region , causing minor delays at @entity36 in @entity37 , officials said			1
several major airlines -- including @entity39 , @entity41 / @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- announced that their customers could voluntarily reschedule flights to and from snow - affected areas without penalty			2
@entity48 expanded the option for passengers flying in and out of not just @entity0 and @entity52 airports but also @entity54 and @entity56 / @entity55 airports			1
the @entity57 issued winter storm warnings , watches and advisories for portions of @entity0 , @entity25 , @entity62 , @entity52 , @entity63 and @entity64 for friday			2
separate alerts also were issued for parts of @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
forecasters projected between 2 and 4 inches of snow across the greater @entity0 area , with heavier amounts expected over eastern sections of @entity75			2
@entity76 was predicted later in the weekend for @entity77 and areas even farther south			0
" i spoke to a couple of folks and they 're just worried about the cleanup work afterwards , " said @entity0 resident @entity83			1
" the last round , they were certainly deficient			0
" emergency workers , criticized for their slow response to the blizzard two weeks ago , will get another chance to prove themselves			0
mayor @entity90 said @entity0 has already instituted a series of changes			2
the heavy snow over the @entity4 weekend hampered morning commuters , delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours , officials said			2
following sharp criticism of the city 's slow response , @entity104 , the chief of the sanitation department , has made management and personnel shake - ups in @entity109			0
an investigation is currently under way into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations about demotions and citywide budget cuts			0
@entity117 also announced that a handful of the city 's 1,700 snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track the vehicles			0
" it gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows , " @entity90 told reporters , saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in @entity0 's @entity109 and one station in @entity128 , where many residents were left snowbound by the previous storm			1
the city is also deploying scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to @entity142 during cleanup efforts , the mayor said .			0
