-- @entity3 troops are battling the @entity5 extremist group @entity4 in neighboring @entity6 , westerners are being targeted at @entity3 tourist resorts and fears are high of terror attacks in @entity10			1
what are the reasons behind the unrest and what is likely to happen next ? what is the source of the unrest ? a state of near - anarchy has existed in @entity6 for more than two decades : the government has little authority , violent conflict has left thousands dead , and the country has recently been hit by a devastating famine			1
pirates have taken advantage of the power vacuum to prey on vessels large and small off the country 's coast , but over the past few months , @entity4 militants appear to have added a new tactic : kidnapping foreign tourists and aid workers in @entity3 ( though some in @entity4 deny involvement in the abductions			1
) @entity4 already generates tens of millions of dollars a year , much of it by controlling ports along the @entity6 coast , according to a recent @entity42 report			1
@entity42 report : @entity4 is raising millions illegally in @entity6 how has @entity3 responded to the kidnappings ? responding to fears that foreign investors and tourists could be scared away , @entity3 forces last month entered @entity6 , saying the kidnappings threatened security and constituted an attack on @entity3 sovereignty			1
@entity3 forces say they are ultimately seeking to take the @entity6 port city of @entity54 , described by the @entity42 as a key stronghold and source of cash for @entity4			1
fears grow over @entity6 pirates ' ' new tactics ' after kidnaps , killing what has been the response ? the incursion has raised fears of reprisals with @entity4 saying it considers it an affront to @entity6 's sovereignty			1
last month ( october ) the @entity69 @entity68 in @entity3 said it had credible information of an imminent terror attack on foreigners			1
the following day , twin explosions in @entity10 killed at least one person			0
many worry the action will make @entity3 less safe , not more so			1
security analyst @entity77 , from @entity78 , told @entity0 : " there is a risk that while the argument for going in is to stop terrorism , the contrary could now be the case			0
@entity4 will now have the pretext to strike @entity3			2
" how likely is @entity3 's operation to succeed ? any foreign intervention in @entity6 is a big risk , say experts who point to recent history as proof , in particular @entity69 's ill - fated " @entity104 " mission in 1993 when @entity69 forces tried to capture a local warlord - resulting in many deaths on both sides , @entity93 's @entity69 - backed invasion that contributed to the rise of @entity4 , and the @entity96 's long and bloody campaign to control the @entity6 capital @entity98			1
" if there is anything we have learnt in the last couple of decades it is that foreign intervention , especially military intervention , does n't work in @entity6 , " said @entity77			2
@entity3 's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy rains and @entity4 's ability to melt into the background			2
however officials say their operation should be over within months			0
" we do n't want to go off and get stuck in @entity6 , " @entity3 government spokesman @entity118 said			1
" when the @entity69 , @entity93 and others went there , they were trying to support an existing government			0
our main objective is just to go in , dismantle the @entity4 and get out			0
" what is the background to the unrest ? @entity6 has known only conflict since the 1991 fall of dictator @entity128 , who had seized power in 1969 , nine years after independence from @entity131 and @entity132			1
meanwhile , as the @entity137 tightened fishing controls in @entity134 , fleets from @entity134 and @entity135 -- many operating illegally -- moved into @entity140 waters to fish			0
according to many reports , in the absence of any @entity6 navy patrols , those fleets plundered fish stocks , decimating the livelihoods of many @entity6 fishermen			2
@entity149 territory for @entity4 in chaos of @entity6 many of these destitute former fisherman " took matters into their own hands , " according to the @entity154 , and turned to hijacking ships to make up for lost income			1
the new " industry " was quickly co-opted by the @entity6 warlords and is now an organized , hierarchical gang - like operation			2
according to academic @entity167 , " @entity6 is like @entity161 in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the @entity166 and more or less forgot about it afterward			2
" in an article written for @entity0 in 2009 in response to the kidnapping of an @entity69 ship captain , @entity167 wrote : " part of combating terrorism means addressing the conditions in which it flourishes			0
extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong , but by ignoring ... the threats to the regional food supply , we effectively created a niche for these pirates			2
" commentary : a lesson of @entity6 pirate attacks how will the unrest affect the region ? with famine causing misery for millions in the @entity190 , the conflict between @entity4 and @entity3 forces is likely to hinder humanitarian efforts			1
even before the incursion , aid workers found it difficult to provide relief , according to @entity198 , consultant researcher on @entity200 's @entity199			0
" if you 've got a big war going on , it 's difficult to distribute relief			0
bombings only increase the risk , " @entity198 said , adding that discussions about access between aid workers and @entity4 were unlikely to be eased by the conflict			0
how is the international community reacting ? the @entity3 government says the decision to attack was its alone			2
key western allies such as the @entity69 and the @entity131 have been quick to state publicly they are not assisting in this action , though the @entity217 say they will help			0
in the region , @entity218 and @entity219 have issued statements backing @entity3			0
" the international community is being quietly supportive , " @entity198 said , " but only because they have no idea what else to do			0
" i 'm sure the @entity69 and others have provided intelligence assistance , but there have been no overwhelming offers of support			0
most governments believe sending troops into @entity6 is not a good idea , but there is no plan b , apart from the status quo			0
" their reasoning is that @entity3 forces could be stuck in @entity6 for ages , or there could be an insurgent campaign in @entity3 itself			1
it could go horribly wrong -- who knows ? "			0
