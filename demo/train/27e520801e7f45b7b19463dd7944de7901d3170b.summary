@entity0 -- a year later , president @entity2 will likely talk differently about @entity3			1
he addresses the nation wednesday night to offer his strategy for " degrading and ultimately destroying " the @entity7 jihadists who have swept across northern @entity8 from @entity3			1
exactly one year earlier -- on september 10 , 2013 -- @entity2 also spoke to the nation from the @entity9 to explain why he called off asking @entity10 to approve air strikes on @entity3 over its use of chemical weapons			1
a lot has changed in the ensuing 12 months , particularly the rise of the @entity17 extremists who call themselves the @entity18 and who seek dominance over a swath of the @entity22			0
here 's a look at what @entity2 has learned about @entity3 in the past year : 1 ) @entity3 president @entity25 is n't going anywhere " i have resisted calls for military action , because we can not resolve someone else 's civil war through force , particularly after a decade of war in @entity8 and @entity34 , " @entity2 said last year			1
while he added that the @entity35 had no interest in removing another dictator from power , he hoped the tide of the @entity3 civil war would go against @entity25 to force him out			2
instead , the @entity3 leader got help from @entity43 in @entity44 and , indirectly , from @entity7 fighters who formed out of @entity47 affiliates to seize the advantage over what @entity35 and allied officials call the moderate opposition in @entity3			1
that forced @entity2 to start providing military aid to opposition forces it considers legitimate and like - minded to @entity56 desires for democratic governance in @entity3			1
2 ) @entity47 affiliates in @entity3 posed a broader threat " it 's true that some of @entity25 's opponents are extremists , " @entity2 said of @entity47 fighters who worked against the @entity3 government			2
he added that failure to respond militarily to @entity25 's use of chemical weapons would allow @entity47 to " draw strength in a more chaotic @entity3			1
" in the end , there was no @entity35 military response after @entity73 's @entity72 voted against taking part and @entity2 knew he would lack congressional approval			2
while @entity25 gave up his known chemical weapon stockpiles , @entity2 's prediction came true as @entity7 fighters comprising remnants of @entity47 strengthened dramatically enough to rampage through northern @entity8			2
3 ) the question of @entity35 military action in @entity3 is complex " i will not put @entity35 boots on the ground in @entity3 , " @entity2 said a year ago			1
" i will not pursue an open - ended action like @entity8 or @entity34			0
i will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like @entity85 or @entity86			0
" now he may propose some kind of air campaign against @entity7 targets in @entity3 , and voices in @entity10 are calling for ground troops from a coalition military force -- but no @entity35			1
the issue raises major geopolitical questions involving who would benefit or be harmed by military strikes in @entity3 , as well as the legality of doing so without approval from @entity25 's government			0
attacking @entity7 in @entity3 stands to benefit @entity25 by weakening what has become an internal enemy and allowing him to portray his country 's civil war as a battle against terrorists opposed by the @entity35			1
strikes by a @entity35 - backed coalition in @entity3 also would give @entity108 , @entity25 's main backer , fodder to justify its own border incursions in @entity112			0
4 ) secure the coalition first " i have , therefore , asked the leaders of @entity10 to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path , " @entity2 said last year after @entity73 rejected joining a coalition to attack @entity3 over its chemical weapons			1
this time , he is expected to detail support from global allies -- including some @entity22 countries -- in going after @entity7 wherever the threat exists , possibly including @entity3			2
in addition , many in @entity10 question if @entity2 needs congressional approval to launch air strikes on @entity7 in @entity3 , with several legislators saying tuesday they doubted a vote would occur before november elections			2
5 ) it 's an election year " @entity35 is not the world 's policeman , " @entity2 said last year			1
" terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong			0
" but when " moderate effort and risk " by the @entity35 can stop atrocities halfway around the world to make @entity35 safer , " i believe we should act , " he added then			0
" that 's what makes @entity35 different			0
that 's what makes us exceptional			0
with humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth			0
" expect to hear the same thing wednesday night , less than two months before the congressional elections , as the president straddles the political fault line between conservative calls for exerting military power and liberal opposition to a renewed war footing			0
his goal is to satisfy moderates and independents crucial to @entity168 hopes of holding on to control of the @entity170 while not angering the party 's liberal base .			0

a year ago , president @entity2 *dropped* plans to bomb @entity3 over chemical weapons
now @entity2 *confronts* the threat of @entity7 jihadists that emerged from @entity3
complex issues surround military action in @entity3 involving @entity35 forces
an election year at home also influences what happens over there
