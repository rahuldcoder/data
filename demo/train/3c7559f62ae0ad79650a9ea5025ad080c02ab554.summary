-- hundreds of mourners remembered fallen @entity2 , @entity3 , police officer @entity4 on thursday in a moving tribute that elicited both laughter and tears			1
@entity9 , 31 , was fatally shot on duty saturday by two teens who had run away from home , police said			1
it appears the teenagers later turned the gun on themselves			2
@entity9 's death has profoundly affected the small town , where he was employed as a police officer for five years			1
just west of @entity20 , @entity2 is known for its luxurious homes and close - knit residents			1
@entity9 was one of only 12 full - time officers in the town with about 2,500 people			1
he left behind parents @entity28 and @entity30 as well as twin sisters			2
" @entity32 and i have been complimented routinely this week by many on what a great job we as parents did in raising @entity39 : someone so loyal , fun , helpful , prankish , caring of others -- a hero , " @entity40 said , his voice quavering during the memorial thursday in @entity46 , @entity3			1
" son , we love you so much , and we 'll miss you dearly beyond earthly measure ... but your legacy of caring , in your @entity39 way , will live on through all of us who remember you , knew you , loved you			1
" @entity28 spoke with affection about his son 's fun - loving , endearing personality that dovetailed with his drive to become a law enforcement officer			1
for @entity58 , that meant working during the day and going to night school			2
" he did n't give up			0
he had a dream , finally got a job at @entity2			1
he was thrilled and very excited			0
from that point , we saw him grow again , and he became increasingly service - oriented and caring of others , " the father said			2
at the time of his shooting , @entity9 had just returned to the force after being on " light - duty status " following surgery for an injury he suffered six months earlier			1
he had responded to a scene involving an autistic person , @entity2 police chief @entity74 said , standing before @entity9 's flag - draped casket			1
recognizing the situation , @entity9 " de-escalated the situation , he went hands - on , and he ended up receiving the injury			1
" following the matter , @entity9 simply asked after the other individual involved			1
" ' chief , i 'm ok , but i really hope that boy 's ok			1
i know he did n't mean it , ' " @entity74 recalled @entity9 telling him			1
" but that 's @entity39			0
without care or concern for himself , he knew the situation			0
" investigators are still trying to piece together the events leading up to @entity9 's death			1
two days before the shooting , @entity97 , 18 , and @entity98 , 17 , both of @entity99 , @entity3 , reportedly ran away from home , leaving only letters behind for their families to find			1
" to my loving parents , i am sorry for all the pain and misery i have brought you both , not just now but from these past few years as well , " begins @entity97 's note , handwritten in neat , even letters			0
" i do n't want to go through life knowing because of my mistakes that i amounted to nothing and was there fore a disappointment			0
do n't take that as me putting the blame on you because that is the furthest thing from the truth			0
both of you have been so amazing with your constant help and support through my life			0
" @entity97 was arrested in february on charges of possession of alcohol while underage and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia			0
he had also been arrested in 2012 in an alleged aggravated assault on his mother , according to incident reports from the @entity135			2
" i love you with all my heart , " the letter continues			0
" please do n't be sad , this is what i want now , i get to die peacefully with the woman i love , the woman of my dreams , my @entity140 © ( yes we were engaged ! )			0
i miss you both so much already			0
" @entity98 penned two loving missives addressed to her sister and father , but to her mother , she directed a bitter letter that suggests the two had a turbulent relationship			0
once the letters were found , the couple 's parents called police to alert them to the teens ' disappearances			1
using cell phone tracking technology , @entity160 police officers found the two parked in @entity97 's car			1
when the officer asked @entity97 to step out of the automobile , he " cranked the vehicle , put the vehicle in drive and sped away , " according to a @entity135 incident report			2
later , @entity160 police filed a warrant to charge @entity97 with resisting a law enforcement officer without violence and reckless driving			2
early saturday , @entity9 encountered the duo walking along a street and called for assistance			2
when deputies responded to the scene , they found @entity9 " lying on the roadway , mortally wounded , " the @entity177 said			2
the deputies performed what is called a tactical rescue , using a patrol car to shield their fallen comrade			0
that 's when they heard two gunshots			0
upon searching nearby woods , @entity189 sheriff 's deputies found @entity97 and @entity98 dead , lying in some brush , from what are believed to be self - inflicted wounds			0
it 's perhaps the lack of any available explanations after @entity97 's death that will haunt his parents the most			0
" we can not comprehend the senseless loss of officer @entity9 's life , the death of @entity206 and for our family , the loss of our 18 - year - old son , @entity209 , " @entity198 and @entity199 said in a statement issued wednesday to @entity0 affiliates wesh - tv and @entity211			1
" words do not exist to express the measure of our sorrow and sadness			0
our deepest sympathy and our heartfelt prayers go out to the friends and family of officer @entity9			2
we are so , so sorry to them for what happened and they will be forever in our prayers			0
we know a community grieves and like everyone else in our community , we ourselves are struggling to understand this most horrific tragedy			0
we have no answers , only questions			0
