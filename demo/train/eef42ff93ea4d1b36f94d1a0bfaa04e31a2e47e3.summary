@entity0 -- the government of @entity3 expressed concerns about @entity6 security regulations that included @entity3 in a list of nationalities that warranted additional screening at airports			1
@entity12 regulations included the kingdom in a " limited group of countries for additional airport screening " adopted in the aftermath of the attempted airline bombing december 25 , according to a cable published by @entity20			1
deputy saudi foreign minister prince @entity21 raised the issue in a meeting with @entity24 , assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , according to a january @entity26 cable published by @entity20			1
according to @entity12 regulations passed january 3 in the aftermath of the failed terrorist attack , citizens and travelers from 14 countries would get enhanced screening when they fly to the @entity6 , possibly including full - body pat - downs , carry - on bag searches , full - body scans and explosive detection swabs			0
the countries on the list include those officially designated as supporters of terrorism -- @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- as well as other countries of interest , including @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity3 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity21 told @entity24 that the issue had caused " a lot of difficulties and embarrassment for @entity3 , " to the point that foreign minister prince @entity64 would raise the issue himself with secretary of state @entity66 at a meeting in @entity68 , @entity69 , the next day			1
according to the cable , @entity21 said that the issue was not the regulation itself but the kingdom 's " inclusion on the list with the likes of @entity44 , which causes @entity3 's friends and enemies to question how strong its bilateral relationship with the @entity6 really is			2
" he also noted the difficulty of explaining this policy to @entity3 , considering that the flights would not have originated in the kingdom while other countries with recent terrorist incidents on airplanes -- he identifies the @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , according to the document -- are not included in this group			2
@entity21 noted that although the provisions were only temporary , @entity3 wanted to know how and when they would be amended			0
the cable also points out that he implied " the longer they remained in effect without any public explanation from the [ @entity6 government ] , the more it was likely to prompt the @entity3 government to re-evaluate areas of cooperation , including counter-terrorism cooperation			1
" @entity24 promised to " convey the spirit and strength of the message " and welcomed " any specific @entity3 suggestions to address the security gap regarding nonmetallic explosives exploited in the december 25 incident			0
" the @entity12 updated its guidance in april , noting that travelers coming into the @entity6 from abroad might notice enhanced screening and security measures , regardless of country of origin			0
this new guidance would apply to all countries and " supersede " the list of 14 countries that offended the @entity3 , which the @entity12 described as " an emergency measure			2
" on the @entity20 documents ' release , @entity124 , the spokesman for the @entity3 foreign minister , said that " these documents do not concern the kingdom of @entity3 nor the kingdom has any role in producing them , nor is it aware of its authenticity			0
therefore @entity3 can not comment on them , however , the policies and positions of the kingdom have always been clear			0
" @entity1 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

he says @entity3 government could be prompted to *rethink* its *counterterrorism* cooperation
