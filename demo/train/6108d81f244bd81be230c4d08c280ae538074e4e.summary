-- after 100 episodes of alternate universes , monsters and shape - shifters , @entity7 's " @entity6 " is coming to an end on friday night			1
it 's set to receive a proper send - off , too , thanks to the efforts of fans who fought for the show through five seasons of time slot changes and dwindling ratings			1
members of the cast , who had been with the show from the first episode , spoke to @entity0 about their favorite " @entity6 " moments , their favorite guest stars and those final days on the set			1
@entity24 , that all - important question : will fans be satisfied with the series finale ? on filming the finale : @entity29 ( " @entity30 " ) : " we knew it would be our last season , and part of that meant that we were able to appreciate it as we were doing it			1
there were lots of little moments of reflection throughout the last couple of months			0
" @entity47 ( " @entity48 " ) : " what caught me by surprise was how emotional i got ( shooting the final episode ) -- not about the show , per se -- but about the people			1
so that was kind of intense			0
" @entity55 ( " @entity56 " ) : " for me it was a feeling of joy -- when they called that final wrap and you see the faces of the people you did four or five years with , you think this is something we all did together			0
there 's what i hope is a really good scene between @entity67 and myself in the finale , in the lab , fittingly			1
and there was a feeling like , ' wow , that 's the last time we will play father and son , in this room that has been such a part of our lives for these last five years			1
' " @entity29 : " i went down to see @entity79 's last scene			1
he was doing a scene in the lab that i was n't in			0
i got to sit back and watch @entity82 for the last time and that kind of made me sad , because @entity67 and @entity82 were such a beautiful fit			1
just to think ' ah ! @entity67 is never going to breathe life into him again , ' was kind of sad			0
" @entity79 ( " @entity88 " ) : " it 's unbelievable to go out on our own terms			2
unheard of in this industry to be able to finish a story off in the way that we have			0
i 'm just seriously grateful to the network and studio for giving us the chance			0
" @entity100 ( " @entity101 " ) : " i have watched way too many shows on television that started out wonderfully and then seemed to continue on a downward spiral once it reached its peak			1
i am thrilled to have taken part in a show that knew what both its ending and beginning looked like , and never tried to overextend itself			2
" on lessons learned : @entity55 : " the whole experience of ' @entity114 ' was new to me			0
i knew intellectually it was a big deal to have a show run for five - and - a - half years			2
but this time around , i think i had a much deeper understanding of just how difficult it is to get a show to run			2
this show , in particular , kept on defying all the odds			1
" on their favorite moments : @entity79 : " the most fun ( version of @entity82 ) to play was the simple old @entity82 who was just a scattered genius with no social graces and completely inappropriate			0
that was the most fun			0
i had a lot of affection for ' @entity88 , ' who was originally very hard to get accepted by audiences and ultimately was			0
" @entity100 : " my favorite episodes were the ones when all the doppelgangers got to meet each other			1
i loved how each character had a different experience when they saw their ' other ' for the first time			0
they were beautifully written and beautifully performed			0
" @entity29 : " i was so grateful that they really stuck it out with the different universe			0
it was so fun , it was like a different show			2
it was great to play this lighter character ( @entity30 ) after being with @entity30 for two years at that point			0
" @entity47 : " my most memorable scene -- well , there was the scene where @entity153 kisses @entity48			2
@entity155 's a good kisser so that was great -- but my most memorable scene was this season , the reunion scene under the bridge			1
that moment when i see @entity30 again and she calls me by my first name			2
" @entity55 : " the thing i will miss the most is that father - son dynamic with @entity82 and @entity56			0
" on the guest stars : @entity79 : " to share the floor with ( @entity166 and @entity167 ) was amazing for me , because they 're such iconic figures in themselves			1
and @entity169 is an amazing actress , she played my wife			0
" @entity47 : " the second season , i walk in the makeup trailer and @entity172 is right in front of me			0
i stopped and my eyes bugged out			0
and @entity166 , he 's done so much brilliant work over the years			1
with him , it was like having a walking icon on the set			0
in this business , you often call people by their first name			0
but for him , it was always ' mr. @entity166			1
' it 's funny because he 's been on enough times that i forget , but of course , @entity167 ( was a favorite )			1
" @entity191 : about @entity167 's response to @entity29 's impression of @entity167 's @entity194 in one episode : " he was very , very kind			1
" on how the fans will receive the final episode : @entity55 : " a lot of tv , you can just turn off your brain and watch , but ' @entity6 ' always asked its audience to be more engaged than that , and at our very best , challenged the audience to think about the core ideas that ( executive producers @entity208 and @entity210 ) were putting into the show			1
there are experiences along the way that are things that i will probably remember for the rest of my life			0
it is the passion of the fans that kept it going			2
@entity223 , long past the time when it made economic sense , and certainly past the time where my cynical - actor - who 's - been - around - self looked at it and went , there 's no way this show is coming back			1
if it was n't for that passion , the show would have died and it would n't have the proper ending that it 's going to get this friday			1
it 's because of those experiences and because of those fans that we were able to finish up the show on the right note			1
" @entity100 : " i think that the ending is beautiful , and perfect , and it could n't be written any other way			1
i was surprised at the ending , but even so , i thought it was absolutely excellent			0
it 's a roller coaster ride , and let 's just say the ending does n't exactly bring you back to where you decided to climb on			2
" @entity55 : " i do n't think it 's possible to satisfy everybody			2
i hope that people find the finale satisfying and a just reward for their dedication over the course of the last five years			2
i was very impressed with the script when i read it			0
i hope that episode does justice to the people who have been with us from the very beginning			2
i hope we finished on a strong note			0
that 's the best gift we can give as the people who make ' @entity6 ' to the people who watched ' @entity6 , ' is not to go out with a whimper but with a bang			1

" @entity6 's " 100th episode is also its last
cast members *credit* the fans for keeping the show going , against the odds
memorable guest stars for the cast *included* @entity167 and @entity166
@entity100 calls the finale " beautiful and perfect "
