-- with her sumptuous voice and glamorous looks , @entity2 opera star @entity1 is one of the most popular ambassadors of classical music today			1
discovered by maestro @entity8 when she was aged 22 , cleaning the floors of the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity7 has grown to become one of the world 's greatest living sopranos			1
since the @entity17 - like beginning of her career , the @entity2 diva has charmed audiences at major opera houses across the world , including @entity23 's @entity22 , @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity27 's @entity26			1
along the way , @entity7 's charm has helped her build a celebrity status rivaling that of a pop star			1
the 39 - year - old soprano has her own music videos and is a global ambassador for luxury jeweler @entity35 , while @entity36 has placed her in its " sexiest babes of classical music " list			1
@entity7 opened up to @entity0 's revealed about her first steps , her bubbly personality and how motherhood could transform her career			1
@entity0 : how did it all begin , what was your first job in an opera house ? @entity1 : do n't ask me to tell you about cleaning the floors -- it was n't really a job			1
we were young , we wanted to spend a lot of time in the theater			2
it was very easy for us to watch performances -- opera , ballet , concerts -- we did n't have to pay for any of that			1
working there as a cleaning lady was very convenient			0
i worked for two years when i was in my first years of studying			0
@entity0 : magazines like @entity36 said you were sexy -- what did that say about the stereotypes of opera and how your image challenged them ? an : this is very hard to say -- i would say if you can not really sing , they will not take you seriously			1
they might bring you up to @entity76 for a few days but after that , if you 're nothing you 'll fall down			0
your good looks and craziness will not help you in this particular profession because this profession is very serious			0
there were a lot of people who said i did n't have a voice and i did n't have talent -- it 's just a flash around me			1
but you know what ? i took it in one ear and threw out of another one			0
how can you prove what you really are ? you have to work -- that 's what i did			2
i continued doing my photo shoots but i 've always been very serious -- all my colleagues will tell you that			0
@entity0 : how does your image help make opera more popular , more accessible ? an : i do n't know if i 'm helping to bring classical music to a wider audience -- maybe , i do n't know			2
but still , the audience has to learn to love classical music , not the image but the music itself ; this is what 's important			2
@entity0 : you have a bubbly personality			1
do you think that opera people feel you have to have a strict personality ? an : no ! i am who i am but of course there are responsibilities			1
i have to be careful -- i can not party all night and then be destroyed for a few days because i practically do n't have a few days to rest			0
there 's very little time to get yourself together			2
@entity0 : why do you think you get picked to play these young roles ? an : in opera , it 's everything about the voice and possibility			1
i have a lyric soprano [ voice ] so i can sing certain roles and usually they are the young girls			2
if i had a dramatic soprano [ voice ] i would sing @entity131 -- all these serious dramatic heroines			2
@entity0 : when do you think you 'll make the transition to older roles and how do you feel about it ? an : oh , i have to , soon			0
my voice is changing and i also want to try something new			0
i do n't know what happened to me , but i think after the baby my voice suddenly became big			0
sometimes i 'm reading critics saying the voice is too big , she has to do more dramatic repertoire			0
maybe this is what i 'm trying to do , slowly , because if you move too fast you can destroy your voice			0
it 's happened many times with lots of singers so i have to be careful			1
@entity0 : does the pressure ease off when you become a star ? an : no , the pressure of being good at a performance will never go away			0
because to go on @entity76 is one way , and fast , but to stay there is very hard			0
it 's just a few years really , a few golden years of your career you can really stand at a very high level			2
