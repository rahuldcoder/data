-- the streets of @entity2 can be an unforgiving place for the city 's taxi and public transport drivers			1
chronic traffic jams and badly maintained roads are part of the daily grind but add in the possibility of floods during the annual typhoon season and a strong constitution is needed			0
but @entity16 does n't mind , and as one of the city 's few female drivers will happily take to the streets in her electric jeepney as long as she is able to , come rain or shine			1
@entity16 is one of three women driving @entity2 's 20 - strong fleet of electric public vehicles that ply the streets of @entity27 , the capital 's central business district			1
if her vehicle is a rare sight among the traditional diesel - spewing jeepneys on the roads , even rarer is seeing a woman behind the wheel of a vehicle of any description			0
" all our passengers are happy if they see women drivers because they think the lady drivers are honest , " says @entity16			1
" our jeepneys are better taken care of , we clean our own and decorate them at our own expense			0
" @entity16 was a taxi operator and then driver before switching from her petrol - powered cab to an electric jeepney in march			2
it was her good fortune that one of the fares she picked up from the airport last year was @entity53 , ceo of @entity54 , who suggested she swap her taxi for an electric jeepney and with it gain a steady form of employment			2
like other drivers of taxis and jeepneys , @entity16 regularly used to work shifts of up to 24 - hours in order to pay for the hire of the vehicle and then make enough money to support her family			2
being an electric jeepney driver is the first time that @entity16 has had the benefits and security that most people expect with a job -- a daily shift of eight - hours , health insurance and a weekly paycheck			2
the e-jeepneys of @entity27 are still officially a pilot initiative , but only bureaucratic red tape has prevented it from becoming commercial and charging passengers 8 pesos ( $ 0.20 ) per ride , says @entity82 , project coordinator for the @entity83 , which organizes the @entity27 - based project			0
" as well as the environmental impact , we wanted it to help women to have the same opportunity as male drivers , " says @entity85			1
" economically and socially women are one of the most vulnerable sectors in society , we wanted them to enjoy the same benefits from the electric jeepney project , such as increased income			1
" statistics suggest that women in the @entity100 have been successful in gaining ground against men			2
ranked eighth on the @entity104 's @entity103 , the @entity100 outperforms the @entity105 , @entity106 and all other @entity108 countries in terms of gender equality in economic opportunity , health , political participation and education			0
according to the figures , women outnumber men in the field of senior officials , managers and professional and technical workers , but still lag behind men in terms of equal wages			0
despite some gains for women in the workplace there are plenty of hurdles still to overcome , believes @entity131 , chair of the @entity132			0
" discrimination in hiring is something we 're aiming to work on			0
while jobs wo n't officially advertise for a man , there will be criteria which points to men and not women , like ' we need someone six - feet tall , ' or request a qualification that makes it clear men need to be hired			0
" notions that traditional diesel jeepneys are too heavy for women to drive are slowly being eroded , or completely bypassed with lighter electric versions , although @entity16 says that even her family still finds it funny she drives a jeepney			1
macho attitudes from male drivers could also still deter other women from wanting to get behind the wheel			1
" sometimes the male drivers , like taxi drivers , they bully women drivers , overtake unnecessarily and think that women drivers ca n't do what they are doing , " says @entity16			1
but when it comes to fare - paying passengers , @entity16 believes most would like to see more women on the roads			0
our passengers are comparing women drivers in other countries , and society in the @entity100 already accepts that women drivers are much better ( than men ) , " she says with a smile .			1
