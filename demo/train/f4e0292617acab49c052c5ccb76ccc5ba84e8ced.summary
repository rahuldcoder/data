prominent @entity3 lawyer and reform advocate @entity0 was sentenced on sunday to 15 years in prison and a 15 - year travel ban to be applied after his release from jail for , among other things , " inciting public opinion against the government " and " insulting the country 's leaders and judiciary , " according to human rights activists in @entity15			1
he was also ordered to pay the sum of 200,000 saudi riyals ( $ 53,000 )			0
and , according to official @entity3 news agency @entity17 , he is required to close any websites affiliated with the organization he heads , the monitor of @entity22			0
the government said the group was run illegally as an unlicensed organization that attempted to prejudice the public against the government			0
" this is the price @entity0 was expecting as a result of his defense of human rights and standing with the oppressed , " the group said in a statement			1
@entity0 has called for government reforms including the creation of a constitutional monarchy , the release of political prisoners and the expansion of women 's rights			1
his wife , @entity41 , told @entity42 her husband does not accept the verdict , nor will he appeal it , as he does n't recognize the legitimacy of the court or its ruling			1
@entity41 , who was present when the sentence was read , added , " this verdict was far from just			2
@entity0 was tried and sentenced simply for his work as a human rights activist			1
" @entity52 , which has been closely monitoring the trial , condemned the verdict shortly after it was issued			2
" @entity57 's harsh sentence shows that @entity15 has no tolerance for those who speak out about human rights and political reform and it will go to any length to silence them , " said @entity3 researcher @entity55			1
it 's the second time in less than a year that @entity0 , one of @entity15 's leading and most outspoken liberal voices , has been found guilty by a @entity3 court			1
in october , he was sentenced to three months in prison for signing statements critical of the @entity3 government and of @entity3 officials			0
just as that case was winding down in a court in @entity75 , another one against @entity0 was gearing up in @entity76 -- this one at the @entity77 , a venue known for trying accused terrorists			1
charged with " speaking to the foreign media with the intention of harming the country 's reputation " and " breaking allegiance with the @entity85 , " @entity0 refused on many occasions to recognize the legitimacy of the court			1
in april , while attending the fifth hearing of his trial , @entity0 was arrested			1
he 's been incarcerated ever since			2
despite repeated attempts , @entity42 was unable to reach @entity15 's @entity92 or @entity93 for comment			1
human rights organizations say @entity0 's conviction is simply the latest in a long line of disturbing instances where activists have been deliberately targeted and prosecuted in @entity15 , an absolute monarchy with little tolerance for dissent			1
" as @entity15 sits as a member on the @entity104 in @entity105 , " said @entity55 , " its courts back home are locking away peaceful activists on harsh sentences merely for calling for reform and respect for human rights			2
" in may , @entity113 was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes by a @entity3 court for insulting @entity117			2
@entity41 , @entity0 's client and brother - in - law , first got into legal trouble with the @entity3 government after starting a liberal website and forum where users could discuss religion			1
april saw activist @entity125 receive a 15 - year sentence and 15 - year travel ban for " breaking allegiance with the @entity85 " and " harming the reputation of @entity15 by speaking with foreign news agencies			0
" in 2013 , two of the country 's most vocal reform advocates , @entity131 and @entity134 , were each sentenced to 10 years in prison and a five - year travel ban			2
both were found guilty of providing inaccurate information to foreign media and founding and operating an unlicensed human rights organization , as well as other offenses			2
human rights organizations may be outraged by these outcomes , but they 're hardly surprised			0
earlier this year , the @entity3 government passed a series of very strong and sweeping anti-terror laws that many groups feared would be used as a way to quash dissent			0
in a statement , @entity52 said : " @entity15 's new terrorism law and a series of related royal decrees create a legal framework that appears to criminalize virtually all dissident thought or expression as terrorism			0
the sweeping provisions in the measures , all issued since january 2014 , threaten to close down altogether @entity15 's already extremely restricted space for free expression			0
" in 2013 , @entity0 spoke to @entity42 via @entity163 from @entity15 , as he was under a travel ban			1
he said any activist who calls for reform there is in danger of being arrested			0
" here 's the thing , " @entity169 explained			0
" the government of @entity15 , they want to show themselves outside @entity15 that they are modern , that they are open - minded , that they want to change , they want to reform , that the problem is coming from the society , and that the society moves slowly			0
they keep saying that for the foreign media			0
but actually inside , when we act with our society , when we want to reform , when we want to do something with our society , they keep punishing us			0
" @entity3 activist sentenced to 10 years , 1,000 lashes for insulting @entity117			0

@entity0 called for reforms , release of political prisoners , women 's rights
his wife says he does n't accept the verdict
