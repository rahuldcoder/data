@entity0 -- amid the crush of migrant workers who gathered to see @entity4 in @entity5 wednesday was @entity6 , a @entity7 worker who has been in @entity8 for 17 years			1
he took his son , two - year - old @entity9 , to greet the @entity7 opposition leader on her first visit outside @entity7 in more than 20 years			1
they gathered with thousands of others outside a migrant center on the outskirts of the @entity8 capital where @entity4 spoke to an elated and emotional crowd , many of whom said they never thought the day would come			1
" there 's no better feeling in the world than what happened , " @entity6 told @entity1 through migrant rights activist @entity19			2
" he said he 's happy beyond words , can not describe the feeling			0
so positive , " said @entity19			0
@entity19 described walking about the streets in the suburb of @entity28 , home to the highest concentration of @entity7 migrants in @entity8 in the hours before @entity4 's arrival			1
" all the workers were saying they just thought it was rumors			2
they said until they actually saw her face , they still did n't believe it , " he said			0
" and then she was there , speaking to them			0
they did n't feel like she was there , they were so amazed			0
" from a balcony high above the crush of people , @entity4 told them that she would try her best to look after migrant workers ' rights			1
" the laws of this land which do provide protection for workers are not always observed by everybody concerned , " she said			2
" we need to educate our workers as to their rights , by what kind of legal means there are for defending their rights , because whatever we negotiate with our host government we want to do it in a harmonious way			0
of course we will also be asking for help and support from the local authorities , " she said			0
there are around three million migrant workers in @entity8 , of which around 80 % are from @entity7 , according to the @entity74			1
they were lured by the promise of work to support their families from a country where jobs are scarce			0
" we do n't have any jobs so i came to @entity8 , " @entity6 told @entity1 in @entity81			1
in the past 17 years @entity6 said he had worked in just about every lowly - paid job open to migrants in @entity8 : in construction , on fishing boats and at the factories back at port , where workers peel prawns and package seafood for export			1
according to a recent @entity96 , the poor regulation of migrant workers under @entity8 law makes them vulnerable to exploitation			1
" irregular migrants are in a vulnerable position owing to their migration status , and are often exposed to abuse and exploitation , including physical or psychological abuse , poor working or living conditions , withholding or non-payment of wages , and excessive working hours , as well as arbitrary arrest and extortion by law enforcement authorities , " stated the report , by the @entity99 on trafficking in persons , @entity101			2
@entity8 responded to the report by saying it contained " inaccuracies or errors concerning relevant laws , policies and processes			2
" it added that some recommendations from the report had already been undertaken			0
@entity19 said most , if not all , the migrant workers he 's spoken to in @entity8 want to return to @entity7 , if only there were jobs			1
" they never wanted to be here in the first place			0
they 've been caught between two hells , one hell in @entity7 and one hell in @entity8 , " he said			1
" they never wanted to be here in @entity8			2
it 's not their homeland and they 've not been welcomed here in terms of their human rights			0
they 've been welcomed here as laborers who do cheap work , " he said			0
amid the sweltering heat , @entity4 said that it was up to @entity7 migrants as well as the government to create a @entity7 that could welcome them back			1
" everybody has a responsibility			0
they too [ @entity7 workers ] have a responsibility and we too have a responsibility to create the kind of country to which all our people can return , whenever they wish too , " she said			1
however , one @entity7 expert said more changes needed to be made within the country before many @entity7 migrants would consider going home			1
" people need to be assured that there will be some kind of rule of law around property and around individual businesses to feel safe to return , " said @entity162 , pro vice-chancellor of international and major projects at the @entity164 in @entity165			0
" the nationalization of businesses , for example , the use of middle men , the increasing taxation that continues to be leveled , those kinds of economic parameters need to change , " she said			0
" the ability to own property and not have it confiscated by the state ... even in border areas you 've got to be assured that the @entity7 soldiers are not going to steal your chickens or levy you for a quarter of your rice quota , for example			2
