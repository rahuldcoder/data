@entity5 's death thursday solidified the power of the @entity59 , which marked the country 's liberation on sunday in the eastern city of @entity63 , where the uprising started			1
but uncertainty was still swirling sunday about the death of the @entity1 leader , who @entity1 and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes			2
leaders of @entity1 's interim government have said @entity5 was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him thursday			1
but others have questioned that account			0
@entity76 , @entity77 's emergencies director , told @entity2 that fighting had ended when @entity5 was cornered in a drainage ditch			1
he said crowds beat @entity5 in what was a " humiliating end " for the former dictator			2

@entity130 , chairman of the @entity59 's executive board , has said @entity5 's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and @entity5 loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle			1
