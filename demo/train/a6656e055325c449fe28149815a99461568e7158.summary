, and # @entity13 ( if my daughter brings home a black guy )			0
last fall , under pressure from @entity2 advocacy group @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , @entity14 agreed to remove some offensive tweets			1
in october 2012 , at @entity20 's request , @entity14 also suspended a @entity22 neo-nazi account based in the city of @entity24 , the first time the company had responded to such a government request			2
however , at the time , the @entity17 also wanted identifying information of the perpetrators , which @entity14 was not prepared to give up			2
so the group went to court to force the issue			0
on thursday , the @entity32 in @entity33 ordered @entity14 to identify the authors of anti-semitic tweets by creating a mechanism ( @entity36 ) to alert @entity2 authorities to " illegal content , " on its @entity2 site " in a visible and easily - accessible [ way ]			1
" if @entity14 does not comply within two weeks , the @entity42 company faces fines of â ‚ ¬ 1,000 ( $ 1,336 ) per day			1
how " free " should " free speech " be ? this is n't the first time that @entity2 courts and laws have butted heads over idiotic racism online			2
less than a year ago , then - president @entity51 proposed a law that would make even viewing a hate site a crime			0
here in the @entity42 , we have a @entity56 protected near - blanket right to free expression			0
although incitement to violence is generally not protected , hate speech -- no matter how disgusting and awful -- is			1
as we 've reported before , the operating principle in @entity42 has generally been that undesirable speech should be countered with more speech , not less			0
that 's not the approach taken in @entity66 , where hate speech is most definitely not protected			2
many @entity69 states ( and even some @entity71 countries in @entity66 ) have various types of anti-hate speech legal mechanisms , in part to head off terrorism and far - right violence			0
" we 're not able to identify the individuals , only @entity14 can do so , " @entity78 , @entity17 's vice president , told the @entity2 broadcaster , @entity80			1
" we 've already tweeted the decision			0
and we see on @entity14 that the decision has apparently triggered a new rise of anti-semitic messages directed against our organization , so there is still work to be done , both by us and @entity14 , but we 're happy the @entity2 justice is now changing the way it is			1

@entity14 must identify *posters* of hate speech , @entity2 judge says
the site has been home of *multiple* racist , homophobic and anti-semitic *trends* in @entity2
@entity14 already agreed to remove some offensive @entity2 tweets
site must comply or pay $ 1,336 a day , judge ruled
