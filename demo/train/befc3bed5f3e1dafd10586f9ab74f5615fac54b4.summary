-- @entity1 is probably not the first face that comes to mind when you think of a poster child for bullying			2
yet there she was , sitting in the back of @entity9 as it rolled through the streets of @entity12 , @entity13 , on monday afternoon			1
four middle school boys barraged her with verbal abuse , jabbing her about her weight , attacking her family and chuckling as they made violent and graphic threats			1
except for a few even - keeled retorts , the 68 - year - old bus monitor brushed sweat from her brow and remained quiet , peering up front and out her window , seemingly waiting for her hellish ride to end			1
her suffering may have gone unnoticed had not one of the young teenagers posted a 10 - minute video of the harassment on @entity30			1
by wednesday , police were interviewing @entity32 and her alleged verbal abusers			2
and by the next day , as the video began going viral , she had become a cause @entity37 ¨ bre			1
her torment became a prism through which total strangers the world round characterized her experience as symbolic of everything wrong with modern - day parenting , children and more			1
beyond anger , some expressed sadness for the seemingly defenseless older woman who , they felt , bravely suffered the slings and arrows flung at her for no good reason at all			2
@entity32 ignored bullies , until suicide taunt " i could n't watch the whole video -- i do n't know how you live through it , " wrote one woman , @entity56 , in an online post			1
" @entity60 bless , you are my hero			2
" yet bad things happen all too routinely , with people abused and killed most every minute in most every corner of the world			1
so why did one grandmother 's videotaped bus ride become so engaging and emotional for thousands of people she has never met , prompting them to issue emotional pleas to police and to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars ? count @entity32 among those taken aback by all the attention			1
after hearing from @entity0 's @entity76 that @entity77 offered her and nine others an all - expense - paid trip to @entity81 to go to @entity82 , she described it as " awesome " but seemingly too good to be true			2
" i still ca n't believe it , " she said thursday night			2
" i do n't feel like i 've done anything			0
" but the reaction is n't entirely surprising to @entity87 , a social psychology professor at the @entity88			0
the fact the attacks are so pointed and @entity32 's pain so apparent makes it easy for people to identify with as she soldiers through a torrent of verbal abuse			1
" it 's such a clear case of somebody who is being bullied , " said @entity87			1
" she 's all alone , and she has no allies			0
... and what the kids are saying is so obviously hurtful			0
... it 's so compelling that you ca n't turn away			0
" stranger sets up ' kindness for @entity1 ' @entity108 page and for all the statistics about the number of people bullied each year or perhaps news reports about elderly being targeted , people tend to respond more -- and more viscerally -- to a person being attacked and suffering with their own eyes , the professor states			1
" we feel much stronger feelings for an individual than we do for ... an abstract group , " @entity87 said			1
@entity121 was one of those people moved by @entity32 's plight			1
living in @entity124 , he 'd never met her but said the @entity30 video " struck a chord with me , " a feeling that -- as someone who 'd been bullied himself -- he could n't let go of without taking action			1
" i felt very sad for @entity1 , and i felt i had to do something to support her in this time , " he said			0
his first thought was to raise money through the site @entity136 , hopefully enough " to get her away from the environment and get her on vacation somewhere			0
" so he set up the site , hoping to amass $ 5,000 over the next month			0
by late friday afternoon , that fund had more than $ 545,000			0
family of bullied bus monitor asks for threats against students to stop donors like @entity56 gave not only their money but their heartfelt support for @entity32 in remarks posted on the website			1
" @entity1 , i am so sorry that these children were so mean to you , " wrote one commenter named @entity151			0
added a man , identified as @entity155 , " i hope the recognition that thousands and thousands of people heartily dislike what those children did helps you feel a little better			1
" yet many on that site , as well as @entity0 's story -- which was shared on @entity108 by more than 35,000 people as of thursday night and had more than 6,300 comments -- levied blame , as much as they offered support			1
many chastised modern - day children and parenting for fostering such behavior			0
some criticized the bus driver for not halting the verbal abuse , even though @entity12 police capt. @entity176 stressed that it took place on the back of a noisy bus , far from the driver			2
and a few even singled out @entity32 for not being more forthright to stop it			0
when a bullied kid grows up " children have no respect because they are not taught to respect , " a @entity0 commenter with the handle @entity185 wrote			0
" ask the nearest child to you the meaning of the word and you probably would not get a sufficient answer			0
" police and town leaders in @entity12 -- a community that has nearly 100,000 residents , three school districts and nearly 42 square miles of area yet still proudly sees itself as a town , one where things like this just do n't happen -- talked about being peppered with messages from around the world decrying the episode			1
while condemning the outrage , town supervisor @entity208 tried to assure people that these four boys did n't represent the entire community			1
he described his " town " as a place full of people " who are kind , respectful neighbors and hardworking , " much like @entity32			2
online and in messages to school and police officials , many demanded that the youngsters overheard in the video be arrested			1
@entity176 said he 's " gotten e-mails from the @entity226 ( and ) from all over the @entity227 saying prosecute , prosecute			0
" " i feel it			0
i feel it , " he said			0
" but we have to follow the law			0
we ca n't tailor the law to meet this case because of public outrage			2
" @entity235 says bullies beat him , sues @entity13			1
schools police also said the seventh - graders had received death threats from people near and far			2
for example , @entity176 said , one of their cell phones " had over 1,000 missed calls and 1,000 text messages threatening him			0
and he is a 13 - year - old			0
" @entity87 , the @entity88 professor , said she 's not surprised by the communal desire for justice			0
she said this could be explained through the " just - world hypothesis , " the belief that people think the world should be good -- and when it is not , especially when a blameless and vulnerable person suffers as a result , someone needs to be punished			1
" clearly , something is wrong , this should n't be happening , " @entity87 said			0
" there 's a sense somebody needs to be blamed			0
... people feel the need to balance the scope			2
" one person not calling for the four boys to be thrown behind bars is @entity32			2
the bus monitor said that , right now at least , she does not want police to pursue criminal charges			1
but @entity32 would like to see them banned from the bus and athletic activities and , most of all , wants to make sure they do n't bully anyone else			2
" i want to make sure that they never do this again , to anybody , " she said			0
what would you do with a mean kid ?			0
