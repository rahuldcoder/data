@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity10 's " @entity9 " is already in its third season and it is one of the most watched shows on cable			1
the last show on @entity10 to garner as large an audience was " @entity13			2
" the show has tons of fan sites and more " @entity9 " fanatics worldwide than you can shake a stake at			1
so what better time to launch a comic book right ? well , that 's exactly what creator @entity23 thought			1
he , along with publishers @entity25 and @entity10 , are putting out the first " @entity9 " comic book in a series which debuts at @entity29			1
but if you think it 's just like the tv show , think again			2
@entity2 recently spoke with @entity23 about the comic book , the show and what 's next for " @entity9			1
" @entity2 : so we are going into the third season of " @entity9			1
@entity2 : it 's as popular as ever			1
there could n't be a better time to bring out the comic book			1
ball : well , we were approached last year by some comic book publishers and it seemed like a great fit			1
i mean it seems like there 's definitely characters and a story to fill comic books outside of the world of the show			1
so i said yeah , let 's go for it			2
we got together and we talked about stories , and we came up with a story			0
now issue one is ready and it 's going to be available at @entity29 on july 21			1
@entity2 : was it hard to create this comic book series ? ... the tv show is based on a book , so are you paralleling the comic book to the actual show ? ball : well it was a little difficult for me because comics are such a distinct medium in which i have never worked			1
so i had to learn a little bit about the medium and what it was all about			0
what we decided to do was to take the characters of the show and put them in a story that 's independent of the show itself , but is very true to the mythology of the show			2
it 's not something that is dependent on the show or the show is dependent on it , which makes a lot of sense			2
@entity2 : but is it hard to essentially write two different " @entity9 " scripts ? ball : well , you have to stay on top of the mythology			1
you ca n't have vampires being made one way in the comic book and a different way in the show			1
you ca n't have characters having different histories in the show and another one in the comic			2
... you just really have to stay true to what we call the bible of the show and not deviate from that			2
as each year goes on there 's more stuff to stay on top of			2
@entity2 : the creatures are very interesting in the comic book series			1
ball : there is a new creature in the comic book that is different from any creature that we 've done on the show			1
but who 's to say what 's going to happen in the future			0
@entity2 : how hard was it to develop the picture for that ? ball : we actually knew what the creature was			2
but in terms of how it manifested physically and what powers it had to work with -- well , i sort of left that up to the artist			0
we knew that it was vicious , it was supernatural , it was not human , and it could do some real damage			0
and that sort of got incorporated into the writing of the script			0
@entity2 : are you influenced by the fans because many times these fans know stuff that even the " @entity9 " writers and publicists do n't know about			1
ball : it 's true , they are very hardcore			0
@entity2 : putting a comic book together , are you looking at some of those fan sites to see what people want or what they 're saying at all ? are you influenced by that ? ball : i 'm not			1
i personally do not go to those sites			0
i do n't read what people post			0
there are plenty of people in the writers room who do and communicate things to me			0
i just do n't have the time			0
and obviously i spend so many hours per day working on " @entity9 " that in my free time the last thing i want to do is have more " @entity9 " -- you know what i mean ? i tend to read or play with my dogs or go in the canyon or something like that , because i do n't want to go crazy			2
i want to maintain some reality			0
@entity2 : so you guys are unveiling the comic book at @entity29 this week			1
who 's going to be there ? what are we going to see at @entity29 ? ball : a lot of us are going to be there -- a lot of the cast			1
i know that @entity196 and @entity197 and @entity198 and @entity199 and @entity200 and @entity201 and @entity202 will be there			0
i think @entity204 is going to be there			0
i do n't think @entity206 is going to be there because he 's going to be shooting a movie			0
i 'm assuming it 'll be pretty much the same group , and we have a big panel discussion			0
we 're going to sign autographs and just sort of partake in the wackiness that is @entity29			2
@entity2 : how many comic books are in the first series ? and how many will be put out ? ball : we 're going to do six issues this year			1
i think there will be a new one every month			0
and then once all six issues are published , they will be bound in a special collector 's anthology edition			0
and i 'm assuming we 'll do it again next year if it works out well			0
@entity2 : so where do you hope to rank in the world of comic books ? ball : oh i do n't know , i 'm such a newbie			1
to use a " @entity9 " term , i 'm such a newbie to the world of comics that i 'm not really sure			2
i know the comic book is really good			1
it 's a really fun story			0
it 's all the characters that you know and love in a new situation fighting a new adversary			0
you also get some very interesting back story on all the characters , which is very true to who they are			0
i 'm very pleased with it			0
@entity2 : since it 's independent of the actual show , will you have new characters being introduced into future issues of the comic book series ? ball : there is a main story where one known character encounters this creature in a situation that they ca n't get out of , and each of them sort of shares a story from their past and that 's where we might meet some new people			1
we 'll see some people who may no longer exist on the show			0
@entity2 : okay so give us a sneak peak of upcoming episodes on season three			1
ball : very soon you 're going to find out something that is very important from @entity283 's past and that is going to motivate him and has been motivating him for years			0
that is a little bit of a big shocker .			0
