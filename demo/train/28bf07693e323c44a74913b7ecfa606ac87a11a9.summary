flying economy getting you down ? the good news is that getting bumped up to @entity3 just got more affordable			0
last month , @entity4 became the latest carrier to roll out an online auction scheme that allows customers to bid for seating upgrades			1
" everyone knows that if no one is sitting in seat 2a when the plane takes off from @entity14 to @entity15 , it 's a loss for the airline			1
but everyone in economy wants that seat , " explains @entity17 , the founder and ceo of @entity19 , the software company that developed the system			1
" the idea was to help correct that , and do it intelligently			0
" the setup works differently for each airline , depending on their specifications			1
some carriers offer upgrades to @entity33 as well			1
who is allowed to participate in the bidding process also varies			0
often , the selection process is determined by the route and the number of leftover premium seats			0
on occasion , a customer 's frequent flyer status might also come into play			0
furthermore , bidding is blind ; customers enter how much they 're willing to pay , and if that number exceeds other bids ( and the airlines keep that information top secret ) , they win			1
the cost of an upgrade is extremely variable , depending on the airline , season and route			1
carriers are shy to reveal how much is necessary in securing a winning bid , though it 's fair to say the price is less than a full - fare , business class ticket			1
the concept has gained traction with the airline community			1
a dozen carriers have already introduced upgrade auctions to their websites with the help of @entity19 and he expects to double that number before the year is out			1
still , one ca n't help but wonder if the airlines risk eating into their premium revenues			2
@entity71 , an airline analyst at @entity72 , says it 's a possibility			2

" as a result , airlines tend to control the capacity of award seats			2
there 's a certain amount of experimentation in the process that is required			0
" @entity17 , however , seems confident the bidding system will not impact premium - seating sales			0
" there 's no guarantee that simply because you 've requested an upgrade , you 'll receive it , " he says			2
" if you want to sit in @entity3 and your budget allows you to do so , you should buy that seat			0
it 's the only guarantee you wo n't be sitting in the back of the plane on your next trip across the ocean			0
" @entity103 has one of the more democratic approaches to the process			0
everyone , regardless of frequent flyer status , can bid on an upgrade , assuming any are available on the flight in question			1
the airline is n't worried about hurting their profits , because they view the full - fare seats and auction upgrades as two different products , even though passengers who win an upgrade receive the exact same benefits as someone who paid up front , including access to premium lounges and extra baggage allowances			1

" it 's not for the business traveler who really wants to fly @entity3 and needs a 100 % guarantee that he can			0
it 's for the passenger that just wants to treat himself for a little extra , and can live with the uncertainty			2
" while bidding for seats might not hurt an airline 's bottom line , the advent of these auctions will likely eat away at the number of free upgrades awarded passengers			2
" it probably will erode the complimentary upgrade process to a certain degree , and airlines do run the risk of offending their elite traveler , who has become accustomed to complimentary upgrades , " says @entity71			1
@entity17 , however , argues that free bump - ups are the stuff of fantasy			0
" free upgrades are really only given by necessity in operational situations or given to frequent flyers , " he says			0
" the idea that you can simply smile at a ticket agent and get gifted a free upgrade is a romantic notion			2
it simply does n't happen			0

many airlines offer passenger chance to ' blind bid ' for an upgrade
@entity4 is the latest airline to offer customers the chance via an online auction .
@entity181 , the company that developed the software , has already *signed* on a dozen carriers .
