-- in his first in - depth tv interview since his dramatic escape from house arrest , @entity2 human rights activist @entity1 told @entity0 about his departure from @entity2 and his continuing concern for family and friends he left behind			1
he also spoke about tasting freedom recently			0
" i have n't been able to feel ( nature ) for a long time , " said @entity1 , who is blind			2
" i had some time to soak in the sun and feel the breeze			0
i just felt i had n't been able to do that in so long			0
i have missed out for too long			0
" @entity1 's brother fled village to seek legal advice , lawyer says asked about speaking out against @entity2 , he said , " it was natural for me , it was very natural for me			1
i feel it 's in people 's nature to want to stop evil and embrace the good			2
" his experience being under house arrest in @entity2 , he said , brought much suffering			1
" i want to correct one thing here , " @entity1 said			2
in the future , he continued , " let 's not use the word ' house arrest , ' but instead let 's use the term ' illegal detention			1
' it 's hard for me to describe what it was like during that time			2
but let 's just say that my suffering was beyond imagination			2
" he made his comments thursday morning in an exclusive with @entity0 's @entity46			2
@entity1 's arrival in the @entity48 on saturday brought an end to a diplomatic firestorm between @entity51 and @entity52 that erupted after he escaped from house arrest in the @entity55 province			1
@entity1 , 40 , and his wife and children are in the @entity48 for @entity1 to study at @entity58 under a fellowship			1
@entity1 told @entity0 that he and his wife were beaten periodically in @entity2			1
" yes , it was beyond everybody 's imagination , " @entity1 said			1
" but i do n't want to talk about it right now			0
" five days after arriving in the @entity48 , @entity1 said he was still gathering his thoughts about his escape			1
" after evading danger and the obstacles , i was able to get out of @entity69 ( his home town ) and then i called my good friend @entity72 in @entity51			0
" he quickly led a team to find me and drove me to @entity51			0
i was able to talk extensively with him during the journey and found out what had been going on in the outside world			0
so mr. @entity72 played a very important role in this process , " @entity1 said			2
though staying in a safe place in @entity51 , he began to worry about his safety , he said			0
he was also getting treatment for a foot injury , he said			0
he came up with a safer place to stay , he said			0
he noted how acquaintances in @entity2 helped him			2
" there 's one thing i want to mention that may be a surprise to many people , " @entity1 said			1
" when a group of people come together and accomplish something , they often fight for credit			0
in my case , all those people who went to @entity55 to pick me up , when the news broke , they were fighting for risk instead of credit			0
they were all trying to claim responsibility to make others safer			0
" @entity1 , who 's blind , fears the @entity2 government may retaliate against acquaintances who helped him , he said			1
" of course , i 'm very worried			0
we can see their retribution against my family since my escape has continued and been intensified , " @entity1 said			2
shortly after @entity1 escaped from his village , his nephew , @entity110 , was arrested and accused of murder			1
@entity110 's father , who 's @entity1 's brother , has fled his village in eastern @entity2 to @entity51 to seek legal advice , his lawyer said thursday			1
" when dozens of men break into someone 's house with weapons in the middle of the night , taking away your parent with a hood over his head and detain him without any legal basis and then go back to assault my nephew , he only reacted when he could no longer bear the beatings , and his actions would be self defense according to any @entity2 law , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" they injured his head , and made him bleed for three hours , and his clothes were shattered and the sticks they used to beat him were bent , and if actions under such circumstances ( were ) not called self - defense , would there be any meaning left in having the term self - defense in @entity2 law ? " @entity1 added			1
@entity1 asserted that the @entity2 government seeks to convict his nephew under an unfair legal process			1
" what they 're doing now is not very different than what they did to me in 2006 , " @entity1 said			2
" they told my nephew no lawyers are willing to defend you			0
then they tell lawyers outside ( that ) @entity110 has already hired lawyers			0
i experienced the same thing in 2006			0
back then i told them clearly i have my own lawyers			0
i do n't need you to appoint lawyers for me			0
but they forced ... a government - appointed lawyer onto me despite my protest			0
" in 2006 , @entity1 was sentenced by a local @entity2 court to four years and three months in prison on charges of damaging property and " organizing a mob to disturb traffic " in a protest , charges that his supporters called preposterous			1
@entity1 rose to fame in the late 1990s because of his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices , such as alleged forced abortions , by @entity2 's family planning officials			1
read about a report finding brutal methods by city enforcers after he was released from prison in september 2010 , he had been confined to his home along with his wife , mother and daughter			0
regarding his 2006 trial , @entity1 told @entity0 : " that whole process was just a farce of them investigating , prosecuting , trying and convicting all by themselves			2
" to ensure his nephew receives a fair trial , his case should be assigned to a court outside of @entity55 , @entity1 said			1
" @entity110 's case should be moved elsewhere , so he can have a fair trial and have his innocence and freedom back , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity2 's own criminal procedure law means @entity202 authorities can not be involved in @entity110 's case			1
" the case " is going to be a benchmark in testing @entity2 's rule of law			1
it 's going to be a litmus test , " @entity1 continued , " because in his case , what happened was not difficult to verify			1
the key is whether or not they want to act based on facts and accordance with law			0
" on saturday , the activist indicated through a translator that the @entity48 government granted him partial citizenship rights			1
he asked people to work with him to " promote justice and fairness in @entity2			2
" and @entity1 said he was looking forward to recuperating in " body and spirit			2
" @entity0 's @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report			0
