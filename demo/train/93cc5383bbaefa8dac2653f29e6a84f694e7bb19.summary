a federal jury in @entity1 on monday found radical @entity3 cleric @entity2 guilty of charges that he aided terrorists in incidents that span the globe , from a remote @entity9 ranch to the dusty desert of the @entity11			1
@entity2 faced 11 criminal counts for allegedly aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage - taking in @entity14 ; sending a young recruit to jihadists in @entity17 ; violating @entity19 sanctions against the @entity20 ; and attempting to establish an @entity22 - style training camp on the @entity23 of the @entity19			1
the jury deliberated for more than 12 hours over two days			0
@entity25 was found guilty on all counts , and showed no discernible reaction as the verdict was read			0
" the defendant stands convicted , not for what he said , but for what he did , " said @entity30 @entity19 attorney @entity29 , describing @entity2 as " not just a preacher of faith , but a trainer of terrorists			1
" once again our civilian system of justice has proven itself up to the task of trying an accused terrorist and arriving at a fair and just and swift result			0
" the high - profile @entity45 mosque leader gained notoriety for the metal hook he 's sometimes depicted wearing in place of one of his missing hands , but he sported only an occasional writing prosthesis in the @entity30 courtroom			0
contrary to stories that he lost the limbs in battle , @entity2 testified , his maiming was the result of an engineering accident			1
the government 's three - week case against @entity2 was an effort to connect the dots between the defendant and events thousands of miles away , through key witnesses who often had never met the cleric themselves and testified in exchange for leniency or protection			1
a trial highlight was @entity2 taking the stand in his own defense and accusing federal prosecutors of using " pay - as - you - go witnesses " and a " cut - and - paste " approach to take inflammatory comments out context , including statements about his admiration for late @entity22 leader @entity79			1
" the deliberations confirmed our fears they would focus on words and ideas rather than the evidence , " said defense attorney @entity83 , after the verdict was announced			0
the speed of deliberations , he said , make it clear jurors " walked in with a foregone conclusion			0
" defendant claims he was a ' mouthpiece ' during his four days of testimony , @entity2 described @entity79 as a dangerous hothead in charge of an unfocused organization that has betrayed the @entity17 people			1
as for the @entity20 regime , it does n't need his money ; it has " millions , " yet does n't feed its own people , he said			2
but in @entity30 , by invoking 9/11 and @entity79 's name , @entity2 mused , " you can convict a person of killing the @entity110			1
" the 56 - year - old cleric denied any part in the bumbling effort to launch a jihad training camp in @entity9 and said he 'd acted only as a " mouthpiece " in the fight against the @entity14 government when the hostage drama played out			1
during his closing argument , @entity83 warned jurors not to be distracted by the " quantity of irrelevant evidence " the prosecution presented , including photographs of @entity79 found on computers in the defendant 's @entity45 home and snippets of his videotaped orations			2
@entity25 was convicted in the @entity130 of inciting racial hatred and soliciting murder with his fiery sermons , but the charges against him in the @entity19 are not for hateful speech or possessing photographs or other materials			2
prosecution : @entity25 could ' work a crowd ' the prosecution played video clips of @entity142 endorsing suicide missions and saying the killing of non-believers is permissible , comparing them to cows or pigs			0
prosecution exhibits also included the 10 - volume " @entity149 " recovered from the @entity2 family residence , with topics ranging from bomb - making to personal hygiene in the battlefield			1
" it 's a very slippery slope to use someone 's library against them , " @entity83 said in his closing			0
the attorney conceded that his client sent money to benefit destitute widows and a secret girl 's school in a @entity20 - controlled territory , prohibited under @entity19 sanctions -- the final charge of the 11 - count indictment against @entity2 , with a maximum penalty of five years in prison			1
in the closing argument for the government , @entity172 told jurors the tapes and photographs reveal " the real @entity2 " : a screaming hatemonger -- far from the calm , tolerant , and sometimes quite funny man they 'd seen on the witness stand			1
" he knows how to work a crowd , " said @entity172			0
key witness has checkered past as for the quality of the government witnesses , @entity172 said prosecutors did n't choose the co-conspirators , and that criminal trials involve unsavory characters			0
a pivotal witness for the prosecution was @entity193 , a @entity194 man who testified he conceived of the idea for the @entity9 training camp and faxed a pitch letter to @entity2			1
" it looks just like @entity17 , " the letter reads and repeatedly points out that all planned activities would be legal in the " pro-gun , " " pro-militia " state			0
two men were sent from @entity45 by @entity2 to train recruits , said @entity193 , but the pair left after realizing his claims of eager trainees , weapons stockpiles , and efforts to build housing and a mosque were lies			2
only two run - down trailers sat atop the barren ranch land , and its sole training facility was a deer - shaped target in a dry creek bed			0
@entity25 claimed the men made their way to @entity9 on their own , after fishing @entity193 's fax from his trash can ; he himself considered the pitch " a hallucination , " he testified			1
@entity193 also testified he agreed to escort a young recruit to an @entity17 front - line commander for @entity2 , but said he actually left his young charge stranded and alone in a @entity229 hotel			1
@entity193 is on his second cooperation agreement with the government , having violated his first one by fleeing to @entity233			0
he spent approximately six years in jail for his own role in the @entity9 venture and testified that he continues to receive a monthly stipend from the government for living expenses			2
he also admitted a range of past criminal endeavors , including peddling knockoff watches and pirate cds , and setting up an airport bathroom rendezvous to sell a computer without paying @entity130 sales tax			0
another witness against @entity2 , @entity247 , testified that he later saw the abandoned recruit at the infamous @entity250 training camp -- a key point to the allegation @entity2 in fact aided terrorists in @entity17			1
a trainee himself at the time , @entity247 has admitted he conspired with failed shoe bomber @entity258 on a plot to take down airliners , and , in fact , received shoe bombs from alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity263			0
@entity247 backed out , he testified , after reconnecting with his parents			0
as part of a cooperation agreement in the @entity130 , @entity247 saw his own potential sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole dwindle and ultimately served approximately six years , he said			0
@entity247 testified via teleconference from @entity45 to avoid facing pending charges in the @entity19			2
@entity274 recruit a courtroom no - show a glaring absence on the witness stand was the young recruit himself , @entity281 - born computer student @entity279			2
he was apprehended in @entity17 as part of a roundup by @entity19 forces in 2002 , according to testimony			2
jurors were not told @entity279 was released without charges after spending about two years at the detention facility in @entity289 , @entity290			0
now living in the @entity130 , @entity279 declined to testify in @entity2 's case , according to defense attorneys			2
the most unassailable of key prosecution witnesses was @entity294 , who was taken hostage with her fellow travelers during a trip through @entity14 in 1998 , allegedly as leverage for prisoners held by the @entity14 government -- including @entity2 's own stepson			1
four of the tourists were killed during a harrowing shootout with government forces , @entity302 testified			0
@entity302 later traveled to @entity45 to confront @entity2 ; the cleric agreed to let her record the conversation			2
on the tape , which was played for jurors in court , @entity2 falls short of confessing he knew of the kidnapping plan ahead of time , but uses a phrase prosecutors have said is devastating evidence of his involvement : " we never thought it would be that bad			0
" the two criminal counts relating to the @entity14 kidnapping plot both carry a possible life sentence			1
sentencing is set for september 9 .			1
