@entity0 -- if she had been at the scene of the crime , forensic evidence would prove her guilt , but @entity7 says there is nothing -- no dna , no hair , no footprints , no handprints -- to show she was there			1
@entity17 spoke in an exclusive interview with @entity1 on thursday , two days after an @entity16 court released an explanation of her conviction			1
in a retrial , @entity17 and @entity21 , her then - boyfriend , were found guilty in the 2007 death of @entity25 , @entity17 's onetime roommate			1
" i did not kill my friend			0
i did not wield a knife			0
i had no reason to , " @entity17 said			1
" in the month that we that we were living together , we were becoming friends			0
a week before the murder occurred , we went out to a classical music concert together ... we had never fought			2
" @entity17 struggled to speak at moments in the interview , seemingly overcome by emotion and thoughts of @entity39			1
but , for the most part , she was calm , collected and methodical in how she broke down arguments in the case			2
in its more than 300 - page document , the @entity45 appeals court said a third person convicted in the murder , @entity25 , did not act alone , and cited the nature of the victim 's wounds			1
ruling judge @entity51 , who presided over the second appeal in the case , said @entity39 and @entity17 disagreed over the payment of the rent in the house they shared in @entity58 and that " there was an argument then an elevation and progression of aggression			1
" @entity17 dismissed those allegations out of hand			1
" if i were there , i would have traces of @entity25 's broken body on me			2
and i would have left traces of myself around -- around @entity25 's corpse , " she said			2
" and i -- i am not there			2
and that proves my innocence			0
" ' i 'm not that person ' when asked what type of person @entity77 must think she is , @entity17 cited his report			2
" he believes the prosecutor when the prosecutor describes me as a person who was capable of not only completely disturbing everyone around me , but then getting drugged up , " she said , trailing off			0
" but i 'm not that person			0
and the evidence does n't show that			0
" she said she has been haunted by how people perceived her behavior in the immediate aftermath of the murder			2
@entity17 was filmed kissing @entity21 outside the murder scene			1
at the police station , she reportedly sat on @entity21 's lap , making faces			2
she told @entity39 's friends she must have suffered			0
" i think it 's true that people seemed to have had a kind of tunnel vision in my regard and that has been something that i 've been having to fight against for a long time , " @entity17 said			1
the @entity45 court in january said that @entity17 , who also was convicted of slander , was sentenced in absentia to 28 1/2 years in prison			1
@entity21 's sentence was 25 years			0
they were first convicted of murder in 2009 , but those verdicts were overturned on appeal in 2011			1
@entity111 , the judge who tossed their convictions , has lashed out at colleagues			0
" the @entity115 has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only considered facts and evidence			0
there is no evidence to condemn @entity17 and @entity21 , " said the judge in a scathing statement obtained by @entity1			1
" it 's a verdict that , seems to me , is the result of fantasy and has nothing to do with evidence			0
" @entity129 is the only person in jail for the slaying , and many aspects of the crime remain unexplained			0
' it 's not a complex case ' @entity17 's conviction has raised questions about her possible extradition to @entity16 to serve her sentence , since she was in the @entity141 and did not attend the retrial			1
she gets one more appeal -- to @entity16 's highest court			1
she said she thought the @entity45 appeals court would find her innocent , and was caught by surprise when it did n't			0
" as this case has progressed , the evidence that the prosecution has claimed exists against me has been proven less and less and less			0
and all that has happened is that they 've filled these holes with speculation , " she said			1
separately , @entity17 added : " what i keep seeing in this case is trying to put an artificial complexity to it			1
it 's not a complex case			2
" if @entity16 's highest court affirms her conviction , the country could ask for her to be sent back to @entity16 , where she spent four years in prison awaiting and during her first trial			1
@entity141 authorities would then have to decide whether to extradite			0
@entity17 said she is hopeful such a scenario can be avoided and that her next appeal will be successful			1
she is optimistic her life in limbo will finally be resolved			0
" from this whole experience , especially in prison where you have to take everything day by day , right now i 'm having to take everything step by step			0
and if i think about everything that i could possibly be facing , it 's way too overwhelming for me to even conceive , " @entity17 said			1
" i truly believe that it is possible to win this , and to bring an end to all of the speculation and the nonsensical theories , and really bring peace to everyone who has suffered			2
" @entity187 reported this story in @entity0			0
@entity189 reported and wrote this story in @entity190 .			0

" i truly believe that it is possible to win this , " @entity7 tells @entity1
she has one final appeal -- to @entity16 's highest court
@entity17 says holes in her case have been filled with speculation
