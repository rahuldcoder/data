while the administration adamantly reassures @entity13 that it wo n't put @entity13 boots on the ground , it also has made a compelling case for going after the @entity19 threat			1
signs of genocide @entity10 and the @entity29 talk of potential genocide and crimes against humanity if @entity19 fighters slaughter minority groups fleeing them in the north			1
in particular , tens of thousands of @entity36 , a religious minority in the north , have fled into mountains where they lack food and services and remain vulnerable to the @entity19 rampage			0
" convert to @entity6 or die " is the @entity19 ultimatum , as given to @entity45 when the group overran that minority 's largest city , @entity49			0
a senior @entity13 administration said @entity19 backs up its threat by beheading people with differing religious convictions and putting the heads on spikes to terrorize others			1
the extremists have also uploaded execution videos to the @entity59			0
the militants ' carnage has displaced hundreds of thousands of people , especially from @entity8 's second - largest city , @entity64			0
in addition , thousands of @entity36 families are stranded , and two @entity13 military cargo planes airdropped 5,300 gallons of water and 8,000 meals to them thursday			2
@entity13 secretary of state @entity70 warned that @entity19 ' " grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide			2
protect @entity13 interests and personnel " we do whatever is necessary to protect our people , " @entity10 said thursday night in announcing his authorization of airstrikes			1
" we support our allies when they 're in danger			0
" those two principles sum up the reasons for what he did			0
there are hundreds of military personnel in @entity8 , many of them advisers sent to work with @entity8 and @entity93 military officials in response to the @entity19 threat			1
dozens of them are in @entity98 , the largest city of the @entity93 region , which has been one of the most stable regions in @entity8 and a cooperative @entity13 partner			1
@entity13 consular staff are there with them			2
friday 's initial airstrikes hit @entity19 artillery outside @entity98 , according to the @entity106			1

they have wrested @entity93 towns from the @entity109			0
take on the extremists @entity10 continues pushing for a political solution in @entity8 , saying @entity13 military action ca n't solve the conflict			1
but when asked why the @entity13 was not evacuating @entity13 personnel , a senior administration official said the @entity13 has the wherewithal to protect them and prefers instead to " lay down a marker " before @entity19			1

" @entity134 " was the dictum from @entity130 sens. @entity129 of @entity131 and @entity132 of @entity133			0
