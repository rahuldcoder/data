later this week and next , she 'll have the unenviable task of visiting @entity4 and @entity5 at a time when @entity8 's capacity to influence the policies of both countries has fallen to new lows			1
and not even the secretary of state -- a veritable superstar of persuasion -- can charm @entity8 back into a position of influence			1
the public aspect of the visits should go smoothly enough			0
nobody has a stake in upsetting an @entity8 secretary of state			2
. election year politics will diminish any unpleasantness in @entity5 , and even in @entity4 , where the secretary should deliver some tough messages on the need to create and respect democratic principles , nobody really wants a fight			1
but not so far beneath the surface , agendas diverge and challenges abound for an @entity8 that 's no longer as admired , feared or respected as much as it needs to be in a region critical to its national interests			2
here 's a guide to some of them : democratization : in @entity4 , @entity41 confronts so many challenges and minefields that regardless of what happens on this visit , the @entity8 will be wrestling with that country 's politics for years to come			1
the good news , of course , is that for the first time in 40 years , @entity4 has competitive politics ; the bad news is that the most anti-democratic and exclusive forces in the country are the ones who are competing			2
@entity41 will find herself sandwiched between @entity58 she does n't trust and whose values are n't her own , and generals she believes have subverted @entity4 's nascent democracy but are necessary to maintaining the peace treaty with @entity5			1
navigating this course wo n't be easy			0
the meeting with @entity4 's president @entity65 will carry great symbolism : the @entity8 sanctioning the rise of political islam in the @entity71 world 's most important country			1
although @entity41 can rationalize she is meeting the democratically elected president of @entity4 , @entity65 is a member of the @entity74 , whose views on issues such as female genital mutilation , women 's rights , peace with @entity5 and @entity8 policies throughout the region diverge from hers , and @entity8 's			1
the meeting with the generals wo n't be much easier			0
the @entity86 administration believes that the military -- not the @entity74 -- has been mainly responsible for subverting the democratic process , and yet it 's really hard - pressed to do much about it			0
the $ 1.5 billion in military aid from the @entity8 will most likely continue , lest @entity8 be without any leverage to affect matters in @entity4			2
the @entity5 will press hard to ensure that assistance continues			0
after all , the @entity8 gave it to the authoritarian @entity96 regime ; can it really withhold it in a period when @entity4 is supposedly democratizing ? the generals have concluded that we need @entity4 now more than @entity4 needs us			1
peace process : @entity41 's lack of leverage in @entity4 will be mirrored in @entity5			1
@entity5 's focus on domestic issues such as the military conscription law and election politics in the @entity8 will ensure that the @entity86 administration will not seriously push the revival of @entity5 - @entity110 negotiations			1
even if talks were to resume , they would n't produce much			0
@entity5 prime minister @entity113 , worried about @entity4 and @entity114 , is n't prepared to make big decisions			1
and neither , for that matter , is a weak and constrained @entity118 chairman @entity117			0
@entity114 : @entity5 's worst fears about a nuclear @entity114 appear to be coming to pass			1
sanctions are tougher than ever but apparently wo n't deter @entity114 should it persist in its campaign to acquire the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon			0
the @entity124 ( @entity8 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 ) negotiations with @entity114 are n't producing a solution that stops weapons grade enrichment			2
the @entity114 centrifuges continue to spin			0
and the @entity8 are in no mood to strike @entity114 or to give the @entity5 a green or yellow light to strike			1
no @entity5 military strike is likely before year 's end , certainly not before the @entity8 elections			2
but after that , all bets are off			0
neither @entity41 nor the president would be able to restrain the @entity5 should they decide they need to act			2
@entity146 , visits by secretaries of state to these countries really mattered			0
the @entity147 has gotten a lot more complicated , and the locals act increasingly without reference to what @entity8 thinks or does			0
it may not be pretty to watch , but we better get used to it			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

@entity159 : secretary of state to visit @entity4 and @entity5 as @entity8 clout in those nations wanes
in @entity4 , @entity41 will be stuck between islamists and anti-democracy generals , he writes
@entity157 : in @entity5 , domestic issues and @entity114 are bigger issues than @entity8 's concerns
@entity157 : the @entity8 ca n't stop @entity5 if it plans to attack @entity114 nor influence @entity4 's politics
