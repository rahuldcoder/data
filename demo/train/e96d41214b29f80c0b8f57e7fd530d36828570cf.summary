-- @entity1 's monday started with protesters , ended with protesters , and was punctuated with pressure from president @entity5 in between			1
the chairman of the @entity7 tried to leave his house in the morning , but his driveway was blocked by a small group of demonstrators who urged him to adopt tighter net neutrality rules			1
at first @entity1 tried to play along by helping them hold up a sign that blares " save the @entity16			1
" " i 'm on your side , " he argued , saying he also believes in an open internet			0
but he could hardly get in a word in , as the protestors , affiliated with the group @entity22 , chanted and sang songs outside his house			0
both sides claim they want a free and open @entity16 , but they disagree on just how to make that happen			0
the protesters want tighter regulations to ensure none of the major internet providers get better access to websites and services than smaller competitors			0
such access , also known as " fast lanes , " has been supported by @entity1 in the past			1
" i think you 've all made your points			0
can i get out of my driveway now ? " @entity1 asked , saying that they were now violating his rights			1
" it 's the only moral choice we have , " one of the protesters replied			0
@entity1 was more than familiar with the group			1
they had staged multiple protests earlier in the year outside of the @entity7 , including an event that they billed as a musical			2
after about five minutes monday , @entity1 is seen stepping around the demonstrators , abandoning his car and seemingly heading to work by foot			2
@entity54 , a @entity55 reporter , tweeted that @entity1 took the metro			2
@entity1 's office did not immediately return a request for comment about the group			2
later monday morning , in a surprise announcement , @entity5 made clear his own proposals for net neutrality , agreeing that there should n't be any fast lanes and calling for stricter regulations to keep things equal			1
@entity1 , in a written statement , said @entity5 's plan was a " welcome and important addition			1
" encouraged by the president 's proposals , the protesters returned to @entity1 's home monday night			1
but this time the mood was a bit lighter			0
@entity77 , organizer with @entity22 , told @entity0 that they " decided to change the tone a little bit			0
" they gave @entity1 's wife a bottle of wine , and politely urged the chairman to be their " internet hero " by adopting the president 's proposals			1
he was n't quite as eager to engage with the protesters as he was in the morning , but things still remained cordial			0
flowers said she was surprised the police were n't called			0
after @entity1 went inside , there was more singing			2
the group plans to hold another event thursday night by the @entity7 , @entity77 said			2
perhaps " some sort of dance party , something more festive			0

net neutrality protesters showed up at the home of @entity7 chairman @entity1
they came the same day as president @entity5 made an announcement on the issue
