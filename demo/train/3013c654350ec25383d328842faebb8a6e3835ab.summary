-- despite all the political tension in @entity3 , it 's nice to know things are still safe enough at the zoo for a zebra to get it on with a donkey			1
because , really , in some weird , small way , it 's a symbol of hope			2
except , in this case , it 's a zebra ... getting it on with a donkey			1
but as odd as it may sound , things ( ahem ) worked out , and now we have an adorable new reminder of what can happen when we put aside our differences for the shared goal of peace and love			2
that living , breathing reminder is a beautiful baby " zonkey " named @entity30 , who recently came into the world at the @entity33 near @entity3 's main city , @entity35			1
of course , a zonkey is just what it sounds like			1
possibly even part lion depending on what kind of shenanigans were going on inside the stall			2
( and if you accept my rather misguided understanding of how conception works			2
) but one thing that 's perfectly clear is that this little guy is ridiculously cute			2
and everyone is talking about him			2
so , it sort of makes sense that @entity30 was named for a local newspaper , honoring the publication 's fifth anniversary			1
@entity57 , when you think about it , that may or may not be a compliment to the publication			2
we named an ass after you			1
" either way , @entity30 is just lucky to be alive			1
although cross-breeding of equines is not unheard of , it is rather rare and unconventional			2
and proper zoos are n't overly keen on the idea			2
photos : zonkeys and ligers and pizzles but this facility says that toying with nature was never a part of the plan			0
you see , @entity30 's mother -- the zebra -- was uncomfortable in her enclosure and had been without a mate for quite a while			1
presumably , she spent most of her time being bitter with the other single girls in book club			0
eventually , the zoo moved the lonely zebra into a different part of the complex where she could be surrounded by other hoofed animals			1
this included her dream donkey			1
mind you , it 's also possible that she was simply desperate and the donkey was drunk			1
" i like your stripes			0
" " what ? " " i said i like your stripes ! " no matter how it all went down , we 're all thankful			0
because now we have this silly looking thing with a brown upper body and zebra legs			1
and visitors to the zoo are absolutely loving him			1
of course , to be fair , all baby animals tend to be a big draw			1
especially when you look like you 've been pieced together with spare parts			0
an adorable baby polar bear with a tortoise shell would pretty much stop the world from spinning			1
@entity120 would be cheering from his grave			0
and scientists might go crazy trying to figure out just how the hell that actually happened			0
@entity124 would finally own up to it			0
" i 'm sorry ! i was bored			0
" but , no matter the species , whenever you get a cute baby cross-breed , you sort of have to enjoy it while you can			1
generally speaking , hybrid animals do n't reproduce			0
they tend to be infertile			0
( it 's a science thing			0
i do n't quite get it			0
mr. @entity136 tried to teach me in high school , but i was far more interested in depriving others of their education			0
) that said , being infertile might not be such a bad thing if , say , you 're a rather confident liger and you do well at the clubs			0
child support ai n't cheap			0
@entity144 on ! anyway , that 's the story of a cute little zonkey who is currently enjoying his 15 minutes of worldwide @entity149 fame			1
@entity30 , we like your stripes			1
" what ? " we like your stripes ! follow @ @entity154 on @entity155			0
