@entity0 -- the inspector general who reported @entity4 targeting of conservative groups said thursday that he did n't have information until last week that the word " progressive " also was on a list of criteria for extra scrutiny of tax - exempt applications			1
at a hearing of the @entity13 , treasury inspector general for tax administration j. @entity14 said the information that liberal groups also were probably targeted only came to him july 9			1
his audit , released in may , cited criteria including " tea party " and other conservative - themed words or labels that were used to decide whether applicants for tax - exempt status should come under further review			0
since then , an investigation by the panel turned up documents that showed @entity4 workers also were told to look for the liberal - themed label			0
" they were not provided during our audit , even though similar documents that list quote ' tea party ' unquote but not ' progressive ' were , " @entity14 said			0
" i am very disturbed that these documents were not provided to our auditors at the outset , and we are currently reviewing this issue			0
" the @entity4 targeting revealed by @entity14 's audit in may led to accusations by @entity42 that the @entity44 administration could be using the tax agency 's powers against political enemies			1
@entity48 have rejected such allegations and insisted that liberal groups also were targeted			1
last week , the top @entity51 on the @entity52 questioned why @entity14 's audit had not included information on liberal groups being targeted			2
thursday 's hearing was the first time @entity14 issued a public response to the criticism by rep. @entity59 of @entity60			1
" we just learned recently that name was being used by the @entity4 , " @entity14 said of the term " progressive			0
" @entity14 's audit indicated that lax oversight at the @entity4 allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups starting in 2010 and continuing until last year			0
in particular , the report said @entity4 workers in the tax - exempt unit used " @entity70 " or bolo lists of words such as " tea party " to assess what applicants came under extra scrutiny that delayed decisions for months and even years			0
however , it also said no evidence existed that the targeting was politically motivated			0
@entity14 subsequently testified at previous hearings that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted			2
however , @entity59 said information made public last week showed that @entity14 , who was appointed in 2004 by @entity42 president @entity85 , was aware that liberal groups also were targeted			1
on thursday , @entity14 and other officials in the inspector general 's office said the audit focused on the bolo list that included conservtive labels			1
@entity14 expressed frustration over how the issue has unfolded , at one point saying : " this is not a clean - cut matter			0
there 's a lot going on here			0
" earlier at thursday 's hearing , two career @entity4 employees shot down the central premise of committee chairman rep. @entity104 's argument that the agency 's targeting scandal was politically motivated			1
asked repeatedly whether they knew of anyone at the @entity4 with political motives to obstruct applications for tax - exempt status by conservative groups , the pair told the panel " no. " @entity104 himself asked the question early on in the committee 's third hearing on the issue , as did others from both parties amid bitter exchanges that focused attention on the political squabbling instead of the targeting cited by @entity14 's report			1
@entity59 challenged @entity104 on past comments suggesting that @entity129 involvement in the targeting showed it was a weapon against political enemies of president @entity44			1
" this is unsubstantiated nonsense , " @entity59 said , adding that it undermined the integrity of the committee			0
for his part , @entity104 insisted that the testimony from @entity4 veterans @entity138 and @entity140 established that @entity4 officials in @entity0 played a major role in the targeting			1
the problem was broader than the earlier claim by @entity48 that it was limited to the agency 's @entity147 office that handles tax - exempt applications , @entity104 said			2
" we can today debunk the accusation that @entity147 was , in fact , the story and that it never went to @entity0 , which it clearly did , " the @entity150 @entity42 said			0
however , his case was deflated by the unwavering insistence by @entity157 and @entity140 that they were unaware of any political motivation in the targeting or any influence from outside the @entity4 on extra scrutiny that delayed responses to applications			2
the hearing followed a series of accusatory memos and news releases by both sides as the @entity4 targeting issue descended further into a purely partisan spitting match			1
@entity104 sent the @entity4 a letter wednesday that made new demands for all communications on the matter between the tax agency , the @entity172 and @entity44 's office since february 2010			2
the letter , signed by @entity104 and other @entity180 , quoted excerpts of an interview with @entity140 that said the office of the @entity4 chief counsel -- who was appointed by @entity44 in 2009 -- played a role in scrutiny that delayed processing tax - exempt applications from some conservative groups			1
" its involvement and demands for information about political activity during the 2010 election cycle appears to have caused systematic delays in the processing of tea party applications , " the @entity42 letter said			0
in response , @entity59 issued his own letter that accused @entity104 of dishonest intentions			2
@entity4 interviews show no political bias , democrats say " rather than describing the whole truth , your letter appears yet again to create a skewed account based on partial , incomplete , and cherry - picked information while disregarding key evidence that contradicts your political narrative , " @entity59 wrote			2
a day earlier , @entity59 released a memo that cited excerpts from committee interviews with 15 @entity4 workers that found no evidence of political bias or @entity129 manipulation alleged by @entity42			1
" despite an extremely aggressive investigation involving thousands of documents and more than a dozen interviews of @entity4 employees , the overwhelming evidence before the committee reveals no political motivation or @entity129 involvement in this process , " said the memo written by the committee 's @entity48 staff			1
@entity104 conceded in an opinion piece published wednesday on the @entity233 website that the two - month investigation has yet to find hard evidence of involvement in the targeting by anyone outside the @entity4			2
he argued that the lack of proof does not mean the investigation should end			0
" we candidly still do n't have clear answers to many important questions and have yet to begin interviewing senior @entity4 officials , " @entity104 wrote , saying " judgment should be withheld until all relevant witnesses are interviewed and all documents reviewed			2
" dems highlight @entity4 targeting of other groups in an editorial thursday , @entity233 questioned the value of the ongoing investigation			1
" no political operatives from the @entity44 campaign or the @entity129 have been linked to any of the @entity4 ' activities , " the editorial said			2
" what 's more , it has become increasingly clear that confusion on the part of @entity4 employees , rather than a starkly political motive , was the primary cause of the delays			0
" at times during thursday 's hearing , @entity104 took a conciliatory stance , saying that any evidence of targeting -- whether of liberal or conservative groups -- should be investigated			2
" if the facts are that people got abused for myriad reasons , we ought to know it , " @entity104 said			0
both @entity104 and @entity59 asked @entity14 to provide more information on groups targeted by the @entity4 , and the inspector general pledged to do so			1
@entity59 and other @entity48 took aim thursday at past statements by @entity104 and other @entity42 , calling them blatantly political accusations with no basis in fact that went against the spirit of @entity104 's call at the start of thursday 's hearing to " reject , categorically , assumptions for which there is not evidence			1
" rep. @entity287 , a @entity288 @entity51 , called for @entity104 to retract his earlier comments that the targeting involved only conservative groups and was an effort to target @entity44 's political enemies			1
@entity104 responded that tea party groups that came under extra scrutiny could be considered political enemies of the president and that he had yet to see hard evidence that liberal groups were targeted			1
conservative group takes @entity4 , top @entity44 officials to court republicans made a point thursday of singling out @entity129 spokesman @entity304 for criticism , noting he previously said that the targeting involved rogue @entity4 employees in @entity147			2
@entity138 described herself as offended by the characterization of the issue as misdeeds at her level			0
she and @entity140 said the delays in rendering final decisions on applications by conservative groups was because of a lack of guidance from superiors in @entity0			0
under tax law and @entity4 regulations , groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax - exempt status			0
the targeting occurred after the 2010 ruling by the @entity325 that opened the political process to more private contributions from business and labor , leading to increased applications for tax - exempt status from groups involved in political activity			0
in the memo @entity59 made public tuesday , @entity4 employees who identified themselves as @entity42 , @entity48 and independents said there was no political motivation or outside influence involved in the agency 's handling of tax - exempt requests from groups with possible or likely political affiliations			1
according to the memo , an @entity4 tax law specialist based in @entity0 who described herself as @entity42 said " no , not at all " when asked whether there was any evidence that the agency targeted @entity44 's political enemies			0
" that 's kind of laughable that people think that , " the memo quoted the woman as saying			0
@entity59 and other @entity48 complained thursday that the other @entity4 employees who had been interviewed were not called as witnesses to the latest hearing			1
