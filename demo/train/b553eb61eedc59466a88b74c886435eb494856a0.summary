he was shot after a police unit that deals with gun crime stopped a cab carrying the 29 - year - old father of four			2
riots and looting spread across @entity0 and other cities , at a huge cost to local businesses and communities			1
@entity0 's @entity56 said saturday they had charged a man with handling stolen goods after recovering electrical products worth Â£ 40,000 ( $ 65,000 ) in @entity40			1
street gangs are " at the heart of all the violence , " @entity11 told an emergency parliament session thursday , citing evidence of their ties to police attacks and looting			1
@entity11 said he had asked senior government ministers to work " on a cross-government program of action to deal with this gang culture " to report back to @entity72 in october			0
" i also believe we should be looking beyond our shores to learn the lessons from others who have faced similar problems , " he said			2
" that is why i will be discussing how we can go further in getting to grips with gangs with people like @entity9			1
" @entity11 's @entity83 office said he had spoken to @entity9 friday after the former police chief agreed to take part in a series of meetings on tackling gangs in the fall			1
" @entity9 , who has long - standing links with @entity6 policing , will be providing this advice in a personal capacity and on an unpaid basis , " a @entity83 statement said			1
@entity9 , who since 2009 has worked for private security consultancy @entity96 and its subsidiary @entity97 , is seen as having taken bold steps to cut crime rates in @entity3 and @entity4			1
" i would certainly be in a position to discuss the contemporary @entity14 experience and my work in these areas -- in particular the successes that created real reductions in gang - related crime in @entity109 , @entity3 and most recently in @entity4 , where we also saw significant improvements in the relations between the police and the city 's diverse communities , " he said in a statement on @entity97 's website friday			1
" there are many lessons from these experiences that i believe are relevant to the current situation in @entity16			2
" @entity9 said he believed the @entity6 government could overcome the problem , adding : " i support their resolve to seize upon this difficult situation as an opportunity to address the issues of gangs and gang violence and the resulting fear and disorder head - on			1

the uncle of two of the men killed , @entity146 , told reporters in @entity23 on saturday that the loss of @entity155 and @entity156 had " left our entire family in shock and devastation			0
" he went on : " all they wanted to do was to protect their business and other businesses within the community			0
i remember talking to @entity155 a few days before this tragic incident and he was excited and was looking forward to the birth of his first child in a few months ' time			0
but that was not meant to be			0
" a father will never hold his child , a child will never be held by his father , a wife without a husband , parents who have lost two sons			0
words can never express what we are going through at this moment			0
" @entity146 said the family did not want anyone else to suffer in the same way and appealed for witnesses to come foward			0
" all we want now is justice for our family			0
this was not ... about race , this was not religion			0
this was about a pure criminal act			0
" home secretary @entity191 announced friday that a march planned for saturday by the @entity193 , a far - right group , had been banned			0
" it is clear that a ban is needed to ensure communities and property are protected , " she said friday			0
officers would be deployed to @entity199 , the venue of the march , she said			0
meanwhile , @entity11 has angered some senior police officers by saying he thought that initially there were " simply far too few police deployed onto the streets " in @entity0 , and that " the tactics they were using were n't working			1
" " police chiefs have been frank with me about why this happened , " he said thursday			2
" initially , the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue rather than essentially one of crime			2
