-- to date , @entity3 has avoided the politicized and polarized abortion debate that is so prevalent in the @entity5 , our political parties have seen abortion as a ' private ' matter of personal and public ' health ' and not a matter of rights			1
the law gives women no ' right ' to abortion as in most @entity15 democracies -- but , if two doctors certify that it 's best for her health and well - being and the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks gestation , abortion is a legal option			1
we want people to be able to plan their families and to support and be responsible for their children , yet we know contraception sometimes fails and people fail to use it			0
abortion , as a back up to birth control , is generally seen as regrettable , but a fact of life			2
even in @entity36 , where abortion remains illegal , it 's accepted that women travel to the mainland			1
i am stunned when i talk with @entity42 colleagues about the violence and intimidation that their abortion doctors face			1
for them , a typical protest is several hundred strong -- for us a large protest is sometimes several dozen protesters , but more typically it is just several individuals			2
but , small as our protests are , they upset and disrupt women seeking safe and legal care from legitimate pregnancy advisory services			1
in recent weeks the @entity59 clinic of the @entity60 ( bpas ) , close to @entity63 's @entity62 , has been the focus of a @entity66 vigil			2
it is a ' mini-me ' version of @entity5 campaigns			1
women attending the clinic face a gathering of people praying for them to reject abortion			1
they are handed leaflets with fanciful claims about how abortion will raise their risk of cancer and mental illness			2
they are shown ' life - size ' models of their unborn baby and subjected to ' pavement counselling ' to encourage them to ' choose life			0
' for the present at least , women are no longer tormented with ' gifts ' of little knitted baby bootees , a feature of some previous vigils			2
the problem with the protests is this : the protesters oppose abortion in principle -- but their actions are against women who want to consider abortion -- not in principle -- but as a private medical solution to a personal , individual problem			1
women attend our clinics for care or counseling because they need help			1
they do not come to demonstrate support for abortion			2
the protesters should leave them alone , to deal with their problems privately with those they have chosen to seek help from			2
as the main abortion provider in @entity3 , bpas is not shy of debate			1
public education is part of our job and seeing more than 60,000 women with problem pregnancies each year puts us in a good position to explain what these women want and need			0
of course , society should debate the rights and wrongs of abortion			0
there are places for that and persons who are ready and willing to engage with the issues			0
outside a clinic is the wrong place , and women in immediate need of care are the wrong audience			1
the protesters have allies in the @entity3 @entity148 to voice their concerns			1
they have no need spend 40 days in the cold plaguing women			0
it is my job to answer for what bpas does , and i could not be more proud of the charity , its staff and its work			0
@entity60 really is ' genuinely ' pro-choice			0
part of our charitable mission is to alleviate distress in relation to fertility by providing advice , treatment and assistance			0
in the past we have provided infertility care as well as abortion -- and we hope to do so in the future			1
one marvelous response to the protests was that some complete stranger to bpas set up a website encouraging support for us			0
the comments posted speak volumes			0
those who accuse us of running ' abortion mills ' should ponder this comment by 's ' on march 17 , 2012 : " your advice and support helped me decide the right thing to do was keep my baby			1
being able to talk through my choices without judgment was undoubtedly the most important part of that process			0
long may you be able to support other women like me			0
" when a woman comes to us with a ' problem pregnancy , ' if she is undecided , our first aim is to help her to make the decision that she feels is right for her			0
we may not be able to make her feel ' happy ' about her decision ; she may choose what seems the ' least worst ' option -- but the decision will have been hers			0
this is what the protesters , who stand with their banners or lurk around our clinic entrances soliciting the attention of women approaching our doors , refuse to understand			1
they boast of the occasional woman they ' turn away ' -- but refuse to accept that thousands of ' bpas clients ' decide against abortion in any case			1
and we are glad when they are satisfied with that decision just as we are glad when a woman is satisfied with her abortion decision			0
that is what it means to be pro-choice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224			2

abortion is a legal option in the @entity3 if doctors agree
@entity224 says she is stunned by the intimidation that abortion doctors face in the @entity5
" women attend our clinics for care or counseling because they need help , " she says
@entity224 argues that protesters refuse to accept that thousands of ' bpas clients ' decide against abortion
