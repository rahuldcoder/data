-- @entity1 has threatened that it will retaliate against the @entity4 administration 's proposed new economic sanctions on @entity1 's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the @entity8			1
" if sanctions are adopted against @entity1 oil , " said @entity1 's vice president @entity9 , " not a drop of oil will pass through the @entity14 , " the narrow waterway at the mouth of the @entity8 , which one - fifth of the world 's oil supply passes through daily			1
to drive the point home , @entity1 has started a 10 - day naval exercise in the @entity8 to show off how it could use small speedboats and a barrage of missiles to combat @entity25 's naval armada			1
and the @entity26 has responded , in the words of a spokeswoman : " anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations ; any disruption will not be tolerated			1
" this is a significant escalation of tension between the @entity25 and @entity1 , and the start of a more dangerous phase in the @entity41 's attempt to curtail @entity1 's nuclear program			1
the new sanctions are a response to last month 's alarming report on @entity1 's nuclear intentions by the @entity48 nuclear watchdog agency , the @entity47			2
the @entity4 administration has ruled out military strikes to stop @entity1 's nuclear program in favor of tougher sanctions , which , once signed by the president , and if fully implemented , would sharply reduce @entity1 's oil revenue			1
the administration sees this added pressure on @entity1 's fragile economy as an effective alternative to military strikes			2
if @entity1 's reaction is any indication , the administration is correct in its estimation			0
sanctioning @entity1 's oil industry will cripple @entity1 's economy , and that in turn will threaten the stability of the clerical regime			1
it is for this reason that @entity1 is treating the proposed new sanctions as an act of war , and is issuing threats of its own to dissuade the @entity25 from going through with the new sanctions			1
the administration 's strategy is based on the assumption that cutting @entity1 out of the oil market will not substantially impact world oil supply and prices			1
@entity78 can step up production to cover the loss of @entity1 's export of 2 million barrels a day			0
but it is not clear whether @entity78 actually would increase production to compensate for the loss of @entity1 oil			2
@entity1 has clearly started a charm offensive with @entity87 to influence the @entity78 decision			0
@entity1 's intelligence minister recently visited @entity87 to reduce tensions between the two countries in the wake of the alleged @entity1 plot to assassinate the @entity78 ambassador to @entity95 , and the @entity96 has claimed that it rescued a @entity78 ship from pirates			0
in facing off against the @entity25 and its @entity100 allies , @entity1 thinks it holds economic cards of its own and is announcing loud and clear that if push comes to shove , it intends to use them			1
@entity1 notes that @entity105 economies are under stress and predicts they could not afford higher oil prices			2
even the threat of disruption in oil supply would send energy prices spiraling sky high , and that would plunge the already struggling economies of the @entity25 and @entity100 into deeper recession			2
@entity1 is hoping to change the conversation in @entity105 capitals from how tightly to squeeze @entity1 to what could be the cost of doing so			0
nor would economic woes caused by conflict in the @entity8 remain limited to the @entity41			0
@entity8 exports already account for 60 % of @entity124 's energy consumption			0
economies from @entity126 to @entity127 would be impacted by a @entity8 oil cutoff and higher energy prices			0
@entity1 is in effect threatening global economic crisis			0
those advocating new sanctions on @entity1 's oil industry have said little about the potential cost to the global economy			1
the cutoff would also hurt @entity139 countries and could drag them into a conflict with @entity1 they have thus far avoided			0
@entity1 hopes its saber - rattling will persuade @entity124 's economic powerhouses and @entity8 emirates to pressure @entity95 to back away from the new sanctions			0
war between the @entity25 and @entity1 may very well start , not if and when @entity95 decides to strike against @entity1 's nuclear facilities , but because sanctions designed as the alternative to military action end up hastening its advent			1
that might prove to be the least desired outcome , for no better reason than the possibility that the first casualty of another war in the @entity157 might very well be economic recovery in @entity25 and @entity100			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

@entity1 has threatened to block flow of oil through @entity14 if @entity25 sanctions its oil
@entity26 has warned that disruption in *traffic* will not be tolerated
@entity161 says the sanctions designed to *prevent* war could wind up causing it
he says the first casualty in a battle could be the world economy
