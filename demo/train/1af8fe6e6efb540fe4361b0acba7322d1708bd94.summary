-- millions of @entity1 are currently enthralled with the performance of our @entity1 soccer team in the @entity5 , as evidenced by the eruption of cheers that went up with when @entity8 scored a goal in the final minutes of the match against @entity11			1
his winning goal has been hailed as a watershed moment in @entity1 sports history , and " futbol " fans are predicting he will be talked about years from now in the same breath as @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
sorry folks , it 's just not going to happen , -- despite the praying by @entity0 's @entity26 correspondent , @entity25 , to make it so			0
it 's not that i detest soccer / futbol , but the reality is that @entity1 have not taken to the sport			1
as a native @entity34 , i sport the gear of the @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and my @entity39 ( @entity34 has the largest concentration of @entity39 ) , but the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) @entity41 did n't make the cut			0
every year i hear fans say that " it 's just around the corner " or " this is the year " or " the moment has arrived " when soccer is accepted along the lines of football , baseball and basketball			1
to be honest , even the @entity54 has suffered immeasurably , and judging by tv ratings , the lack of a major tv deal , and limited stars well - known to non-hockey fans , it 's safe to say it is no longer viewed as one of four major team sports			1
there are myriad reasons why soccer has n't caught on , but no one can say it 's because of the a lack of interest among the nation 's youth			2
millions of kids nationwide play the sport , from inner cities to the suburbs			0
yet once they become teenagers , soccer falls by the wayside and the interest shifts to baseball , football and basketball			1
there have been several attempts at launching a major professional sports league , and the latest is the @entity42 , which has been around since 1993			2
the league has valiantly tried to reach the big time , but it has struggled , largely catering to its small but loyal audience			0
if you walked into any sports bar in @entity1 , and those there had to choose which games to watch , the @entity90 , the @entity91 , @entity92 , the @entity93 or the @entity54 , would all likely win out over @entity42			1
although i 'm not personally a soccer fan , i 've watched a few minutes of the @entity101			1
but it simply has n't been a " must see " for me like the @entity103 or even the @entity104			0
and to be honest , the @entity104 is probably the greatest comparison in terms of measuring the interest of soccer to @entity1 fans			1
every four years we go nuts over our " amateur " athletic stars			0
we cheer wildly when the @entity1 bobsled team wins gold ; love to see our track stars fly around the oval ; and are enthralled with gymnastics			2
but once the @entity104 have ended , we store our " @entity1 ! @entity1 ! " chants for four years			2
i consider myself to be a huge track fan , and would love to see it on tv more , but the reality is that in other parts of the world , track stars are treated like @entity127 and @entity128			0
yet if @entity130 walked through a mall anywhere in @entity1 , he might get a few stares , but he would n't be bombarded with autograph requests for photos , even though he is the @entity127 of the track world right now			0
so soccer / futbol fans worldwide , do n't take it as insult that @entity1 do n't worship soccer the way you do			1
everyone has their likes and dislikes			0
that 's really just fine			0
you do you , and we 'll do what we do			0
as for the @entity101 , i 'll be cheering for the @entity8 - led @entity1 team to do well , while flipping back and forth to the @entity90 and @entity91 cable channels , pining for my two favorite sports to return in the fall			1
it 's just the @entity1 in me			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0

@entity158 says @entity1 are cheering the *success* of the @entity1 team in @entity101
he says soccer still will never catch on as one of @entity1 's major sports
fans are much more interested in @entity90 , @entity92 , @entity91 and @entity54
@entity158 : i 'm cheering for @entity1 team , but pining for return of football , basketball
