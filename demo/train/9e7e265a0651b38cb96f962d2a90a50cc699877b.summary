@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 successfully launched five satellites into orbit monday , one of them a mini-spacecraft built by students , space officials said			1
the main payload was a remote - sensing satellite -- @entity10 -- which the country 's space agency said would be used in infrastructure programs because of its capability to take high - resolution images of the @entity17			1
other smaller devices comprised satellites from a @entity26 university , @entity19 and @entity20 , a light - weight rocket made by @entity1 engineering students , the @entity18 said			1
monday 's launch came two months after an @entity1 satellite powered for the first time by a home - made cryogenic engine failed in what was seen as a setback to the country 's space ambitions			1
@entity18 spokesman @entity36 told @entity2 that scientists have identified the causes behind april 's misfire			0
@entity1 now aims to test the same domestically built technology within a year , he said			1
the @entity42 nation has an expansive space program			0
in 2008 , @entity1 sent its first unmanned mission to the moon , called @entity46 - i. @entity46 - 1 , meaning moon craft , dropped a tv - sized probe on the lunar surface , completed more than 3,400 orbits and met most of its scientific objectives in 312 days before vanishing off radars abruptly last year , according to the space agency			1
the satellite carried payloads from the @entity58 , the @entity59 and @entity60			0
one of its aims was to search for evidence of water or ice and identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks			0
the @entity46 mission came to be seen in @entity1 as the 21st century @entity42 version of the space race between the @entity58 and the @entity71 -- but this time involving @entity1 and @entity72			0
@entity72 launched a manned space flight in october 2003 , becoming the third nation in the world to put a person into orbit			0
@entity1 has not launched any manned space flights			2
@entity36 said the @entity1 agency also was planning to launch a second version of @entity46 in 2013			2
@entity1 held its first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern @entity1 in 1963			2
now , the @entity42 nation lists more than 60 events as " milestones " in its space program , which includes the successful use of polar and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles			0
@entity1 scientists say their country has the world 's largest constellation of remote - sensing @entity94 satellites , according to the @entity95 , capture images of the @entity17 used in a range of applications -- agriculture , water resources , urban development , mineral prospecting , environment , forestry , drought and flood forecasting , ocean resources and disaster management			1
another major system , or @entity110 , is used for communication , television and meteorology .			0

the payload ranged from a remote - sensing satellite to a student - built mini-spacecraft .
monday 's launch came two months after rocket failure
@entity1 also has launched satellite into lunar orbit
aims to launch another lunar probe in 2013
