president @entity0 did n't know of problems with the @entity3 's website -- despite insurance companies ' complaints and the site 's crashing during a test run -- until after its now well - documented abysmal launch , the nation 's health chief told @entity12 on tuesday			1
@entity14 rollout : 4 reasons why in an exclusive interview with @entity19 secretary @entity18 , @entity12 's dr. @entity16 asked when the president first learned about the considerable issues with the @entity14 website			1
@entity18 responded that it was in " the first couple of days " after the site went live october 1			2
" but not before that ? " @entity16 followed up			0
to which @entity18 replied , " no , sir			2
" @entity18 admitted that there is concern in her department and the @entity30 over the technical debacle surrounding the website rollout , saying " no one could be more frustrated than i am and the president			1
" the site was supposed to make it simple for people to search and sign - up for new health care policies starting on october 1 , but instead it 's been clunky and , at times , inoperable			0
" we 're not at all satisfied with the workings of the website , " @entity18 said			1
" we want it to be smooth and easy and let consumers compare plans			0
" @entity0 : no ' sugarcoating ' problems with website she noted how a team of high - tech experts from within the government and from @entity53 , and led by @entity54 -- a former ceo and acting director of the @entity57 , who will oversee the process for the next few months -- is coming to help address the issues			1
their arrival was announced earlier tuesday			0
why were n't they brought in before the website launched october 1 ? " we ( had ) hoped that they had their ' a-team ' on the table " from the start , @entity18 said of the contractors and agencies responsible for the project			1
as to now , " we want new eyes and ears			0
we want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table , that we get all the answers and accelerator the fix as quickly as possible			0
" the secretary attributed some of the problems to " extremely high " volume , claiming nearly 20 million people came to the @entity14 website in the first three weeks after its launched			2
yet only a fraction of those have signed up for new health care policies ; @entity18 said tuesday that 500,000 accounts had been created , but that does n't mean all those people enrolled in a plan			1
obamacare applications near half million it 's not like no one saw this coming			2
a number of insurance companies complained of problems ahead of the october 1 launch , and the website crashed during a test run although just a few hundred users were on it			1
despite the issues , the @entity0 administration went forward with the website			1
report : site failed ahead of rollout " there are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families , " said @entity18 , explaining why the launch was n't pushed back			1
" ... so waiting is not really an option			0
" opinion : obamacare a disaster that needs fixing republicans -- who , even before the website 's launch , had made targeting the program a centerpiece of their agenda , even initially insisting they would n't vote to fund the entire government unless @entity14 was defunded or delayed -- have been vociferous critics			1
they claim that the website 's woes show that @entity0 's administration and the federal government generally are n't capable of executing what the @entity120 says was an ill - advised program from the get - go			1
" @entity136 only knows how much money they 've spent , and it 's a failure , " sen. @entity133 , the leading @entity120 in the @entity134 , said sunday on @entity135			0
" the government is n't going to be able to get this job done correctly			0
" on the other side , @entity142 sen. @entity141 of @entity143 sent a letter to @entity0 asking that the open enrollment period be extended past march 31 , 2014 , and that he consider delaying assessment of a penalty to individuals who do n't sign up for any health insurance before the so - called " individual mandate " kicks in			1
" as you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process , it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the @entity162 people seeking to access health insurance , " @entity141 wrote			2
even the man whose name is forever tied to the health care reform has been critical , insisting monday there 's " no excuse for the problems " while at the same time insisting these should not equate to blanket condemnation of the @entity3 as a whole			0
" nobody 's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should , " @entity0 said , " which means it 's going to get fixed			1
" several top @entity120 -- including 2012 vice presidential nominee rep. @entity179 -- have called on @entity18 herself to step down due to the program 's problems			2
the secretary skirted questions tuesday about whether she 'd step down , saying only that she works " at the pleasure of the president " and is committed to her job			0
" i think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right , " @entity18 told @entity16			2
" and that 's really what i 'm focused on			0
" while refusing to give a timetable tuesday as to when the website will be fully operational , @entity18 insisted " it 's improving every day , and more people are getting through			1
" " more people are having an easier time , " she said , " and we intend to stay at this until we open the door 's wide open			0
" @entity201 calls for delay of @entity14 sign - up deadline and it 's too early to call the rollout a failure , the health secretary argued			0
there 's a long way to go for people to take advantage in person , by calling or by using the website during the open - enrollment period			2
when that six - month stretch is over , @entity18 said , people can make more valid judgments as to whether this part of @entity14 is a success or failure			0
@entity12 @entity222 : @entity14 @entity18 , rather than being disheartened by the website criticisms , says that what 's happened so far leaves her optimistic			1
" what we 're seeing in not only the states that are run by the federal website , but states around the country , is that interest is huge , " she said			0
" people are eager to have this affordable product , and that product is there			0

@entity142 senator urges @entity0 to extend enrollment , delay " mandate " penalty

delaying the website 's launch was " not really an option , " @entity18 says
she tells @entity12 an " a-team " of experts coming in , 3 weeks after launch
