a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order sunday that will allow the only abortion clinic operating in @entity3 to stay open -- for now			1
the @entity4 filed for the action in response to a new state law that would require a clinic 's abortion providers to be certified @entity11 practitioners , and for those physicians to all have privileges at an area hospital			1
the law , which took effect sunday , puts the clinic at risk , as all its doctors do not have such privileges			1
the judge 's order blocks enforcement of the law at least until the next hearing on the matter , which is scheduled for july 11			1
" i 'm jubilant , " said @entity28 , clinic owner and president			0
" it means the constitutional rights of women to make their decision , for the time being , is in place			0
" officials at the @entity38 clinic say they are working to comply with the law			2
all of its doctors are @entity41 who travel in from other states			1
but only one can practice at a local hospital			2
they say they are trying to gain privileges at @entity38 - area hospitals , but that the cumbersome process and red tape forced them to file for a reprieve			1
" @entity56 " is how gov. @entity53 described the decision , according to spokesman @entity55			0
the governor " plans to work with state leaders to ensure this legislation properly takes effect as soon as possible , " he said			2
state rep. @entity61 , who sponsored the legislation , said " we will speak with our attorneys regarding our game plan , " in response to the judge 's order sunday			1
@entity53 signed the bill into law in april after the @entity72 - dominated legislature overwhelmingly passed it			2
@entity3 is one of the toughest states on the abortion - rights movement			0
the state has laws requiring a 24 - hour waiting period , as well as parental consent if the patient seeking an abortion is a minor			2
@entity61 previously told @entity83 the intent behind the legislation was to ensure that women undergoing abortions are receiving care from a certified , professional physician			0
" if something goes wrong , which it might -- we hope it does n't , but it could -- that physician could follow the patient to a local hospital			0
and what happens afterwards , we 'll have to see what happens , " he said			0
but @entity28 believes that the real intent of the newly elected @entity72 majority was to end abortion in the state , not to improve women 's health care			1
" this is not about safety			0
politics do not need to be in our uterus , " she said .			0
