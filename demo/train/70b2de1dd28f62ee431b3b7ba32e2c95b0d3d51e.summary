@entity0 -- the @entity2 has again rejected broad privacy rights for some government workers			2
a unanimous bench on wednesday affirmed the government 's right to conduct personal background checks on current and prospective employees under federal contract , especially those in sensitive or high - security workplaces			1
the ruling rejected a lawsuit by 28 long - term scientists , engineers , and others at @entity18 's @entity17 near @entity19 , @entity20			1
the workers , who are independent contractors , claim the mandatory checks are overly intrusive -- permitting the government to obtain information on their health , finances , personal habits , and even their sex lives			1
all were classified as " low risk , " unlikely to have a major " adverse impact " on the agency 's mission			0
the forms required of workers " consist of reasonable , employment - related inquiries that further the government 's interests in managing its internal operations , " said justice @entity34 for the 8 - 0 court			1
justice @entity42 did not participate , since she briefed the case last year as the government 's solicitor general , before being nominated to the court by president @entity47			1
at issue was whether there is a constitutional right to " informational privacy , " free from overly intrusive state scrutiny			0
the high court 33 years ago suggested such a right existed , but the concept has rarely been tested since			1
the latest dispute comes amid a general increase in security concerns in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
the plaintiffs in the case argued they are not federal employees , but work at the @entity64 , a private university that operates the @entity17 for the space agency			1
they claim they are low - risk workers whose work is in the private domain , and that the university already conducted background checks when they were first hired			1
nevertheless , they were required to submit information to @entity18 , allowing the facility to maintain its broader security clearance as a government contractor			2
in a 2004 presidential directive , @entity18 and all federal agencies were ordered to increase their security measures			0
all civil servants and contractors are now issued special @entity82 badges and cards after first undergoing fingerprint checks and thorough screenings of their professional and personal lives			2
investigators are permitted to read criminal , financial and medical records , and to speak with friends , family , and neighbors of the workers			0
all federal employees and applicants are subject to such background checks , and the government says that applies to contractors as well			1
after some @entity17 workers complained , the lab posted a " suitability matrix " on its web site , listing criteria it believed @entity18 would consider when deciding suitability for future and continued employment			2
such factors , the lawsuit noted , included " carnal knowledge , sodomy , indecent exposure , voyeurism , obscene telephone calls , indecent proposals , incest , bestiality , homosexuality , cohabitation , adultery , illegitimate children , and mental , emotional , psychological , or psychiatric issues			2
" during oral arguments last october , @entity34 had , along with some of his colleagues , expressed some concern about the government 's assertions			0
" is there any limit ? " he asked			0
" suppose the government says : ' well , we want to know all about your diet			0
we want to know whether you smoke cigarettes			0
we want to know everything you read			0
we want to know what your hobbies are , what forms of entertainment you enjoy , sexual practices , every aspect of your private life , just because that gives us a better picture of who you are as an employee			0
' is that ok ? " the @entity147 's lawyer , @entity146 , said at the time there are limits , but added the government should have wide discretion to determine specific areas of inquiry , with appropriate safeguards			0
@entity34 in his 23 - page opinion agreed			0
" we reject the argument the government , when it requests job - related personal information in an employment background check , has a constitutional burden to demonstrate its questions are ' necessary ' or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests , " he wrote			1
last term , the high court ruled that a government worker did not enjoy a " reasonable expectation " of privacy on his official wireless two - way text - messaging pager			1
a @entity20 police officer had sued after authorities reviewed his phone records because of what they believed was excessive use of the pager device on the job			0
the review found hundreds of personal messages , some of a " sexually explicit " nature , to his wife , a girlfriend and a fellow officer			0
the officer then sued for invasion of privacy , but lost at the high court			1
private employees generally have less workplace privacy than do government workers			2
the @entity17 case raised the question of rights enjoyed in the quasi-official world of government contractors			1
in the @entity17 dispute , workers who refused to allow the background checks could be fired			1
the government told the high court that anyone receiving a government employment check should expect a security check			1
@entity147 lawyers warned that a ruling against the government would jeopardize its ability to obtain necessary information from contractors and regular government staff members			2
the case is @entity18 v. @entity214 ( 09 - 530 ) .			0

the high court affirms personal background checks by the government
the ruling applies to current and prospective employees under government contract
