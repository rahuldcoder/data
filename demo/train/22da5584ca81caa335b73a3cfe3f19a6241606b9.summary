@entity0 -- a transit advertisement depicting deceased @entity5 journalist @entity4 moments before he was beheaded by @entity6 was pulled from circulation in @entity0 and @entity8 , according to the attorney representing the organization behind the ads , @entity12			1
the ad , which read in part , " it 's not islamophobia ... @entity19 , " was intended to launch monday , appearing on buses and at the entrance of subway stops			1
@entity20 , the attorney representing the president of @entity12 , @entity22 , said he sent a letter to the @entity4 family attorney on behalf of his client sunday in response to a letter from the @entity29 ' attorney requesting the ad be pulled			1
@entity4 disappeared on november 22 , 2012 , in northwest @entity31 , near the border with @entity33			1
at the time of his disappearance , he was working for the @entity5 - based online news outlet @entity37			0
the video of his beheading was posted to @entity40 on august 19			0
@entity20 's letter reads in part : " as a mother , and one who still feels the pain of the hideous murders of many in her extended family by the @entity49 , and with friends in @entity51 brutally affected by @entity53 terrorism as a constant of daily life , ms. @entity22 understands and feels intimately the pain your clients are suffering			1
neither she nor @entity12 wish to add to that pain , even if only tangentially			0
" @entity4 's final months the letter goes on : " for this reason , and this reason alone , my clients have reached out as early as this morning to the @entity0 and @entity8 transit authorities ' respective advertising agents to pull the displays depicting the captive mr. @entity4 prior to his beheading			1
" @entity20 said the ad was pulled " as a matter of compassion for the family , " but the rest would remain in circulation			1
@entity22 , who is behind the campaign , said the ad featuring @entity4 is speaking out against jihad terror			1
" i am thinking of the family			2
i 'm thinking of the next victim as well , " @entity22 told @entity1 's @entity77 on wednesday			2
" but frankly , i think that that ad does a service to the family to expose the ideology that incites this kind of barbarity			1
" @entity85 , @entity4 's mother , said in an email monday that her family received the letter and " greatly appreciate the compassionate response			1
" @entity4 's mother ' appalled ' by @entity5 government handling of case @entity93 , the national communications director for @entity94 , told @entity77 , " these ads are targeted mainly at people who are not @entity97 trying to get them to hate @entity53 and be hostile to @entity5 @entity97			1
despite criticism , @entity22 said her message is not anti-muslim , it 's anti-jihad			2
" there is nothing in my ads that say @entity97			0
we oppose jihad , and the idea that it 's @entity108 , in my opinion , is a way of detracting from the message , " @entity22 said wednesday			2
one of the ads in circulation reads : " @entity114 - hatred : it 's in the @entity116			2
" @entity22 said she believes the @entity116 ignites jihad			0
" there are numerous , numerous , verses ... calling for the annihilation of the nonbeliever			2
smite them at their necks			0
... every action is accompanied by an @entity53 prayer , " she said			0
@entity129 , a religion professor at @entity130 , said , " to say that the quran in and of itself is really what guides the choices @entity97 make is really naive			0
" this is not the first time @entity22 has rattled emotions with edgy campaigns			0
in 2012 , when the metropolitan transportation authority rejected one of her ads , @entity22 took her message to federal court and won			0
the 2012 ad read : " in any war between the civilized man and the savage , support the civilized man			0
" all the ads launched monday in @entity0 have a disclaimer that reads : " the display of this advertisement does not imply @entity154 's endorsement of any views expressed			0

" it 's not islamophobia ... @entity19 , " ad says
