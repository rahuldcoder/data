two names and two families at the heart of a tragedy			0
@entity4 is one of three brothers , and what he calls their " private family business " has captured the attention of the world			1
" firstly i want to say , i am the brother of the convicted woman @entity11 " , he tells @entity13 in his first sit - down interview since the woman he claims is his sister -- known as @entity17 in media reports -- was sentenced to death by a court in @entity21 for abandoning the @entity23 faith			1
the woman , 27 , was raised as a @entity25 by her mother and is married to a @entity25 man			1
but because her father -- who deserted the family when the woman was a child -- was @entity23 , the courts consider her to be the same and asked her to recant her faith			1
she refused , and is now languishing in @entity33 , just outside @entity34			1
" her name is n't @entity17 , her name is @entity11			0
i am @entity43 , her full -- older -- brother , " @entity4 , speaking to @entity13 from an @entity37 in @entity33 , tells us as he rattles off dates and details in an attempt to prove this is the sister he grew up with			1
he says she started primary school in 1992 , and middle school eight years later			0
he even remembers the score she got on a critical exam -- " she got a 73.7 percent , " according to @entity4			1
@entity51 says his mother and brothers attended their sister 's university graduation ceremony in @entity34			1
nothing , he says , seemed amiss			0
then , he says , she met her husband @entity58 and his sister			2
he claims @entity58 -- whom he called " the @entity60 " -- fed his sister " potions " to convert her to @entity63			2
@entity64 and his wife tell a very different story			2
they say they were introduced through his sister in 2009 and married in 2011			2
@entity17 , as @entity64 calls his wife , was a committed @entity25 -- attending church with a frequency that far outstripped his own			1
@entity64 says he never saw the man claiming to be his brother - in - law until the trial began			1
when i put this to @entity78 , he tells me : " then she is lying to both the @entity25 and the @entity80			2
" " she went missing in @entity81 [ july ] last year for 45 days			0
that 's when we went to the police			0
when she was picked up we found her face was different , the way she looked at us was different			0
" when she stood in front of the court she said her name was @entity17			0
" the case dragged on for seven months , during which time they brought fingerprint and identity documentation , photocopies of which have since been disseminated to local reporters			0
the documents -- which the court ruled to be genuine -- purport to show that the fingerprints recorded for the national identity card issued in the name of " @entity105 " at the @entity21 government registry offices were an exact match to those the court took from @entity17			2
@entity64 told @entity13 that even if his wife is released , he fears for his family 's safety from @entity4 and his brothers			1
@entity64 is a @entity113 citizen and is attempting to secure asylum there for his wife , along with citizenship for his two children			0
that process , he says , is being delayed by @entity113 demands for paternity testing of the children			0
when asked by reporters earlier in the week if this was true , @entity123 spokeswoman @entity122 said , " genetic testing is a useful tool for verifying a biological relationship			0
" @entity17 -- or @entity105 -- is currently hoping her that the courts will believe the story of her life as she tells it , according to her husband			0
she insists that she was brought up by a @entity25 mother and has never practiced @entity23			2
and in spite of visits by religious scholars and @entity21 government officials pressuring her to recant , it 's a story she 's sticking to			1
i found myself returning to the same question time and again in this interview -- is @entity4 really prepared to see the woman he claims is his sister killed ? " it 's one of two ; if she repents and returns to our @entity23 faith and to the embrace of our family then we are her family and she is ours			1
we are prepared to hold her dearer than the apples of our eyes			0
but if she refuses she should be executed			0
" even as all eyes are on @entity21 's @entity156 , for @entity4 there is no turning back			1
" why would i indulge my humanity , my emotions and incur the wrath of my lord ? that 's not how it works for us			0
