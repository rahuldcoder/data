editor 's note : @entity2 is editor and chairwoman of the @entity4 , an independent research company , and was named one of the 20 most influential people in corporate governance by @entity8 and " the queen of good corporate governance " by @entity11			1
she has co-written three books			0
@entity2 says @entity14 's board must be held accountable for the $ 160 million in bonus payments			1
( @entity16 ) -- the stories about the outrageous $ 160 million bonus payments at @entity14 have all omitted the most important names			1
they are the members of @entity14 's board of directors @entity21			1
these people should have been on the hot seat before the @entity25 on @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , alongside ceo @entity29			2
although there is a lot of blame to go around , ultimately the buck stops -- or , i should say , the bucks should have stopped -- with them			2
why have n't we learned that it is the boards who are responsible for the massive failures of strategy and risk management at these companies ? regulators , journalists , securities analysts and investors routinely ignore the most obvious indicators of investment risk that are presented by bad boards of directors			1
this is particularly obvious in the case of @entity14 , which has been a serial offender in corporate governance , especially in executive compensation			1
those of us who remember former ceo @entity60 's departure from @entity14 in 2005 , after a corporate governance meltdown that included excessive compensation , appreciate the irony of his comment to @entity65 that the retention bonuses were " mind - boggling			1
" mr. kettle , @entity69 is on line 1			0
compensation committees are not responsible for individual pay packages below the ceo , but they are responsible for determining their overall structure -- and for making sure that the ceo 's job includes effective management on compensation issues			1
retention of employees may be a legitimate goal of a compensation program , but it can be accomplished in a way that is both effective and credible by being tied to performance goals and by delaying vesting until after the bailout funds are returned to taxpayers			2
the @entity4 released a report in february about the boards of the bailout companies , many of which were outliers in their governance and compensation practices			1
some of these were clear indicators of investment and liability risk			0
in several cases , we found individuals who not only sat on more than four corporate boards but also sat on more than one of these particularly troubled boards during this period			0
former white house chief of staff @entity106 , for example , served on the boards of @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 -- and at various times was also a director at @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
several other directors from these troubled boards also sat on either five or six boards altogether			1
we call the phenomenon of directors who serve on four or more corporate boards " overboarding			2
" @entity125 can limit the time and attention a director has for each board			0
it can also be an indicator of -- or a contributor to -- so many relationships and connections that it makes it more difficult to provide the respectful skepticism necessary for independent oversight			0
in all , 11 of the 27 companies we identified as " troubled " had at least one overboarded director			0
@entity141 had more than one ; at @entity144 , there were five			0
by comparison , fewer than 30 percent of @entity146 companies have even a single overboarded director , and fewer than 5 percent have more than one			0
another key finding from our analysis : shareholders at these companies were well aware of the relative weakness of these boards and had expressed their dissatisfaction by withholding votes from many of these individuals the year before these companies collapsed			0
at least 13 individual directors , all of whom sat on at least three corporate boards during this period , had received a 13 percent or higher negative vote			2
the highest of these was a 38.58 percent negative vote received by sir @entity170 at @entity171 , where he sat on the compensation committee			1
@entity170 also served on the boards at @entity174 ( as chairman and interim ceo ) , @entity177 and @entity178			0
although the businesses of these companies do not overlap enough to impair @entity170 's designation as an " independent " director or to create legal conflict of interest concerns , it is relevant that @entity171 owns ratings agency @entity186 's , which not only rates the other companies for which he was a director but also issues ratings on which the other companies rely in their assessment of risk			0
because of the extensive involvement that financial services companies have in many different aspects of the business of large public corporations , directors of those companies in particular should be especially cautious about overlaps and conflicts			0
badly designed compensation is an indicator of poor corporate governance , and poor corporate governance is an indicator of investment risk			0
instead of trying to tax the bonuses at @entity14 , the government and the shareholders should insist on new directors			1
the company 's web site says the compensation committee has five members			1
the two longest serving ones are @entity217 , who joined the committee on may 17 , 2006 and @entity219 , who joined it on january 17 , 2007 , according to the company 's 2007 proxy statement			1
the committee 's charter says its responsibility include making recommendations to the full board regarding @entity14 's compensation programs and reviewing and approving any hiring , severance or termination payments			1
people say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result			0
in this case , insanity is allowing the same people to continue to serve on the board after massive failure and expecting them to produce a different result			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : people often overlook crucial role of company board of directors
she says @entity14 's board is ultimately responsible for the firm 's *mistakes*
@entity2 : compensation committee members should be held to account
she says many finance firm board members are too busy on other boards
