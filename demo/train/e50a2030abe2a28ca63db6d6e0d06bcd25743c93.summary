@entity0 , @entity1 -- thirty - one years ago , the four men serving me tea at the table of an attractive house in @entity1 's capital were taking punishment from the @entity11 weather and an equally unforgiving enemy on a remote island chain in the @entity14			1
" suddenly we were in the coldest part of the country , with clothing and things not suitable for a climate like that , " said @entity15 , as he recalled his time as a soldier serving with the @entity18 during the @entity19 in 1982			1
" you 're walking with all those loads and everything , six or seven hours , you were sweating like hell ; and then suddenly you stop , as soon as you stop you started digging and sweat more , and then ... you were freezing , because the wind was blowing into the sweat , it was horrible			0
" despite the fact that the 7th @entity34 were a part of the @entity37 task force sent to repel an @entity39 invasion of the @entity40 -- known as the @entity40 by @entity39 , who also claim them -- their role has been largely absent from media accounts of the conflict			1
bloody conflict this is probably because they never got to fire a shot against their enemy -- though they felt the brunt of @entity39 bombs throughout the 74 - day conflict , with many of their number injured by flying shrapnel			1
by the end of the conflict @entity39 put its death toll from the conflict at around 645 , while @entity37 's civil and military losses amounted to 255 , according to the @entity65			1
the four comrades -- @entity67 , @entity15 , @entity68 and @entity69 -- are @entity1 and veterans of a detachment of a @entity18 that harks back to its colonial past			1
the @entity73 , composed of more than 3,000 soldiers of @entity1 descent , who traditionally served in the @entity76 before @entity77 became independent in 1947			1
the four were also talking to an @entity39 for the first time in their lives , which may have been a problem if the deep silence that followed this revelation was anything to go by			1
shared interests fortunately , two things saved the interview			0
first , i live in @entity88 , where they were based and trained for many years before @entity37 's handover of the territory to @entity92 in 1997			1
secondly , we share a passion for hiking -- a hugely popular pastime in @entity88 -- and a conversation about the city 's trails helped defuse the uneasiness			2
these men had joined the army in the 1960s , having had their first experience of war during the @entity106 -- a conflict between @entity37 - backed @entity108 and @entity109 that ended in 1966			1
" i was very new at the time , i had been with the regiment for , i think , two weeks , " @entity15 said			0
he was just 18 when he first saw action			0
on leaving the @entity18 in the 1990s , the men could have chosen to live in the country they had defended			0
but they chose their home in the @entity115			0
" i have been around the world , and @entity1 is the only country where you can see the mountains from your window , " @entity15 said			1
" i love @entity1 , most of our relatives and friends are here , " @entity67 added			1
" one [ of my ] daughters and two [ of my ] sons have @entity37 citizenship , but they do n't like to go there , therefore , i like to stay here in my motherland , " @entity69 explained			2
@entity39 ambition these men who have seen the world but never visited @entity39			2
" i always tell my daughter , one day i will definitely go to @entity39 , " said @entity15			2
" but if we go to @entity39 and if they know we are @entity138 who fought in the @entity40 , will they be angry with us ? " i could n't reply that question			2
nationalists exist everywhere but i believe most @entity39 want to forgive , forget and get on with their lives			2
at the end of the day , most of the men sent by my country to fight one of the most professional armies on @entity148 were still teenagers			0
" you could see on the faces of these guys , they were not fully trained for the war , " @entity15 recalled			0
" they were conscripts -- we knew that later on , " @entity68 added			0
as the men cycled through their wartime memories one thing became apparent : there was no clear advantage for either side during the confrontation			0
" they had better assets , they had better clothing , " @entity15 said			0
" all of their weapons were deployed there , " @entity68 continued			0
the men described having had one of their best battlefield meals from abandoned @entity39 rations			2
alternative outcome and this led to a second silence in the conversation while they pondered something else			0
what would have happened if the @entity39 military had enjoyed a more favorable outcome ? the hemisphere 's bloodiest dictatorship would have been strengthened and lengthened			1
fortunately , the ruling junta in @entity187 fell shortly after our defeat			0
i was just an eight - year - old boy when democracy finally ended our plight , and i am lucky to have almost no recollection of those bitter years ; i belong to the " almost - unscathed generation			0
" one of the most emotional parts of our encounter -- well after the end of our formal interview -- came when i thanked these aging @entity1 men , who were once young and thirsty for adventure , for helping to bring freedom to my country -- even if they did n't know it and despite the cost in human lives , @entity37 and @entity39 .			1
