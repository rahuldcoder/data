@entity0 , @entity1 -- " a force " has been mobilized by the @entity1 government to " seize " a @entity8 - flagged ship that 's been docked for days in a rebel - held port , despite a threat by @entity1 's leader that it might be bombed			1
two @entity1 ministers told reporters sunday that the " force " consists of " qualified " naval officers and " revolutionaries , " or former rebels now being paid by the government			1
it has authorization " to stop , seize or even strike ( the oil tanker ) with force if it does not comply with the orders issued for it , " said culture minister @entity20			1
" the aim is to receive this tanker , according to the law , without causing any casualties or damage , " said justice minister @entity25 , calling on those involved to surrender			0
" we hope this happens			0
" the vessel , dubbed @entity35 , docked late friday night in the oil port of as - @entity37			1
prime minister @entity38 said saturday that the ship 's captain subsequently was warned by phone to comply with government orders or face the consequences			2
the captain responded that local militia onboard did not allow them to depart			0
@entity38 threatened to bomb the oil tanker if it did n't comply with @entity1 's request			1
on sunday , @entity20 echoed the prime minister 's concerns that a bombing could cause a large oil spill and said the " force " focused on the issue " realizes the sensitivity of the situation and the risks			1
" " they are dealing with ( this ) in kind of a surgical method , " said the cultural minister , noting that one option may be to lead the tanker to an area where more @entity1 government forces can safely seize it			1
the @entity68 weighed in sunday , with spokeswoman @entity69 expressing concern about @entity35 " loading a cargo of illicitly obtained oil			2
" " this action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the @entity1 people , " @entity69 said			1
the situation speaks to the unsettled situation in the @entity80 nation , which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime @entity1 leader @entity83			2
in this case , the issue centers around the oil - rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular , @entity89			2
the militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports			0
but last july , @entity89 and his men seized them , blocking oil exports , and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region			0
meet the man holding @entity1 's oil hostage " we used to be part of that government until the corruption became so visible , and the government started to sell oil without measuring units , and after we became certain that such a government is not credible and unable to rebuild the state , " @entity89 , 32 , told @entity2 's @entity101 in january			1
" that 's why we declared independence of our province and we started to seek our fair rights			0
" there is a lot at stake , given the @entity1 government 's precarious state and the wealth of natural resources in the country			2
@entity1 is thought to have @entity123 's largest proven oil reserves			2
the country produced 1.6 million barrels per day after the revolution only to have that output slow to a relative trickle of fewer than 200,000 barrels per day by the end of last year			0
the government has said the disrupted oil production , from the seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities , is costing the country $ 130 million a day			0
the oil at the center of the current @entity140 - @entity37 situation belongs to @entity1 's @entity141 and its partners , which @entity143 from the @entity68 notes includes @entity145 companies			1
" any oil sales without authorization from these parties places purchasers at risk of exposure to civil liability , penalties and other possible sanctions , " @entity69 said			0
the threat of force against the @entity8 - flagged vessel is n't the first time @entity1 's government has threatened force against ships that enter the eastern oil ports			1
on several occasions , authorities have issued ultimatums to such ships , only to have those deadlines come and go with no action			0
@entity2 's @entity169 reported from @entity1 and @entity2 's @entity170 reported and wrote from @entity171			0
@entity2 's @entity172 contributed to this report .			0
