nursing mother @entity0 has taken to @entity2 to ask why @entity3 forced her to check her breast pump			1
@entity0 was boarding @entity5 2034 last week traveling from @entity6 to @entity8 - @entity7			0
it was her second flight of the day for a business trip that would keep her away from her baby for four days			0
the gate agents would n't allow @entity13 to board the january 19 flight with her breast pump , which was packed in her standard carry - on suitcase , @entity0 said			1
she also had her purse and a cooler with ice packs to transport her breast milk			2
@entity3 and other airlines allow one carry - on bag and one personal item , such as a purse , for free			1
medical devices , strollers and certain other equipment are also allowed and do n't count against a traveler 's carry - on allowance , according to airline policy			1
the gate agent first told her that she needed to consolidate her luggage , even after @entity0 says she told the agent that the suitcase included a medical device			1
" she then said the computer just gave her a message stating that all passengers starting with me would need to check their bags , " @entity0 told @entity1			1
" when i later entered the jet bridge , passengers lining up behind me had their suitcases			0
" passenger @entity42 , who says she does n't know @entity0 , said she saw and heard much of the exchange as she was waiting in line to board the aircraft			1
" i saw a young woman who seemed really troubled , and the ticket agent continued to say , ' you ca n't take it on ; you 're going to have to check your bag , ' " said @entity42 , executive director of the @entity47 of @entity48			1
" she kept saying , ' i have a medical device i need to bring with me on the plane , ' over and over , visibly upset , " @entity42 told @entity1			2
" the ticket agent and her supervisor , who she eventually called over , were not helpful and not supportive			2
" " when i got onto the flight , there were at least five available spots in the overhead bins , " @entity42 said			0
even if the flight had been full , @entity42 said , they could have asked for volunteers to check their luggage so @entity0 's breast pump could be carried on the flight			1
" there was no initiative to help her			0
" @entity0 , who could n't pump for eight hours , finally picked up her breast pump in her suitcase at the @entity8 - @entity7 airport baggage claim , she said			1
" @entity3 supports the rights of women to breastfeed , " @entity3 spokeswoman @entity73 wrote in an email			1
" breastfeeding and breast pumps are permitted aboard any @entity3 flight and in @entity3 ground facilities			1
we have apologized to the customer for her experience			2
" @entity3 's policy on its website , under infant travel , explicitly mentions breast pumps : " @entity3 fully supports a woman 's right to breast - feed on board @entity3 and @entity91 aircraft and in @entity3 facilities			1
breast pumps are allowed on board			2
" other @entity94 airlines have similar policies			0
" @entity98 welcomes nursing mothers who wish to breastfeed on the aircraft and / or within our facilities , " @entity98 spokeswoman @entity96 wrote in an email			0
" we do not have restrictions on nursing			0
breast pumps are considered a medical device and do not count towards the number of carryon items			2
" " when flying on an @entity111 flight , breastfeeding mothers are welcome to do so during all phases of flight , " @entity111 spokeswoman @entity110 wrote in an email			0
" they are welcome to bring breastfeeding equipment on board as it does not count as a carry - on item			0
" @entity94 's policy is n't online , but passengers can call the reservations number to get more information , @entity121 said			2
" no prohibitions on breastfeeding for us , " @entity127 spokeswoman @entity126 wrote in an email			0
she made no mention of the use of breast pumps on @entity127 flights			0
@entity0 says she hopes to increase awareness around women 's rights to breastfeed and pump on airlines			0
with her new @entity140 page , @entity141 , she wants encourage airlines to post their pro-breastfeeding and breast - pumping policies inside all aircraft			0
she says she pitched the idea to @entity147 , @entity3 ceo @entity148 's executive assistant , who she says called her to talk about the incident			1
" i told her that on behalf of all nursing moms , i would be extremely grateful if this change happened , " @entity0 said			0
( a @entity3 spokeswoman did n't comment on that conversation			1
) @entity0 hopes her proposal would encourage airline staff members , increase flying women 's awareness of their rights aboard and decrease their anxiety around breastfeeding and pumping aboard , she said			0
it 's not the first time @entity3 has faced conflict over breastfeeding			2
in february , a passenger tried to confirm @entity3 's breastfeeding policy before flying because her child wo n't drink from bottles or be covered while eating			1
an official @entity2 account suggested that she pump before boarding			0
later , the account apologized for incorrectly stating the airline 's policy and said she was free to breastfeed .			2

a @entity3 passenger claims a gate agent forced her to check her suitcase
the agent would n't budge , even after she was told it contained her breast pump
the airline has since apologized
