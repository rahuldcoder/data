@entity0 -- impossible to explain , harder to believe			1
this week a young man in the prime of his life went to work			1
he was the envy of many because he loved what he did , and was living a dream he 'd held onto since he was a boy growing up on a farm			1
he did not come home			2
a wall did not fall on him , a tractor did not overturn			2
enough headlines have already told us that @entity17 cricketer @entity16 died as a result of a freakish accident			1
hit on the head by a ball delivered at about 140 kilometers an hour			2
in this age of the relentless news cycle , story angles have been sharpened and pointed			2
questions need to be asked			2
one in particular : could the accident have been avoided ? the simple answer is " yes , " but then comes the " if only			1
" not just one , but a crowd of them			2
if only @entity16 's head had been at a different angle			1
if only his helmet had provided greater protection			2
if only bouncers were banned			2
if only ... the words are never more tormenting than at times of tragedy somewhere , hiding behind the obvious is a deeper , much more provocative contemplation : if only we -- fans , administrators , the media and players -- did n't encourage danger in sport			1
a fast bowler firing throat balls at a squirming batsman			2
a quarterback blindsided into the turf			0
race cars bumper - to - bumper at 150 miles an hour			0
unscripted theater why do we want to watch ? because such moments are exhilarating			1
for the fans it is the most captivating unscripted theater			1
for the administrators it is dollars through the turnstiles , for the media it is back - slaps when the ratings come out , and for the elite athlete ? well , he or she may not always enjoy every moment of it , but the opportunity to negotiate the fragile line between invincibility and fallibility is one of the most enticing challenges of any risk - associated sport			1
to see him kick up his heels and punch the air when celebrating a century was not the sign of a champion who 'd had an easy fight			0
when cricket administrators sit down and analyze frame by excruciating frame of @entity16 's last stand , they will see a picture that is much more complex than a split second of disaster			1
nowhere has this become more apparent than in the @entity90 where the @entity91 has discovered that playing fields stretch well beyond the turf to the courtroom			0
legal action by former players over concussion - related brain problems is costing the @entity98 hundreds of millions of dollars			1
at the core of the issue are accusations that officials concealed the danger of concussions while encouraging players to get back on their feet and charge into the fray again			1
it 's what the fans wanted			1
it also made for good promo reels			0
and that of course helped the bucks roll in			0
other high impact football codes across the world are taking notice			0
the days of smelling salts are over			0
athletes are commodities all elite sports have their own problems			1
needles , @entity125 , and the @entity126 immediately come to mind			0
and so does @entity129 soccer where justice is being sought for @entity131			0
twelve years ago an inquest ruled that he had died from brain trauma caused by heading heavy leather balls in the 1950s through to the 70s			1
across many sports , there remain many lessons to learn			0
these days , it is a multi-billion dollar industry			0
athletes are commodities , mobile billboards with marketing clauses built into their contracts			0
they must do what their bosses tell them			0
otherwise , it 's " thanks for your efforts , good luck in the future			0
" the pressure they face is immense			0
again , @entity16 knew that			1
he was on the brink of a recall to the @entity17 test team , the highest honor of his sport , his job			1
now , he will never get that chance			0
it 's up to all of us to decide what that really means .			0

@entity17 cricketer @entity16 died as a result of a freakish accident
could it have been avoided ? only if we did n't encourage danger in sport
risk *creates* captivating unscripted theater for fans and dollars for managers
and allows elite sportsmen to negotiate the fragile line between invincibility and fallibility
