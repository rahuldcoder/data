-- a landlord wants the @entity2 on thursday to reconsider its finding that she violated the law by posting a " white only " sign at her swimming pool			1
@entity7 has asked the commission to reverse its initial ruling that found she violated the @entity10 by putting up a sign that read " @entity15 , @entity16 only " at her @entity13 duplex			1
the commission , meeting this week in @entity18 , concluded last year that the sign " restricts the social contact between @entity20 and @entity21 as well as reinforcing discrimination actions that are aimed at oppressing all ' people of color			2
' " the case was brought by @entity28 , a white man who said had unrestricted access to the pool area for himself and his guests during the nearly two years he lived in the duplex , he said in a december interview			2
@entity28 , a software engineer , said he and his girlfriend , who is also white , lived upstairs ; their 31 - year - old landlord lived downstairs			0
however , he said their relationship soured in may 2011 when he invited his 10 - year - old biracial daughter to visit and swim in the pool			1
" complainant states that the owner , @entity7 , accused his daughter of making the pool ' cloudy ' because she used chemicals in her hair , " the commission said in its summary			1
" days later , the owner posted a sign on the gate to the pool which read , ' @entity15 , @entity16 only			1
' " @entity52 said she received the sign from a friend and posted it in early may , the summary says			1
several people interviewed by the commission staff confirmed that they had seen the sign , it added			2
@entity52 did not respond to a request for comment at the time			0
but she told @entity63 in december that she collects antiques			0
she said the sign , which was dated 1931 and from @entity66 , was a gift from a friend			0
" i do n't have any problem with race at all			0
it 's a historical sign , " she told @entity63			0
@entity28 said he was outraged by the sign and made arrangements to find another place to live as soon as he could			0
" we were extremely upset and moved out on june 21 , 2011 , in order to not expose my daughter to the sign and the humiliation of the message , " @entity28 wrote in his complaint			0
he said he never confronted @entity52 about the matter , but has no doubt that the sign was intended for his daughter .			1
