@entity1 , @entity0 -- opposition activists formed a human chain outside one of the entrances to @entity7 on saturday afternoon to prevent two @entity0 military tanks from crossing through barricades into what has effectively become an @entity12 enclave in the heart of the @entity0 capital			1
an eyewitness said scuffles broke out after an army general asked demonstrators to take down their makeshift barricades of corrugated steel and debris , which were built up during 48 hours of bloody fighting with regime supporters next to @entity1 's landmark @entity24			1
" this general went through the barricades , they [ the soldiers ] knocked down some barricades on the way to the museum , which caused some panic and scuffling , " said photographer @entity26			1
" when he did it all chaos broke loose			2
" @entity26 said that initial tension was defused after gen. @entity38 began negotiating with medics who have established a first aid station for wounded combatants just behind the first line of barriers			2
" he is still talking to doctors at the clinic , " @entity26 said			0
" he is asking them to remove the clinic			0
" later , @entity38 made a tour of @entity7			1
military guards in red berets struggled to hold back the enthusiastic crowd as many @entity0 tried to embrace and kiss the general amid chants of " the military and the people are one hand			2
" over the past week , @entity7 has been transformed from a bustling urban center into a fortified campground inhabited by thousands of well - organized @entity12 demonstrators			1
it includes sidewalk first aid clinics and stations for charging cell phones , and the protesters respond to threats by blowing whistles and clanging metal rods			2
the alarm prompts scores of men to race to the entrances to the square , where rocks for stone - throwing are stockpiled in preparation for possible battles			0
eyewitnesses said @entity38 's visit appeared aimed at trying to persuade demonstrators to reopen the square to ordinary traffic			2
the officer took to the stage erected at the north end of the square for several minutes and made an unsuccessful attempt to appeal to the demonstrators			0
" you can all express your views and opinions freely , but i ask you to put the security of @entity0 first , " @entity38 announced through a loudspeaker system			0
" this is directed to the youth of january 25th , " he added , referring to the date when protests first erupted , throwing @entity0 into what many observers now call a political revolution			0
" there are many people who are manipulating you , " @entity38 said			0
the crowd chanted a simple answer : " no , no , no. " the general concluded his short statement by saying , " i do n't understand what it is you want			0
" the crowd roared back a chant that has been repeated for days across the open expanses of @entity7 : " leave , leave , leave			1
he leaves , we leave			1
" this call for @entity0 president @entity112 to resign is the demand that unites the grass - roots movement in @entity7			1
after hearing the answer from the crowd , @entity38 left the stage and the square without saying another word .			0
