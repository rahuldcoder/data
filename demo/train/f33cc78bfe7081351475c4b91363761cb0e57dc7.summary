@entity0 -- as the @entity4 completes its withdrawal of all military forces from @entity3 by the end of the month , @entity3 's prime minister made a pitch to leaders of @entity4 commerce and industry tuesday : @entity3 is open for business			1
in an address to @entity4 executives at the @entity4 @entity16 in @entity0 , @entity3 prime minister @entity13 said his country offers " limitless " opportunities for @entity4 companies			1
@entity13 said his country is trying to diversify from an energy - dominated economy , to one that focuses on financial , medical , agricultural , educational and infrastructure services as well			2
the end of @entity4 military operations in @entity3 heralds the beginning of a " wider relationship " between the two countries where " not generals but businessmen " will focus on economic and political engagement between the two countries , @entity13 told the audience			1
he spoke to more than 400 executives representing a wide range of industries including petroleum , engineering and construction , commercial aviation , architecture , maritime cargo and financial services			0
as @entity4 investment in @entity3 has increased since 2008 , @entity13 said @entity3 wants to see a much greater presence of @entity4 companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country 's infrastructure as a way to better the lives of @entity3 and create more @entity4 jobs in the process			1
total foreign direct investment in @entity3 hit $ 70 billion for the first months of 2011 , according to the chamber			0
the @entity4 has increased its investment from nearly nearly $ 2 billion in 2010 to more than $ 8 billion this year , the organization said			0
that figure represents 11.6 % of all investment entering @entity3 , the chamber said			0
the @entity63 has projected the @entity3 economy to grow at a faster pace than @entity66 or @entity67 over the next two to three years			0
despite growing @entity4 investment in @entity3 , the chamber continued its own pitch to @entity4 businesses of the potential @entity3 represents for them , and @entity4 workers , before @entity13 spoke			1
" we continue to trail our trading partners with respect to investment and economic engagement in @entity3 , " said @entity73 , vice president for @entity74 and @entity75 at the chamber			0
the private sector stands to play a crucial role in filling the capacity void left in many sectors of the @entity3 economy following the @entity4 military departure , @entity73 said			2
winning business for @entity4 firms in @entity3 has not been an easy prospect in the past			2
not a single @entity4 energy firm secured a deal for oil production at an auction of contracts by the @entity3 government two years ago			1
many members of @entity98 were outraged , and questioned the @entity4 investment in @entity3 to that point after lucrative multi-billion - dollar contracts went to @entity102 and @entity66 firms instead			1
in the past year , the @entity4 @entity103 in @entity3 was established to advance commercial interests for @entity4 firms operating in @entity3			0
opportunity aside , @entity13 acknowledged the difficulty of moving his country from the planned economy of the @entity110 era to a market - based system governed by transparency laws and international regulations , not to mention convincing @entity4 businesses to invest in a country that still experiences a high volume of violence			1
he assured his audience that his government was doing all it could to root out corruption and make the country safe for businesses to operate			0
" make no mistake , this is a country that 's developing , its commerce is developing , it 's going to take time , it 's going to take energy , " deputy secretary of state @entity122 told @entity1 after @entity13 spoke			0
" @entity4 companies are going there because they believe they can make money and at the end of the day that 's what it is about , and most of these companies have dealt with complicated environments			2
@entity3 is no different , but we have seen huge progress			0
" @entity122 said the " robust diplomatic staff " still based in @entity3 after the military withdrawal will include large economic and legal teams to work with @entity4 companies operating in @entity3			1
nearly 40 leaders from the @entity3 private sector made the trip to @entity0 with @entity13 to meet with their @entity4 counterparts .			2
