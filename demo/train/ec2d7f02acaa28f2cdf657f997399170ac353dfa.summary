the scandal over allegations about @entity3 surveillance overseas , including monitoring of the cell phone conversations of @entity7 chancellor @entity6 and millions of phone calls in @entity9 , is another huge blow to president @entity11			1
the news has caused a big uproar in @entity14 , with @entity6 demanding a response from @entity16			0
it was " incredible that an allied country like the @entity19 and at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification , " said @entity23 , the prime minister of france			2
" trust needs to be rebuilt , " @entity6 said			0
while observers warn these complaints are hypocritical and have more to do with domestic politics in @entity14 than true feelings about the @entity19 , this incident is nonetheless much more than a mere blip in the time line of @entity11 's presidency			1
the recent @entity3 revelation is one more step in a series of revelations about practices that have undercut a central promise that candidate @entity11 made in 2008 -- to repair @entity19 's standing in the world			1
when @entity11 took office , @entity19 's position in the global community had greatly deteriorated			1
president @entity44 's war in @entity46 , and his unilateral approach to foreign policy , had generated tremendous distrust and anger overseas , including among our closest allies			1
so , too , had @entity44 's apparent disregard for civil liberties and willingness to ignore international standards against the use of torture			1
the @entity19 was seen as a country that acted solely in its own interest and that cared little for protecting strong and durable multilateral alliances			2
the @entity19 , in the minds of its critics , also took reckless actions to defend its national security interests without thinking about the consequences			2
@entity11 was determined to correct this			2
this had been a constant theme of his campaign against presidential opponent sen. @entity73 , more so than almost any domestic issue			0
in june 2008 , speaking in @entity7 near the place where the @entity76 once stood , @entity11 said that , " in @entity14 , the view that @entity19 is part of what has gone wrong in the world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common			1
" he continued to expound on this theme in his first year as president			0
his stirring speech in @entity86 in june 2009 offered inspirational words to many of his supporters , evidence that the president was serious about fixing the damage that had occurred under @entity44			2
but the promise is unfulfilled			0
over the years , it has become clear that @entity11 left much more of @entity44 's foreign policy framework in place than many of his supporters had expected			1
he continued with an extremely aggressive campaign against terrorist networks , employing drone strikes to destroy networks even when there have been significant civilian causalities , allowing for tough interrogation techniques and detention policies and depending on secret processes that created little accountability for what the government was doing , other than when leakers revealed classified information			0
inconsistent policies toward authoritarian @entity113 regimes in countries such as @entity115 , as well as turbulence in @entity117 following the fall of @entity119 , have greatly dampened the enthusiasm about @entity11 that had existed after 2008			1
nor did @entity11 do much to strengthen civil liberties			2
the public has begun to learn how extensive the surveillance has been on their phones , on their computers and every other type of communication that occurs			0
in short , the government has been watching			0
to be sure , the success at generally preventing terrorist strikes within the @entity19 , barring @entity132 , is a central accomplishment of his presidency			0
but the difficulties he has faced achieving the balance he promised in relations with the rest of the world have come with a cost			0
the @entity3 issue began with a debate about the proper domestic balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism and has now has extended into the realm of diplomacy			0
@entity11 needs to make this right			1
the controversy hurts the ability of the @entity19 to maintain strong relations with the allies whose support is essential to the war on terrorism , as well as in fighting against other global threats			1
he must provide answers and show that the government is responding to concerns about @entity3 practices			0
one administration official has told the @entity165 that president @entity11 had been unaware of @entity3 spying on 35 world leaders and that , as soon as he learned of the practice through an internal review ( a response to the political outrage over the revelations of the spy program ) , he put parts of the program to an end			2
even if this is the case -- and the president will need to make clear this is so given how cynical and skeptical the world has become about @entity19 political rhetoric on these matters -- the information begs the question of how the @entity3 was allowed to remain so unaccountable even to the commander - in - chief and , more importantly , what steps president @entity11 will now take to make sure we conduct our counterterrorism programs within some kinds of parameters and guidelines			1
if @entity11 does nothing further , the ongoing revelations will leave behind the same kinds of problems that he , as a candidate , understood to be so devastating in 2008 .			0

@entity199 : @entity11 promised to reverse @entity44 's unilateral approach
he says by *sticking* with @entity44 's policies , @entity11 has *disappointed* allies , friends
@entity199 : @entity11 needs to make good on his promise to have @entity19 work better with the world
