@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former teammate of once acclaimed , now embattled former cyclist @entity4 said friday that there was no question why @entity8 team members doped during big races			1
" it was done by the team , but it was done for the @entity12 so i could be a good teammate for @entity4 , " @entity10 told @entity2 on friday			1
" he wanted you to be riding your best in the biggest races			2
" @entity10 , who admits he 's not @entity4 's " biggest fan , " is one of 26 witnesses who testified to the @entity18 as part of its investigation into doping by @entity4 and other riders on the team			1
@entity4 's legacy may withstand accusations in its report , released wednesday , the organization tasked with keeping banned substances out of @entity32 @entity31 - sanctioned sports said it had uncovered " overwhelming evidence " that @entity4 had participated in and helped run the cycling team 's doping program			1
@entity4 's lawyer @entity36 dismissed the @entity18 report as a " one - sided hatchet job " and a " government - funded witch hunt " against the seven - time @entity12 winner , who has consistently denied doping accusations			1
@entity4 decided to give up fighting the agency 's investigation in august , after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit he had filed seeking to stop the probe			1
@entity10 was one of two former members of @entity4 's cycling team who spoke to @entity2 friday about the doping allegations			1
@entity50 , a former part masseuse and part personal assistant to @entity4 and his cycling team , said she hoped her decision to talk about doping -- which she first did nearly a decade ago and more recently through the @entity18 report -- will help make the sport of cycling better , rather than simply bring @entity4 down			1
" i think that now , more than ever , this is the opportunity for riders to have the choice to ride clean and stay clean if they choose to , " @entity50 told @entity2			0
the @entity18 sent its report -- chronicling what it called " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen " -- to international cycling authorities , who are considering a request to strip @entity4 of his @entity12 titles and other wins			1
and the @entity72 said friday that it also is examining the agency 's evidence to decide if it should consider taking away the bronze medal @entity4 won in the @entity76 , according to spokesman @entity77			1
meanwhile , the @entity79 cycling team announced friday that it is parting ways with @entity81 , who managed the @entity8 and @entity83 racing teams on which @entity4 raced			1
in its report , the @entity18 said " the overwhelming evidence in this case is that @entity81 was intimately involved in all significant details of the @entity32 postal team 's doping program			1
" @entity81 is among three former @entity8 and @entity83 team officials who are fighting the charges			2
the @entity92 team said the mutual decision " is necessary to make this decision since @entity81 can no longer direct the @entity94 in an efficient and comfortable way			2
" on his website , @entity81 said he was " surprised and extremely disappointed " the @entity18 released its findings before he could review them			2
" i still hope to be able to defend myself in a forum free from bias , although i now fear that @entity18 's calculated action may have irreversibly prejudiced my case , " he said			2
@entity4 teammates recount tricking drug testers in her affidavit , released wednesday , @entity50 reiterated allegations she first made in a 2003 book " @entity108 " by two journalists on allegations against @entity4			2
she told the agency she engaged in clandestine trips to pick up and drop off what she assumed were doping products and said she was in the room when @entity4 and two other team officials came up with a plan to backdate a prescription for corticosteroids for a saddle sore to explain a positive steroid test result during the @entity122			1
" now , @entity50 , you know enough to bring me down , " she says @entity4 told her after the meeting			2
" the quote has got a bit dramatized , " she said			0
" history has shown that i did n't have enough to bring him down , and i never wanted to bring him down			0
never , ever wanted to bring @entity4 down			2
" doping was commonplace in cycling in the ' 90s , @entity50 said , as integral to the sport as the bikes that bore riders up and down the @entity136 hillside			0
she said she tried to distance herself from doping activities but felt some pressure to go along			0
she said she first came across doping by the team in 1998 , when she said a man gave her a package that he described as testosterone for team cyclist @entity144			0
the man , whose name is redacted from the affidavit , warned her not to travel to the @entity32 with it , @entity50 said			0
@entity144 acknowledged using banned substances in his affidavit to the @entity18 and in a statement released the same day			0
that same year , she says , @entity4 gave her a small plastic - wrapped package after a race in @entity153 and asked her to dispose of it			0
@entity50 said @entity4 told her it " contained some things he was uneasy traveling with and had not wanted to throw away at the team hotel			1
" @entity50 also recounted buying makeup for @entity4 to conceal what she said he described as bruise from a syringe injection during a race			0
while @entity50 said she never saw @entity4 use banned substances -- though she felt sure that he did -- @entity10 had a different story , saying " the first time i ever blood - doped was with @entity4 " and that @entity4 was well aware and involved with everything that happened			1
the @entity171 - born cyclist recalled how the @entity8 team had a @entity136 man , whom he referred to as @entity174 , who followed the tour on his motorcycle to deliver the performance - enhancing drug @entity177 at different stops			0
your @entity4 questions answered asked why few cyclists on his team were caught despite what he characterized as repeated doping , @entity10 said they just did as they were told			1
" the team doctors told us what we could take , when we could take it , how long it would stay in our system , " he said			0
" so if we followed those simple rules , 99 times out of 100 , we would pass			0
" having first tested positive for doping in 2004 , @entity10 said he continued to lie -- pointing to what he called omerta , or " the code of silence ... within the top tier of cycling			2
" " i believed that was my only way back into the sport , " he said			0
" it is a bit of a mafia			0
it 's a powerful group			0
you can say the wrong thing , and next thing you know ... " it was n't until last year , with an interview on @entity213 ' " @entity212 " and the publication of a book the following year , that @entity10 came clean about being a chronic user			0
he said telling the truth has been cathartic for him , while expressing understanding about his former teammate 's continued denials			0
" i lied for a long , long time			0
and you start believing some of your lies , " said @entity10 , who accused @entity4 of trying to intimidate him a year and a half ago			1
" and he 's got himself really backed into a corner			2
" @entity4 on giving up fight against doping accusations @entity2 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			1
