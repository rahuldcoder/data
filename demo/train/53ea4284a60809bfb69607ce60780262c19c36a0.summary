peace talks between @entity1 and @entity2 are about to run out of oxygen			1
the final weeks of a nine - month negotiating window closes at the end of april and the two sides still stand far apart			0
the talks could end in a matter of days with disturbing consequences			0
what to do ? secretary of state @entity11 has an idea : how about releasing @entity13 , the convicted @entity14 spy who has already spent almost three decades in prison for passing information to @entity1 ? according to a number of reports , a deal to free @entity13 and extend talks through 2015 is in the works			1
@entity13 has nothing to do with the two - state solution , with the future status of @entity25 , with whether or not @entity2 will ever recognize @entity1 as a jewish state , with @entity28 settlements , or with any of the issues in dispute			1
but releasing him could give @entity1 prime minister @entity31 some political cover to make unpopular decisions			1
over the years , a growing number of @entity1 -- along with many prominent @entity14 officials -- have come to see the severity of the sentence imposed on the former civilian intelligence analyst as a gross injustice			1
a major turning point in perception of the case came when a former @entity14 assistant secretary of defense made an explosive accusation about why @entity13 is serving a life sentence			1
@entity46 , who worked in the @entity47 when @entity13 's crime came to light , wrote a letter to president @entity50 urging @entity13 's release			2
" i can say with confidence , " he told the president , " that the severity of @entity13 's sentence is a result of an almost visceral dislike of @entity1 ... on the part of my boss at the time , secretary of defense @entity58			1
" as the 59 - year - old @entity13 languishes in prison and his health reportedly deteriorates , his plight has gained enormous emotional power , turning him into a valuable negotiating chip			1
not everyone in @entity1 agrees that he should be released			0
and many @entity14 @entity66 are also deeply uncomfortable with the prominent place that @entity13 has assumed in relations between the @entity14 and @entity1			1
after all , @entity13 did commit a crime			0
still , his spying , as a recently declassified @entity72 damage assessment showed , aimed to collect information not about the @entity14 , but about weapons systems in the hands of @entity77 states , @entity78 and the @entity79 if @entity13 were released after 29 years in prison for a crime that did not harm @entity14 -- in fact , it harmed @entity1 and its relations with @entity85 -- no one would argue he was not punished for his crime			1
releasing pollard would constitute a low - cost effort to keep the peace talks alive and give @entity31 enough room to make politically unpopular decisions at home			1
@entity11 , whose plate is overflowing with other crises , has invested an astonishing amount of time to bring @entity1 and @entity2 together , with no sign of a loss of enthusiasm or erosion of earnestness			1
his original goal , a peace deal before the end of this month , will not occur			0
still , he would like to extend the talks			0
the @entity2 say they will walk out of the talks and refuse to extend them unless @entity1 frees 26 more jailed @entity2 , a fourth round of releases , which have included men convicted of murdering @entity1			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity31 , who had agreed to the releases as part of the current talks , says he will not free any more unless the @entity2 promise not to walk away from peace negotiations			1
the talks are in the middle of a thick logjam			0
and , if that were not depressing enough , the logjam is just about whether or not to continue talking			0
the sad reality is that there is no sign that any tangible progress has been made on the core issues			0
during the recent meeting of the @entity126 , @entity77 leaders disagreed about practically everything , but they came together in their rejection of accepting @entity1 as a jewish state			0
@entity2 doubt that @entity1 ever intend to relinquish any territory in the @entity28 for a @entity2 state , and @entity1 doubt that @entity2 are genuinely willing to accept @entity1 's existence as the state of the @entity66 people			2
each side is deeply skeptical of the other 's true intentions , even as majorities of both @entity2 and @entity1 say they support a negotiated agreement leading to a peace agreement and a two - state solution			1
if there is any good news , it is that throughout all the failures of peace - making , the popular desire for a negotiated solution has survived			0
despite the high obstacles , the peacemakers know that without negotiations , lasting peace can not come			0
and that 's where @entity13 comes in			0
the scraggly man who has spent decades in a prison could become the instrument of yet another round of negotiations , allowing @entity1 to free more palestinians			2
that might just be the worst punishment for him			0
@entity13 is reported to be adamantly opposed to what he calls a " shameful deal			2
" every release of prisoners is a triumph for @entity168 and a wound for @entity31			2
@entity1 cringe when they see the celebrations greeting @entity2 men who have spilled @entity1 blood			2
they seethe at articles in the foreign media that speak of how @entity1 " demonize " @entity2 convicted of murdering @entity1 , and they feel betrayed knowing those same men have received salaries from the @entity177 while serving their sentences in @entity1 prisons			2
the pressure from the @entity1 hardliners is building on @entity31			2
deputy defense minister @entity182 said @entity2 are tricking @entity1 , with no intention of ever making peace with @entity1 , just so they can free more prisoners			1
@entity182 says he will resign if a fourth round of releases goes through			0
@entity2 accuse @entity31 of reneging on a deal			1
amid charges and recriminations from both sides , @entity11 just made another rushed trip to the region , seeking to salvage what has increasingly come to be seen as his peace process			2
the idea of freeing @entity13 has come up several times before , at times of crisis in the process			0
each time the plan has fallen apart			0
@entity13 remains in prison and peace between @entity1 and @entity2 remains barely a dream			1
but , as stubborn optimists know , things stay the same until they change .			0

@entity14 may release the spy @entity13 as a chip in @entity209 negotiations
@entity211 : the move could give @entity31 political *leverage* in @entity1
she says if a deal is reached , @entity1 - @entity2 talks can continue through 2015
@entity219 : @entity13 has nothing to do with peace process , but his release makes sense
