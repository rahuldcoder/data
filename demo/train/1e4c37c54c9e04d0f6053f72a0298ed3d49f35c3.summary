@entity0 -- when president @entity3 headed to the @entity4 this week to tout the recovery effort from @entity6 , congressional @entity2 sought to keep the nation 's focus on @entity0			1
on the same day @entity3 played " @entity18 " with @entity12 gov. @entity11 on the @entity14 boardwalk and urged @entity15 to come spend money in the devastated region , @entity10 @entity2 committee leaders ensured that a series of controversies dominating the start of the president 's second term remained in the headlines			1
@entity3 quoted from the @entity26 song " @entity28 " popularized by local hero @entity27 , while @entity2 officials announced subpoenas of @entity32 records involving last year 's deadly @entity34 terrorist attack , questioned if attorney general @entity35 lied to @entity36 about cracking down on journalists and announced another congressional hearing on @entity40 targeting of conservative groups			1
and on friday , @entity3 stood in the @entity42 to push @entity36 to extend student loan rates that are set to double on july 1 if the @entity10 and @entity2 ca n't strike a deal			1
it 's all part of a high - stakes showdown over political messaging , with the @entity10 trying to shift the focus from the controversies that @entity2 seek to emphasize in their efforts to retain their @entity10 majority and perhaps win control of the @entity53 in next year 's congressional elections			1
" voters react against what they perceive to be excess and overkill , " said @entity2 pollster @entity55 , who noted that recent polls show the public believes one of the current controversies -- the @entity40 targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status -- amounted to government overreach			1
" any political party that overreaches usually gets slapped back by the public , " she added , referring to losses suffered by parties in power in mid-term elections in 1994 , 2006 and 2010			0
the @entity2 narrative depicts a government gone wild , with party leaders and strategists accusing the @entity3 administration of routinely abusing its powers			1
to bolster their argument , they lump the three controversies together in an effort to create a sweeping example of leaders avoiding accountability and responsibility			0
the failures for which @entity3 will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration , " @entity2 strategist @entity90 , a @entity1 contributor , recently wrote in an opinion piece			1
" they are the failures of an old idea -- that big , old , dumb , top - down , factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times			0
" rep. @entity99 of @entity100 , the 2012 @entity2 vice presidential nominee , complained of " an arrogant abuse of power " by the president			2
" now in his second term , now that he 's implementing his agenda , we are seeing big government in practice , " the @entity104 chairman said wednesday on @entity105			0
asked if the controversies would bring @entity2 victories in next year 's congressional elections to take control of the @entity53 while retaining their majority in the @entity10 , @entity99 said it was " just way too premature to make a comment like that			1
" @entity10 emphasizes business as usual for his part , @entity3 seemed to acknowledge his political troubles at a fundraiser on wednesday night in @entity122 , telling supporters that " sometimes we take a bad turn , sometimes we make mistakes			2
" at the same time , the president complained of " obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism " by political foes who appeared interested " only in scoring political points or placating a base , as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the @entity15 people			0
" " we 've got to figure out a way to work around that , " he continued , declaring that the solution would be for @entity138 to regain majority control in the @entity10 next year			2
@entity3 's schedule this week demonstrated how the @entity10 took a " business as usual " approach that emphasized low - risk issues for the president , such as tuesday 's visit to @entity12 for a bipartisan review of recovery efforts with @entity11 , a leading @entity2			1
the joint appearance benefited both men by portraying them as reasonable leaders able to work with political foes on major issues such as responding to a crisis like last year 's storm			2
other events on the president 's agenda included two @entity122 fundraisers and remarks at an @entity162 and @entity163 at the @entity10 , all following last week 's major speech on security issues including @entity15 drone policy and closing the @entity169 detention facility that houses terror suspects			0
despite the @entity10 efforts to shift the focus from the @entity0 controversies , wednesday 's briefing with reporters by chief spokesman @entity173 showed the difficulty			0
while the first questions were about other matters -- a reported drone strike , the @entity182 civil war and cyber-security issues with @entity184 -- @entity1 's @entity185 then asked about @entity2 accusations that @entity35 may have lied to @entity36 about the secret subpoenas and search warrants obtained by the @entity189 in recent years for information from journalists involved in reporting classified information			1
reporters from @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity105 quickly followed up on the same topic , forcing @entity173 to defend @entity35 and reiterate @entity3 's confidence in him			2
on thursday , @entity10 spokesman @entity198 told reporters aboard @entity199 from @entity122 that @entity3 would later attend his annual hurricane season briefing			2
he then faced more questions about @entity35 , with @entity198 expressing @entity3 's confidence that the controversies would not affect the attorney general 's ability to do his job			2
@entity2 singles out @entity35 @entity2 have taken particular aim at @entity35 , an old nemesis from his days in the @entity209 administration who has been a political lightning rod in the @entity3 administration			1
he was cited for contempt of @entity213 last year in a dispute over documents related to the botched " @entity217 " gun - walking operation			0
@entity35 rejected the vote boycotted by most @entity138 as political theater			2
critics now seek to link him to two cases stemming from @entity189 investigations of classified leaks -- one involving secret subpoenas last year of phone records of @entity86 journalists , and the other about subpoenas and search warrants obtained in secret three years ago for phone records , e-mails and security badge details of @entity105 correspondent @entity233			2
some @entity2 attempt to group the classified leaks cases with the other controversies -- @entity40 targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points from the administration four days after the terrorist attack in @entity34 , @entity241 , last september that killed the @entity15 ambassador and three other @entity15			1
" i think it is time for mr. @entity35 to step aside , " @entity243 rep. @entity243 of @entity244 told @entity245 on wednesday			0
" we need a new attorney general , especially with all of these matters that are now going to need investigation from the @entity40 to the @entity189 treatment of reporters			2
i just do n't think he is in a position where he can do that in a way that the @entity15 people expect			0
" @entity3 and @entity138 joined @entity2 in condemning the @entity40 targeting , which is under investigation by congressional committees as well as @entity35 's @entity189			1
the classified leaks investigations also raised concern among @entity138 including @entity3 , who ordered @entity35 to conduct a review of how the government investigates such cases			1
however , @entity267 strategist @entity266 , a @entity1 political contributor , described @entity2 calls for @entity35 to resign as overkill , noting that @entity2 legislators had demanded an investigation into classified leaks in the first place			0
" i think that if the president took action every time a @entity10 @entity2 criticized a member of his cabinet , we 'd have a pretty empty government , " @entity266 said when asked if @entity35 was proving a liability to @entity3			1
" ... for average @entity15 , they 're not really paying attention to this and they 're wondering , you know , why should n't the @entity189 investigate , you know , intelligence leaks about some of our most pressing national security issues ? " public responds to @entity40 a @entity292 poll released thursday appeared to back up some of @entity266 's assertion			2
according to the survey , 44 % of registered voters responded that the @entity40 probe of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status was the most important of the controversies facing the @entity3 administration , while 24 % said the handling of the @entity34 attack was the biggest concern			1
only 15 % called the @entity189 's seizure of journalists ' phone records as the most important			0
by contrast , 73 % of respondents said the economy was a higher priority than the three controversies , according to the survey			0
however , it also showed that more than three - quarters of respondents wanted a special prosecutor -- rather than @entity35 -- to investigate the @entity40 targeting			0
to liberal political analyst @entity319 , republicans have attacked @entity35 as part of a broader strategy to tarnish the administration			0
" @entity324 as the font of secrecy , manipulation and wrongdoing in the @entity3 administration will be played and replayed in the run - up to the 2014 elections , " @entity319 wrote thursday on his website			1
" the aim will be to paint @entity35 as an incompetent , conniving political hack who supposedly typifies the poor and untrustworthy judgment of @entity3 in picking his political appointees			0
" @entity336 , the @entity2 pollster , argued that the controversies all started with problematic acts by the administration			1
" it 's an advantage to the party out of power if the party in power is seen to be obfuscating or hiding the truth , " she said , noting that " these are not investigations that began in ( @entity2 house speaker ) @entity350 's office			0
" @entity351 , a @entity352 constitutional lawyer , noted that most recent presidents faced accusations if not outright evidence of scandal in their second terms			0
in the @entity3 administration , @entity351 said , @entity35 serves the role of " sin - eater , " or " people that would take your sins away for a price			1
" " @entity35 is the ultimate sin - eater in the beltway , " @entity351 argued on @entity1			0
" he protects the president and he has an important use in that sense			0
" @entity1 's @entity370 and @entity371 contributed to this report .			0
