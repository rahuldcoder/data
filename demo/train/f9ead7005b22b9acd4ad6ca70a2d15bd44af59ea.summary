-- until two centuries ago , ice was just an unfortunate side effect of winter			1
but in the early 1800s , one man saw dollar signs in frozen ponds			0
the ice industry pulls in $ 2.5 billion a year , but it 's nowhere near as dominant as it used to be			1
@entity8 not only introduced the world to cold glasses of water on hot summer days , he created a thirst people never realized they had			1
in 1805 , two wealthy brothers from @entity15 , @entity16 , were at a family picnic , enjoying the rare luxuries of cold beverages and ice cream			1
they joked about how their chilled refreshments would be the envy of all the colonists sweating in the @entity24			1
it was a passing remark , but it stuck with one of the brothers			1
his name was @entity8 , and 30 years later , he would ship nearly 200 tons of ice halfway around the globe to become the " @entity32			1
" ice man cometh nothing in @entity8 's early years indicated that he would invent an industry			1
he had the pedigree to attend @entity37 but dropped out of school at the age of 13			0
after loafing for a few years , he retired to his family 's country estate to hunt , fish , and play at farming			0
when his brother , @entity44 , quipped that they should harvest ice from the estate 's pond and sell it in the @entity24 , @entity8 took the notion seriously			1
after all , he had little else to do			0
@entity8 convinced @entity44 to join him in a scheme to ship ice from @entity53 to the @entity54			1
@entity8 reasoned that once people tried it , they 'd never want to live without it			0
during the next six months , the brothers pooled their money and laid out plans to ship their product to the @entity64 island of @entity65 , where they hoped to create a monopoly on ice			1
no one believed the idea would work			0
in fact , no ship in @entity15 would agree to transport the unusual cargo , so @entity8 spent nearly $ 5,000 ( a big chunk of the seed money ) buying a ship of his own			1
on february 10 , 1806 , the @entity78 reported , " no joke			1
a vessel with a cargo of 80 tons of ice has cleared out from this port for @entity65			2
we hope this will not prove to be a slippery speculation			0
although the ice arrived in @entity65 in perfect condition , no one wanted to buy it			2
@entity8 desperately explained how the cold blocks of ice could be used in the stifling @entity54 heat , but islanders were n't convinced			1
after an inauspicious start , @entity44 pulled out of the partnership			0
the following winter , @entity8 was on his own			0
remarkably , he drummed up enough money to send another shipment of ice to the @entity24			2
but when a trade embargo left much of the @entity54 off limits for two years , @entity8 was left twiddling his thumbs			1
meanwhile , the @entity8 family fortune had dwindled in a shady real estate deal in @entity15			1
despite financial woes , @entity8 persisted , and his ice business finally turned a profit in 1810			2
but a series of circumstances -- including war , weather , and relatives needing bailouts -- kept him from staying in the black for too long			0
between 1809 and 1813 , he landed in debtors ' prison three times and spent the rest of the time hiding from the sheriff			0
@entity0 : @entity122 places on @entity123 breaking the ice perhaps it was his yankee entrepreneurial spirit , or perhaps monomania , but @entity8 was obsessed with the idea that ice would make him rich			2
during the next decade , he developed clever new techniques to convince people that they actually needed ice , including a " first one 's free " pitch			2
while living in a @entity136 boarding house in 1819 , @entity8 made a habit of bringing a cooler of chilled beverages to the dinner table			2
his fellow boarders always scoffed at the sight , but after a sip or two , they 'd inevitably fall in love with his ice			2
@entity8 traveled around the country and convinced barkeeps to offer chilled drinks at the same price as regular drinks -- to see which would become more popular			2
he also taught restaurants how to make ice cream , and reached out to doctors and hospitals to convince them that ice was the perfect way to cool feverish patients			2
the truth is that people never knew they needed ice until @entity8 made them try it			2
once they did , they could n't live without it			0
by 1821 , @entity8 's business was strengthening			0
he 'd created real demand for his product in @entity166 , @entity167 ; @entity168 , @entity136 ; @entity169 , @entity170 ; and even @entity171 , @entity172			0
but he still needed to refine his operation			0
enter @entity175 , an innovator who became @entity8 's foreman in 1826			0
by using a horse - drawn plow to cut the ice into large grids , @entity175 invented a much faster harvesting method			1
he also put an assembly process into place			0
laborers sawed the blocks apart and plunked them into canals to float them downstream			0
then a conveyor belt would hoist the blocks from the water and carry them up to icehouses , where they 'd be stacked up to 80 feet high			0
still , only one - tenth of the ice harvested made it to sale			1
what 's worse , the whole operation was incredibly unsafe			0
in addition to those towering stacks of ice , numb hands , sharp instruments , and frigid waters made the process dangerous			2
the 300 - lb. blocks of ice could slide easily , knocking down men and breaking their limbs			1
ice harvesters often developed " ice man 's knees , " which were bruised and bloody from days of shoving solid ice			2
@entity0 : people whose jobs actually killed them despite these drawbacks , @entity175 's ingenious methods were a major improvement on prior harvesting practices			0
with the inventor by his side , @entity8 asserted his long - fomenting monopoly and became known as the " @entity32			2
" @entity8 's reputation solidified in 1833 when he shipped 180 tons of ice halfway across the world to @entity226 colonists in @entity227			2
the venture was so successful that it reopened trade routes between @entity230 and @entity15			1
back at home , @entity8 continued to dominate the scene			0
by 1847 , nearly 52,000 tons of ice traveled by ship or train to 28 cities across the @entity237			0
nearly half the ice came from @entity15 , and most of that was @entity241 's			1
he also maintained ice - harvesting rights to key ponds throughout @entity16			1
even @entity245 watched @entity8 's workers harvest @entity247 and waxed philosophic about the scene in his diary : " the pure @entity247 water is mingled with the sacred water of the @entity253			0
" the end of the @entity255 @entity8 died in 1864 , finally rich again			0
by that time , everyone with access to a frozen body of water was in on the action			0
ice boomtowns sprouted along the @entity262 in @entity263 , where farmers found year - round employment			1
the 1860s became the peak competitive period of @entity237 ice harvesting , and @entity8 's company prospered			0
even during the @entity271 , when the south was cut off from ice supplies in the @entity274 , the ice industry continued to grow in @entity53 and in the @entity275			1
as @entity237 society grew more accustomed to fresh meats , milk , and fruit , the ice industry expanded into one of the most powerful industries in the nation			1
at the turn of the 20th century , nearly every family , grocer , and barkeep in @entity237 had an icebox			0
but ironically , @entity237 's dependence on ice created the very technology that would lead to the decline of the ice empire -- electric freezers and refrigerators			1
during the early 1900s , these appliances became more reliable , and by 1940 , 5 million units had been sold			0
with freezers allowing people to make ice at home , there was little need to ship massive quantities across the country			1
today , the ice industry pulls in $ 2.5 billion a year , but it 's nowhere near as dominant as it used to be			1
most of the business is from pre-packaged , direct - to - consumer ice ( the stuff you buy for your beer cooler )			1
@entity0 : blind genius invented cruise control still , that does n't mean we should n't be grateful			0
the next time you put your lips to a slushie , or an iced tea , or a chilled martini , or a cold beer on a hot day , take a moment to thank the crazy yankee who had the vision to turn water into money			1

unbelievably , ice was not a hot item in the blistering @entity54 of 1806
wealthy @entity15 brothers single - handedly invent ice industry
eventually , ice sales *skyrocket* , *re-opening* trade to @entity230 in 1830s
home freezers chilled the ice industry , but $ 2.5 billion worth still sold annually
