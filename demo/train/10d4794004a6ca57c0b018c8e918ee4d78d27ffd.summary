@entity0 -- a district attorney in @entity3 said thursday that the statute of limitations prohibits the filing of charges against a judge shown in a 2004 video repeatedly beating his then - teenage daughter			1
the daughter , meanwhile , told @entity1 's @entity12 she uploaded the graphic video as a way to reconcile with judge @entity15			1
" i wanted to show my father , ' hey , i think you were in some denial about the way you are treating me and my mother			1
' and maybe showing him this would make him see something he did n't before , " @entity21 , now 23 , told @entity1			1
@entity15 , a court - at - law judge in @entity25 , @entity3 , faces a judicial conduct probe over the incident			1
@entity25 district attorney @entity28 sent a letter to @entity31 police chief @entity30 thursday evening , informing him of his decision on prosecution			1
" it is clear that no criminal misdemeanor information nor any criminal felony indictment may be presented for any criminal charge that may be depicted on the subject video , " @entity28 wrote			2
" limitations prevent prosecution of any applicable criminal charge shown on said video			1
" @entity31 police said they would contact federal authorities to determine whether any criminal charges may be filed in federal court			1
earlier , @entity28 said authorities were looking at numerous factors , including the child 's age and the statute of limitations			1
the law is complex on which charges could be brought , he said , and which statutes may apply -- all speculation until the video is confirmed to be authentic			1
a criminal defense lawyer said it was not likely that @entity15 could be prosecuted			2
in an offense involving injury to a child , @entity3 law defines a child as being 14 years or less , said @entity66 lawyer @entity65			2
@entity21 was 16 in the video			2
@entity30 said the statute of limitations for felony injury to a child is five years			1
the video shows the judge whipping his daughter with a belt , cursing at her and berating her			1
the 2004 beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the @entity78 " to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time , " @entity21 wrote on the internet posting			1
she said she released the video after being harassed by her father			1
@entity21 ' comments to " @entity86 " came shortly after @entity15 said she posted the video after he warned this year he might reduce financial support to her			1
" if the public must know , just prior to the @entity91 upload , a concerned father shared with his 23 - year - old daughter that he was unwilling to continue to work hard and be her primary source of financial support , if she was going to simply ' drop out , ' and strive to achieve no more in life than to work part - time at a video game store , " the judge said in a statement			1
@entity15 said @entity21 told him that if he " reduced her financial support , and took away her @entity103 automobile , which her father had provided , he would live to regret it			1
the post was then uploaded			2
" asked on " @entity86 " to respond , @entity21 said , " i think that 's a perfect example of the way he would always twist stories in our community to make him come out as the good guy			2
" she said her father , while assisting , was not her primary source of financial support			1
the father wrote @entity21 " inexplicably dropped out " two classes shy of completing her college studies			1
@entity21 and her mother , @entity118 , spoke with @entity12 about what they called a dysfunctional home where violence was a regular occurrence			1
the mother participated in the videotaped beating , but has since apologized			2
she said her former husband told her to help administer the punishment			2
" i thought he was a monster , " @entity118 said about her review of the video			0
" i thought that i was a witch			0
" @entity21 said she left her video camera on her dresser recording and covered its light with a scarf in order to capture the video			0
the video is punctuated by cracks of the man 's belt and the girl 's screams and cries			0
at one point in the 7 1/2 - minute video , the man says to his near - hysterical daughter , " what happened to you , @entity21 ? once you were an obedient , nice little girl			1
now you lie , cheat and steal			0
" he yells at her , " you want to put some more computer games on ? you want some more ? " " are you happy ? " he asks her			0
" disobeying your parents ? you do n't deserve to f --- ing be in this house			0
" he also berates the girl 's mother for allowing a " f --- ing computer " in the house			0
the older woman also strikes the girl with a belt once , and near the end of the video instructs the girl not to " touch one other thing on the computer besides your schoolwork until you are given notice otherwise			0
" asked whether @entity15 , who handles family - related and juvenile court issues , should oversee such matters , @entity21 said , " i do n't think he 's fit for the position			0
" but she was worried about him losing his job			0
" i really do n't know what the solution for him is , " she told @entity12			1
" except that i really want him to seek some kind of help			0
" her father questioned her motives and timing			1
" perhaps @entity21 should explain , if she felt she was raised by a tyrannical father , a claim shared with no one until five years after adulthood , why she insisted on living with her father and not her mother from the time of her parent 's divorce , until she moved out on her own , " @entity15 said			1
" @entity21 has been living on her own for some time , and has been an adult for almost six years , so why post the video in late 2011 ? " meanwhile , the state commission of @entity203 was inundated with calls , e-mails and faxes , it said in an online statement announcing the start of a probe into the matter			0
@entity25 attorney @entity211 said his office was also overwhelmed with calls and e-mails , including some from overseas , since the video went viral on the @entity78			1
" just a sad day			0
it 's unfortunate for all the people in that video			0
it does n't bode well for the image of our community or our judiciary or our legal community in @entity25 , " @entity211 said			0
@entity15 was temporarily relieved of his duties for the next two weeks , and a visiting judge will take over his caseload while the matter is being investigated , according to the office of @entity25 administrative judge @entity230			2
in an interview with @entity232 outside his @entity31 , @entity3 , home wednesday , @entity15 confirmed to a reporter that he was the man beating his daughter with a belt and a board on the video			2
" she 's mad because i 've ordered her to bring the car back , in a nutshell , but yeah , that 's me			0
i lost my temper , " @entity15 told the station			0
" her mother was there , she was n't hurt ... it was a long time ago ... i really do n't want to get into this right now because as you can see my life 's been made very difficult over this child			0
" @entity15 continued : " in my mind i have not done anything wrong other than discipline my child when she was caught stealing			0
i did lose my temper , i 've apologized			0
it looks worse than it is			0
" @entity15 told @entity256 that the conduct is " not as bad as it looks on tape			2
" the judge said he had contacted judicial review officials in @entity261 and " more will come out " in the investigation , @entity256 reported			2
whether @entity15 will face consequences for beating his daughter remains to be seen			2
but he will have to face the public three years from now , when he is up for re-election			0
" i do n't want to see my father prosecuted , " @entity21 told @entity1			2
" i do n't want to see him punished by the law because i think he 's been punished enough by all this			0
what i really think needs to happen is that we need to get him help			0
