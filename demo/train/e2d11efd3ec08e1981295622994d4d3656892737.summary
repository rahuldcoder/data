" you 're listening to @entity1			1
" the cheery jingle on the radio reminds you of a different time in this part of eastern @entity5 , a different world that existed before march 11 , 2011			0
driving past houses that residents can no longer call home , you can still see sandbags holding down tarpaulins on damaged roofs			2
they 're the result of the devastating earthquake and tsunami more than two years ago , and repairs the owners have not yet been able to carry out			2
we 're inside the original 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) exclusion zone , an area completely evacuated after the tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems for three reactors at the @entity26 nuclear plant , causing them to melt down and emit radioactive material			1
residents can now return to certain parts of the outer exclusion zone but only during the day			1
the government does not want to run the risk of accumulative radiation exposure if people stay for a full 24 hours			0
by the side of the road we pass along , teams of workers are clearing the ground of radiation and have been since the summer of 2011			0
it 's a colossal task that involves painstakingly removing the top layer of soil and grass to remove as much absorbed radiation as possible			0
the government - funded operation will have cost $ 1.5 billion by the end of this fiscal year , according to the @entity5 government			2
on any given day up to 8,000 people are working on the clean - up around @entity54			2
more than a year ago , the workers here wore full protection suits , today they simply wear gloves and the basic face masks you can see anywhere in @entity5 -- a sign that the radiation level here has dropped			0
thousands of industrial - size black bags hold the contaminated soil			0
they are lined up in fields , waiting for their final resting place -- wherever that may be			0
this is a reminder that the problem of what to do with radioactive water at the crippled @entity1 plant is not the only storage issue this country has to deal with			1
during the day , the steady volume of traffic in this outer part of the exclusion zone belies the invisible threat that still exists			1
it 's a threat that two - and - a - half years later has residents wondering when , or even if , they will be able to move back home .			1

@entity88 to clean up *irradiated* areas around @entity1 nuclear plant continues
original 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) exclusion zone around crippled *facility* remains
residents only allowed access to outer parts of this area for *limited* *periods*
new radioactive leaks at plant continue to cause *concern* two and a half years on
