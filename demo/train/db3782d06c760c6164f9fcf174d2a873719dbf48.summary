@entity0 still remembers well the dimensions of his cell : 6 x 9 x 12 feet			2
there was a steel bed and a sink that doubled as a toilet where he would also wash clothes			2
@entity0 spent 29 years in solitary confinement in @entity10			1
he has been free since 2001 , but still has difficulty with geographical orientation			2
" i get confused as to where i am , where i should be , " he said			2
@entity0 joined researchers and legal experts at the @entity16 annual meeting in @entity18 this month to talk about the mental and physical health consequences of solitary confinement			1
" the widespread consensus among mental health professionals is that solitary confinement , for the overall majority of mentally ill prisoners , places them at severe risk of additional harm , " said @entity22 , director of the program in legal studies at the @entity25 , @entity25			1
this week , @entity35 agreed to several changes that would limit the use of solitary confinement for disciplining some groups of inmates , including those under 18 or pregnant women			1
the agreement stemmed from a class - action lawsuit			1
the @entity35 @entity45 provided to @entity46 a statement from its acting commissioner , which read in part : " these are important reforms that will make the disciplinary practices in @entity35 's prisons more humane , and ultimately , our state 's criminal justice system more fair and progressive , while maintaining safety and security			1
" a department spokesperson said no statement was available on the general use of solitary confinement			1
a brief history of solitary confinement there are about 80,000 people being held in some sort of solitary - type confinement in the @entity69 , @entity22 said			1
prisoners in solitary confinement tend to be restricted to cells of 80 square feet , not much larger than a king - size bed , @entity22 said			1
sleeping , eating and defecating all take place inside that space			2
for exercise , prisoners in solitary confinement often get a short time in a cage rather than an outdoor yard -- perhaps one hour per day			1
@entity22 , who has studied prisons and punishment for more than four decades , estimates that about one - third of people in solitary confinement in this country are mentally ill , although some prison systems do not permit mentally ill inmates to be placed in solitary confinement			1
solitary confinement was used broadly in the 19th century , but the punishment was then largely abandoned because of the view that " it was doing more harm than good , " @entity22 said			1
correctional practice began to reincorporate solitary confinement in the late 1970s and 80s , as prisons began to get overcrowded , @entity22 said			1
he believes prison systems turned to solitary confinement as a short - term solution to controlling disruptive or violent behavior , lacking the resources to provide positive incentives or programming			1
but overcrowding in prisons turned out to be permanent and mostly increased each year			2
prison systems continued to struggle over what to do to resolve conflicts or stop violence or disruption in the institutions			2
they put more prisoners in solitary confinement and left them there for longer periods of time , @entity22 said			1
" i think the cost of solitary confinement is now being critically examined and rethought , and prison systems are beginning to ask themselves whether this is worth it , and whether or not it does not create more harm than good , " he said			1
" courts are pushing them to consider the inhumanity of the practice , as well			2
" ' @entity126 was n't in me ' @entity0 noticed six months into his time in solitary confinement that his eyesight significantly worsened -- he thinks because his eyes had become acclimated to such short distances in his cell			1
over time , he retrained his eyes so that he would not be so nearsighted , he said			2
eye problems are not uncommon in these circumstances			2
in fact , @entity136 , professor at the @entity137 , said there is a swath of cataract surgeries at @entity126 in @entity142			0
@entity143 represents more than 1,000 prisoners at @entity126 in a lawsuit alleging that keeping prisoners in such conditions -- isolated in small , windowless cells with no physical contact or phone calls -- violates the @entity151 and international law because it is " cruel and inhumane			1
" @entity0 , who was freed when his conviction was overturned 13 years ago , said his mental health suffered , too , but he knew others were faring worse and he was determined to not let that happen to himself			0
" i was depressed every day i was in prison , " he said			0
" i wanted to get out			0
i was in prison , convicted for a crime i did n't commit			0
of course i was depressed			0
" initially , food was served to him on a tray under the door to his cell ; sometimes the tray was flung onto the floor with its contents spilled			0
@entity0 said he and other inmates filed a redress and went on hunger strikes until they negotiated that holes would be cut in bars to serve the food in a more sanitary way			0
he said he and others also filed a lawsuit so that the prison would give them the opportunity for outdoor exercise			0
@entity0 could talk to other prisoners through the walls or by sliding notes			1
" what helped me weather the storm was : i was in prison , but prison was n't in me , " he said			0
what it 's like solitary confinement has been associated with many different physical and psychological ills			1
" when isolated prisoners are asked , they point to anger , hatred , bitterness , boredom , stress , loss of the sense of reality , suicidal thoughts , trouble sleeping , impaired concentration , confusion , depression , and hallucinations , " writes @entity189 of the @entity190 in an essay published by @entity192			1
several studies point to headaches , heart palpitations , increased pulse and oversensitivity to stimuli as symptoms of isolated prisoners , @entity189 wrote , as well as dizziness , loss of appetite and weight loss			1
most studies on the topic have found depression and anxiety among isolated inmates , @entity189 wrote			0
a study on the @entity227 jail system published this month in the @entity228 found that those who had been in solitary confinement at least once had a higher likelihood of self - harm			1
@entity22 said identity disorders have also been found among isolated prisoners because of the loss of contact with the social world			1
" people have to structure their lives around the absence of other human beings , " he said			2
" they [ prisoners in solitary confinement ] go for years on end without touching anyone with affection			1
" typically people released from solitary confinement do n't get much help transitioning out of it , he said			1
some systems parole prisoners directly out of their isolated cells			2
@entity136 argued at the @entity16 conference that social interaction and sensory stimulation form a basic human need , as supported by science			0
research has shown people outside of prison who are socially isolated also have a higher risk of heart attacks , hypertension , concentration and memory problems , he said			1
" we 're trying to integrate law and science in this , " he said			0
solitary confinement and the brain there are n't any direct brain - imaging studies of people who are in solitary confinement because of access issues , @entity271 , a neuroscientist at the @entity272 , said at the @entity16 conference			1
but available studies on similar situations suggest significant brain changes could be occurring			0
positive experiences , including social interaction , have positive impacts on the brain , such as the activation of molecules called growth factors , which are akin to fertilizers for brain cells , helping them regrow and interact			0
" depriving people of that is physically depriving the brain from its nourishment , " she said			2
without any social interaction , some people hallucinate or become explosive in their emotions , she said			2
an absence of sunlight and being out of sync with the daily rhythm could produce negative effects by itself , she said			0
several studies on shift workers have found associations with various medical conditions			0
severe depression has profound impacts on the brain ; autopsies have shown that " the orchestration of brain and activity of genes in their brains is messed up " in such patients , she said			0
it 's a vicious cycle : you feel bad , that produces stress , stress hurts the brain , and that makes you feel bad , @entity271 said			0
chronic depression and stress have been associated with a shrinking of the hippocampus , a seahorse - shaped brain area critical for memory , spatial recognition and controlling one 's emotions , @entity271 said			2
studies have shown that the longer the depression goes untreated , the more the hippocampus shrinks			0
" when @entity0 [ @entity0 ] tells you that he gets disoriented physically , i can tell him that people who are chronically depressed have a shrunken hippocampus , and that that affects your ability to orient in space , in @entity343 , " she said			2
@entity0 told @entity46 after the conference that this brain atrophy could be what is happening to him			0
" the brain somehow wo n't register things , and it wo n't register exactly where i am , " he said			0
the @entity349 3 @entity0 was one of three inmates known as the " @entity351 " who protested what they said were injustices at the @entity349 at @entity349			0
the three spent decades isolated in cells for 23 hours a day			0
the other two , @entity351 and @entity351 , were convicted in the 1972 killing of a guard at the @entity349 prison			0
@entity351 died just days after being released from prison in october 2013 at age 71			0
" his legacy will endure through a civil lawsuit that he filed jointly with his fellow @entity349 3 members , @entity351 and @entity0 , " rep. @entity360 , @entity361 , said in october			0
" that lawsuit seeks to define and abolish long - term solitary confinement as cruel and unusual punishment			1
" former ' @entity351 ' inmate dies days after release @entity371 remains in prison , where he has been in solitary confinement for more than 41 years			1
@entity374 has called for his release			0
@entity0 was convicted in 1973 of killing a fellow inmate , although he believes he was " being punished for being a member of the @entity378			0
" he was transferred to @entity349 weeks after the security guard was killed , but was investigated as a possible conspirator in the slaying			0
today , @entity0 serves as an adviser to @entity383 , an online project devoted to news , firsthand accounts and research and reporting on solitary confinement			1
he has also campaigned for the release of the other two members of the " @entity349 3			0
" @entity0 writes on his website : " i may be free from @entity349 , but @entity349 will never be free of me			0
