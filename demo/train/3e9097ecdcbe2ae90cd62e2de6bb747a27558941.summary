-- there was @entity3 fever as @entity4 won stage 18 of the @entity6 -- but it was @entity9 's @entity8 who extended his overall lead despite being handed a penalty			1
the famous @entity14 route asked more of the riders this year as , for the first time , the pack made a first ascent before descending back to the valley floor and then climbing the mountain for a second time			0
after an attacking ride , @entity8 fell foul of the energy - sapping conditions inside the last five kilometers of the 172 - km route			1
the @entity26 sent his @entity28 team - mate @entity27 back to the support car for food -- even though it is against the rules to ' feed ' inside the last 20 kilometers of a stage			1
race officials handed @entity8 a 20 - second penalty but the yellow jersey holder still stretched his lead over rival @entity39 to five minutes , 11 seconds			1
" @entity27 was feeling a lot better than i was and i was running out of sugars towards the end , " explained @entity8 , who is aiming to win his first @entity6 after helping sir @entity41 to the crown last year			1
" i had to ask him to go back and grab me some sugars from the car			0
" i was just getting in as best i could in those last few kilometers			0
i 'm not sure if it made any difference at that point in the race			0
" it 's a horrible feeling and i 'm just happy to have come out with more of an advantage than i had at the start of the stage			1
" this was definitely one of the harder days that we 've seen in this tour but i think that 's to be expected : two times up @entity14 and this late in the race , it 's definitely a hard day			2
" with three stages left to go before the @entity6 reaches its climax on the streets of the @entity3 capital , @entity39 must also find an extra burst of energy			1
the @entity70 was unable to respond when @entity8 pushed on twice during the second ascent			2
" i was n't on a good day , " said @entity39			2
" it was hot and very humid			0
but despite my setback i 've limited my losses			0
i hope to have better legs in the next few days			0
" the fans , many in colorful fancy - dress costumes , had squeezed along the stunning route despite the odd rain shower or two			0
@entity3 kisses they were rewarded with the first @entity3 stage winner on this year 's @entity6 as @entity4 picked off tiring @entity84 @entity83 inside the final two kilometers			1
" when i was about eight years old , i saw on the tv a victory of a cyclist at @entity14 and i hoped that one day maybe i could do it too , " @entity4 , who blew kisses to the crowd , said			1
" when i saw at the start of the climb that @entity83 attacked me i knew i could n't follow him			0
" three kilometers from the finish , i saw him and he did n't look good so i started to believe in my good stars			0
and i sprinted and the public supported me and i 'm in the sky ! " the riders must endure another test of stamina on stage 19 as they face a 204 - km rollercoaster ride through the mountains .			2

home crowd *celebrate* as the wait is over for first @entity3 winner on 2013 @entity6
