-- @entity1 is the world 's largest mobile phone trade show , held every year in @entity4			1
it is the venue for manufacturers like @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 to reveal the must - have mobile devices and services of the year			1
this year is likely to be no different with big launches expected from all the major players except @entity15			1
so what can we expect ? some phone makers have already announced their @entity1 line up , some have hinted , others have been rumored			1
talking to sources , joining the dots , and getting the word on the street , this is what is expected at the show : @entity7 @entity7 is rumored to be launching a number of handsets at @entity1 this year			1
some will focus on emerging markets ( @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 ) , while the others , the developed ones			0
the phones you are most likely to be interested in will be a @entity40 version of the recently announced @entity41 , and a low end @entity43 ; the @entity44			0
both models will work with @entity48 's @entity47 operating system			2
@entity8 we are expecting three handsets from the @entity52 company ; the @entity53 , the @entity54 , and the @entity55 the top - of - the - range one x will feature the new @entity58 quad - core processor and run @entity59 , while pocket - lint has confirmed with sources that the one v will be a music - focused device aimed at men and similar to the more female friendly ( if that is possible ) @entity66 that is already on the market			1
@entity10 although @entity10 was expected to launch the @entity69 at @entity1 this year , the company has now confirmed that it wo n't			1
with a number of @entity72 launches already detailed , @entity10 is expected instead to focus on tablets at the show			1
if rumors are to be believed , it will launch a 10.1 - inch version of the @entity77 announced in september 2011			0
the difference from all the other tablets it sells ? it will have a built - in stylus			2
@entity9 following @entity10 's lead with the @entity77 , @entity9 has announced its @entity84 prior to the show			1
a cross between a phone and a tablet , it will measure 139.6mm x @entity89 , meaning it 's going to be one for those with big hands and big pockets			0
there are also rumors that the company will announce a follow up to the @entity96 called the @entity97			0
expect it to have a quad - core processor too			0
@entity101 maker @entity100 has said that there will be no new hardware at the show this year , but that it will be showing off the new @entity106 operating system and the software operating system , @entity108 , that it hopes will power its new phones expected later in the year			0
@entity110 having just announced a new waterproof and dustproof phone called the @entity112 , @entity110 has also confirmed it has a second handset in the pipeline to launch at @entity1			2
it will feature a dual - core processor , @entity117 screen and will run @entity59			0
@entity118 @entity119 brand @entity118 has confirmed that it will be launching phones in @entity40 following its success in @entity119			0
the company has yet to announce which models it will be bringing the continent , however the smart money is on the waterproof quad - core @entity58 3 powered @entity59 smartphone it announced at @entity128 in @entity129 in january			0
@entity130 ( aka @entity131 ) trying to pinpoint a @entity130 phone destined for @entity1 is as hard as @entity131 's transitions to @entity130			1
we are expecting a @entity40 launch for the already announced ( at @entity128 ) @entity136 though			0
rumors and leaked internet photos suggest maybe a bigger screen version too , as well as an array of other @entity59 devices			0
@entity143 @entity143 's @entity1 plans are even quieter than @entity130 's with the company traditionally focusing on @entity128 in @entity129 to launch many of its first - half - of - the - year handsets			1
there is a suggestion that @entity143 has teamed up with @entity148 to launch one of the first @entity148 - powered smartphones , but that is still to be confirmed			2
@entity143 does n't have a press conference at the show , but @entity148 does .			2

@entity7 , @entity8 expected to lead a busy field for new mobile device launches at @entity1
@entity10 's @entity69 will remain under *wraps* as @entity160 manufacturer focuses on tablets
@entity130 and @entity143 's plans remain a *mystery* *ahead* of @entity4 event
