-- there are few more concrete examples of the longtime rift between @entity4 and @entity5 in @entity6 than the walled city on the @entity8			2
its official name , and the name used by most residents of the @entity13 , is @entity14			1
but @entity16 nationalists and @entity4 call it simply @entity14			1
the city was a flashpoint for the violent conflict between unionists and nationalists that swept @entity22 from the 1960s through the 1990s			2
its @entity25 and @entity5 children attend segregated schools			0
even today it 's not uncommon for road signs pointing motorists to @entity14 to have the " @entity31 " blacked out by graffiti			1
this weekend , however , @entity14 - @entity14 plays host to an event its organizers hope can help unite this divided city , at least for a few days			1
called @entity37 , it 's a four - day festival expected to attract tens of thousands of spectators to see the city 's historic cathedrals , walls , bridges and squares illuminated by splashes of light			1
projects range from led and neon sculptures to large - scale projections by leading artists and lighting designers from @entity6 and beyond			2
" it ( the city ) has been a contested space for a very long time			2
and we 're going there in the hope that ... maybe people who have n't felt comfortable standing next to each other in the streets will find an opportunity to do that , " said @entity55 , co-director of @entity56 , a @entity31 - based company that stages large - scale public events across the @entity13			1
" it may be a naive hope , but the hope is that communities who are divided by heritage or tradition or faith will find something new they can all enjoy together			2
" marriage knows what she 's talking about			1
in her eight years at @entity56 , which she co-founded with @entity77 , she has orchestrated numerous public , artistic spectacles in @entity31 and other cities			1
each have drawn throngs of people who packed the streets , faces bright with wonder , to witness their city be transformed if only for a moment into something magical			2
" i do n't exaggerate the power of what we do , " @entity55 told @entity0 during her recent appearance at the @entity90 conference , an annual gathering of artists , scientists and thought leaders in @entity95 , @entity96			1
" but the way people are moved by the work , and the way it makes them feel about their town , is something that 's hard to describe			2
you can absolutely feel it in the air			0
" the @entity109 in retrospect , the birth of @entity56 's first project was a minor miracle			1
in the early 2000s , @entity114 and @entity77 wanted to bring @entity115 , a @entity116 street - theater company , to @entity31 to mount a spectacle in the streets with enormous marionettes acting out a fanciful story about a young girl and a time - traveling elephant			1
marriage had to persuade skeptical city officials to shut down parts of central @entity31 and reroute traffic while convincing them the event was n't just a piece of frivolous disruption			1
" you can imagine sitting in front of 25 gentlemen in various uniforms and suits , and saying , ' hey guys , it 's a kind of fairy story , about an elephant and a little girl			2
and we 'd like to shut the city ( down ) for four days , ' " she said			2
" a lot of them admitted afterwards that they thought we were mad			0
" this lobbying effort took marriage five years			2
" i used to go to these meetings and say , ' please , may i do this ? ' and then i realized i was asking the wrong question			0
if you say to somebody , ' please may i do this thing that 's a bit unusual , ' you 're placing them in a position where they have to authorize your unusual behavior			2
and of course their instinct is to say no , " she said			0
" so i said , ' this is happening , on these dates			0
how can you help me ? ' and immediately the response was different			0
because nobody was being asked to take responsibility for something they could n't possibly imagine			0
nobody ever really said yes			0
they just stopped saying no. " the event , " @entity109 , " was a huge success in may 2006			0
@entity177 , despite anxieties about crowded public spaces after the terrorist bombings that had rocked the city 10 months earlier , turned out in droves			1
crime in @entity31 plummeted that weekend , and the event -- funded by government arts agencies and private donors -- generated an estimated 28 million pounds to the city 's economy , @entity55 said			1
to her , the emotional impact was even greater			0
" people really took it to their hearts , " she said			0
" it 's always an incredible moment when the city is returned to the people who live and work there			1
and they can wander freely as if in a playground , for no better reason than something is happening that they love			0
the real point of it is to create a moment of magic and wonder in people 's lives			0
" plinthers and a @entity206 @entity56 's subsequent projects were smaller in scale but no less imaginative			1
in 2008 , they worked with @entity13 artist @entity210 to unveil the @entity206 , a fanciful contraption that claimed to link @entity31 and @entity212 by means of a transatlantic tunnel and lots of mirrors			1
thanks to a fast broadband connection , people in @entity31 could peer into the " tunnel " and see a live feed of @entity212 , and vice versa			0
thousands invested in the illusion that they were peeking through a subterranean scope at the other side of the world			0
marriage and her team followed that in 2009 with " @entity231 , " which took over @entity31 's @entity233 for 100 days and nights			1
the square 's famous monument to adm. @entity237 is flanked by four smaller plinths , or platforms -- one of which sits empty			0
so @entity56 turned it into a monument to living @entity244 by inviting people to be hoisted atop the plinth to do whatever they pleased for one hour			1
the rules : only one person would be allowed at a time , they could take up only what they could carry , and they could n't do anything illegal			0
more than 35,000 applied and the winners -- " plinthers , " they were called -- were picked randomly by lottery and assigned a time			0
the event began in july and ran for 2,400 hours , day and night , with a new person occupying the plinth each hour			0
many used their 60 minutes for performance art , others for tribute or protest			0
one man proposed to his girlfriend			0
" people used it in incredibly imaginative ways , " @entity55 said			1
" the summary of all of those hours became the artwork			0
it was sort of a portrait of a nation at that point in our history			0
" we always choose projects where we can insert the project itself into the dna of the city , " she continued			2
" we do n't work in galleries or opera houses or theaters			0
we work in the streets , using the buildings of the city , the architecture of the city , as the stage			0
" cities of light then came the first @entity37 festival , held in november 2009 in @entity303 , a small medieval city in northern @entity304			1
for four dark , wintry nights , @entity56 's artists transformed its cityscape of castles , stone walls and cobbled streets into gleaming spectacles of light			1
the festival proved so popular that it was repeated in 2011 and then again earlier this month , when an estimated 175,000 people came to view 22 installations across the city			2
the success of @entity37 in @entity303 inspired @entity114 to double down this year on the festival in @entity14 - @entity14			1
in planning the event , she and @entity56 were careful to embrace both @entity16 and @entity304 traditions and to include members from @entity25 and @entity5 communities			1
" many of the works that we have commissioned have been made to reflect on the city 's divided history and the current progress being made towards its shared future , " she said			1
at its simplest level , @entity37 invites people to come out and enjoy artworks specially designed for each nook and cranny of its historic host cities			2
whether the @entity14 - @entity14 festival , which closes sunday night , has a more profound , lasting impact remains to be seen			1
based on her experiences with past artichoke events , she believes " the simple act of sharing a newly imagined world leaves a lasting legacy in all those who experience it			0

@entity55 is co-director of @entity56 , a creative company that stages big public street events
the company 's newest project , a festival of illuminated art , is *underway* in the @entity13
@entity357 , called @entity37 , seeks to help unite divided @entity16 city of @entity14 - @entity14
