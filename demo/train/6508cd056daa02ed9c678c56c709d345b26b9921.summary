-- as an expression of hard power , they do n't come bigger or more fearsome than the @entity5 @entity4			1
the @entity7 's nuclear - powered aircraft carrier can base as many as 75 warplanes , has a combat load of 97,000 tons and is manned by 6,250 battle - ready crew			1
but as an expression of soft - power , the nimitz - class carrier is finding its influence in its @entity16 theater of operations goes far beyond the range of its fearsome arsenal as it assists the @entity21 relief operation -- known as @entity22 -- in the @entity23			1
equipped with everything from a 51 - bed hospital ward and an operating theater to dentists ' surgeries , according to @entity30 's defense , the @entity5 @entity4 is leading a flotilla of @entity7 support vessels in support of the effort			1
the projection of @entity37 power on the world stage , especially in the context of a humanitarian disaster such as @entity21 , represents a public relations goldmine for the @entity37 military , at a time when the @entity37 is perceived as losing influence in the region to @entity46			1
it may not be the only navy helping in the aftermath of the disaster -- @entity51 and @entity52 have both committed vessels to the relief effort -- but considering the @entity4 's traditional links with the @entity23 as a former colony ( and for many decades one of its most important strategic bases ) the relief effort has a special resonance			1
" the @entity37 extending its soft power in the region as well as directing the relief operation are not contradictory objectives , " @entity23 political analyst @entity61 told @entity0			1
" the @entity23 and the @entity37 , of course , have a long history so there is an expectation that they would help because they 've helped in previous chapters in our history			2
" he said even the region that is the focus of the relief effort -- eastern @entity81 province -- has special meaning for the @entity37 - @entity23 relationship			1
" this is the area where @entity86 's forces landed during @entity87 when he fulfilled the promise of returning to the @entity23 after ousting the @entity89			0
" but while there 's an expectation , there is also a gratefulness for this help			0
" criticism has been leveled at @entity46 for its ham - fisted handling of its relief contribution , initially pledging $ 100,000 in humanitarian support			1
although it later raised the amount to $ 1.6 million , analysts have said that it has allowed its spat with the @entity23 over the @entity104 -- claimed severally by @entity105 , the @entity23 , @entity46 , @entity106 and @entity107 -- to cloud its judgment			2
the donation , which does not meet even that of furniture store , @entity111 , which has pledged $ 2.7 million through its charitable foundations , has dented its global image at a time when @entity37 influence is seen as declining in the region as @entity46 steps into the breach			2
analysts say @entity46 has missed an opportunity to win hearts and minds though non-traditional forms of diplomacy of which the supply of emergency assistance can form a crucial component			0
" one reason @entity46 's efforts to develop its soft power have failed is the utilitarian way @entity131 approaches the rest of the world			2
instead of using culture , adept diplomacy and trashy movies to seduce other countries , @entity46 hands out cold , hard cash , " said analyst @entity134 in a recent @entity135			0
" all the investment poured into railways in @entity143 , tunnels in @entity145 , power grids in @entity147 , hydroelectric projects in @entity149 , bridges in @entity107 , roads in @entity152 , factories in @entity105 , airports in @entity155 , and mining rigs in @entity157 comes with a high cost			0
in return , @entity46 demands complete docility			0
that 's the message being sent to the @entity23 now			0
" meanwhile , the victims of @entity21 are happy to find help where they can			0
" if you are talking of those western allies aligned with the @entity37 then you have the same level of commitment to humanitarian aid , " @entity61 said			0
" the others , meaning these countries not so aligned to the @entity23 or those such as @entity46 that have issues with the @entity23 , are a bit more reticent			2
" but the main thing to remember is that they are giving aid			0

one of @entity7 's largest vessels , @entity5 @entity4 , is leading *typhoon* relief effort
as an expression of soft - power , the @entity180 is finding its influence in @entity16
@entity37 links with @entity23 as former colony means the relief effort has a special resonance
criticism has been leveled at @entity46 for its handling of its relief contribution
