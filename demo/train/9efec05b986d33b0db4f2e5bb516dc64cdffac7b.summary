-- a @entity2 satellite probing the mysterious disappearance of @entity10 " observed a suspected crash area at sea , " a @entity2 government agency said -- a potentially pivotal lead into what thus far has been a frustrating , fruitless search			1
@entity2 's @entity11 announced the discovery , including images of what it said were " three suspected floating objects			1
" the objects are n't small : 13 by 18 meters ( 43 by 59 feet ) , 14 by 19 meters ( 46 by 62 feet ) and 24 by 22 meters ( 79 feet by 72 feet )			1
for reference , the wingspan of an intact @entity19 like the one that disappeared is about 61 meters ( 200 feet ) , and the plane 's overall length is about 64 meters ( 210 feet )			1
the images were captured around 11 a.m. on march 9 , the day after the plane went missing , but were n't released until wednesday			1
the @entity2 agency gave coordinates of 105.63 east longitude , 6.7 north latitude , which would put it in waters northeast of where it took off in @entity34 , @entity35 , and south of @entity37 , near where the @entity38 meets the @entity40			1
" it 's where it 's supposed to be , " @entity41 , a former @entity42 managing director , told @entity0 's @entity43 , noting the " great skepticism " about reports the plane had turned around to go back over @entity35			1
" i think they 've got to get vessels and aircraft there as quickly as humanly possible			0
" this is n't the first time authorities have announced the discovery of objects or oil slicks that might be tied to aircraft			1
still , it is the latest and comes on the same day that officials , rather than narrowing the search area , more than doubled it from the day earlier to nearly 27,000 square nautical miles ( 35,000 square miles )			1
the vastness of the area and the limited details that authorities have given makes it hard to tell whether the spot that the satellite imagery captured has been searched			1
a @entity35 air force official , who is not authorized to speak to the media , did say thursday morning that its aircraft were heading to that area			2
@entity73 -- author of a book on @entity76 's @entity75 , which also mysteriously went missing before its remnants were found -- said having a search area of that size is immensely challenging			1
he compared it to trying to find something the size of a car or truck in @entity85 , then widening it to look for the same thing in all of @entity87			0
" it 's a very , very difficult situation to try to find anything , " @entity73 told @entity0 's @entity88			2
" looking for pieces on the shimmering water does n't make it any easier			0
" the @entity2 satellite find could help , significantly , in that regard			1
" i think the size of the pieces ... everything we 've heard ... gives good cause to believe that we 've now ( refocused ) the area , " former @entity97 official @entity96 told @entity0			2
" and that 's a huge relief to everybody ... i think it 's a high chance that they 're going to confirm that these ( are ) pieces of the wreckage			2
" but not every expert was convinced this is it			0
@entity112 , a senior editor with @entity113 , said that the size of the pieces -- since they are fairly square and large -- " do n't conform to anything that 's on the plane			2
" @entity118 , a former @entity42 aviation safety director , said he 'd be " surprised " if the objects came from the plane , rationalizing that anything that big would n't float			2
regardless , time is of the essence -- both for investigators and the loved ones of the plane 's 239 passengers and crew , who have waited since saturday for any breakthrough that would provide closure			1
the flight data recorders should " ping , " or send out a signal pointing to its location , for about 30 days from the time the aircraft set off , noted @entity96			2
after that , @entity10 could prove exponentially harder to find			0
" it 's the only clue that we 've had so far , " @entity0 aviation expert @entity137 said of the satellite imagery clues			1
" if this does n't prove to be the wreckage of 370 , then we 're back to square one			2
" timeline of @entity10 @entity37 minister : ' insufficient ' information the @entity148 flight set off seemingly without incident early saturday , not long after midnight , en route to @entity151			1
then , around 1:30 a.m. , all communication cut off over a location south and east of where the @entity2 satellite images were shot			1
@entity155 , the head of @entity35 's civil aviation department , said around 6 a.m. thursday in @entity34 -- hours after @entity2 's announcement -- that his agency had not seen the images			1
this assertion comes amid frustration about the investigation , search and communication surrounding both			0
relatives of those aboard the plane have expressed outrage , with video showing some of them angrily throwing water bottles at airline officials			0
and on tuesday , a middle - aged man -- who said his son was on that plane -- shouted , " @entity178 is passing by , " before bursting into tears			0
some involved in the multinational search operation have also vented about the ordeal			0
most of those on the flight were @entity2 , and the @entity2 government has urged @entity35 to speed up the pace of its investigation			1
and @entity187 , @entity37 's vice minister of transportation , has characterized the information that @entity35 officials have provided as " insufficient			1
" " up until now we only had one meeting with a @entity35 military attache , " he said			0
for now , @entity37 teams will stop searching the sea south of @entity196 province , the southern tip of @entity37 , and shift the focus to areas east of @entity196 , said @entity200 , the director of international affairs at the @entity37 @entity202			0
@entity35 's transportation and defense minister @entity203 defended his government 's approach			2
" we have been very consistent in the search , " he said			0
how you can help find the plane confusion about plane 's route over the weekend , authorities suddenly expanded their search to the other side of the @entity216 , in the @entity217 , where search efforts now seem to be concentrated			2
that location is hundreds of miles off the plane 's expected flight path			1
an explanation appeared to come tuesday when a senior @entity35 @entity224 official told @entity0 that the @entity224 had tracked the plane to a spot near the small island of @entity228 off @entity35 's west coast in the @entity217			2
the plane 's identifying transponder had stopped sending signals , too , said the official , who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media			2
@entity35 's civilian administration appeared to dispute the report , however			2
the @entity237 quoted a spokesman for the @entity35 prime minister 's office as saying tuesday that military officials had told him there was no evidence the plane had flown back over the @entity216			0
@entity10 : what we know and do n't know the prime minister 's office did n't immediately return calls from @entity0 seeking comment			0
in another shift , @entity35 authorities said at a news conference wednesday that radar records reviewed in the wake of the plane 's disappearance reveal an unidentified aircraft traveling across the @entity216 and some 200 miles into the @entity217			0
however , it was n't clear whether that radar signal represented @entity10 , gen. @entity259 , head of the @entity35 @entity224 , said at the news conference			0
@entity259 said then that officials are still " examining and analyzing all possibilities " when it comes to the plane 's flight path			1
as @entity266 , a commercial pilot and publisher of @entity268 , told @entity0 's @entity269 : " there 's so much confusing information flying around about this right now			1
" nothing has been ruled out as to what caused the plane 's communication systems -- including its crucial transponder -- to suddenly stop working			0
terrorism , hijacking , pilot error and a mechanical malfunction all remain just as valid as possibilities now as when the plane went missing			1
amid all the confusion and complaints , @entity35 prime minister @entity285 on wednesday appealed for patience			0
" the families involved have to understand that this is something unexpected , " @entity285 said			0
" the families must understand more efforts have been made with all our capabilities			0
" @entity293 is trying to keep it together for her two young sons , though the possibility of life without husband @entity298 is sometimes overwhelming			0
she 's clinging to hope even though , as @entity299 told @entity0 's @entity300 , it 's " not looking good			0
" " every day it just seems like it 's an eternity , it 's an absolute eternity , " @entity299 said from @entity301			1
" we can only go minute - by - minute ... and hope something comes soon			0
" what is a transponder ? @entity0 's @entity307 wrote from @entity308 ; @entity309 and @entity310 wrote from @entity311			0
@entity0 's @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 and journalist @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
