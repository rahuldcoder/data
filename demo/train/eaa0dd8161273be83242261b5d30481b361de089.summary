@entity0 -- the campaign to feed the world 's poor will get some much needed star power friday when @entity5 , co-founder of the global advocacy organization one , arrives to rally leaders of the @entity9 industrialized nations to take action			1
while the crisis in the eurozone will no doubt top the agenda when the @entity9 leaders gather friday for a two - day summit , the talks will also tackle the issue of food security and ways to feed a growing world population			1
at their annual summit in @entity23 , @entity24 , in 2009 , leaders pledged to provide $ 20 billion to fight hunger in the developing world over three years			2
since then , @entity28 president @entity27 and secretary of state @entity29 have embraced food security as a signature foreign policy issue , working to support farmers in @entity33 and other developing countries to improve agriculture			1
now , those 2009 commitments are set to expire			2
in an age of shrinking aid budgets with fewer resources available , donor governments ca n't solve the problem of world hunger alone			1
@entity43 , administrator of the @entity44 , said in an interview that major gains have been made in reducing hunger in most of the world , with the exception of @entity33			1
while he said the private sector has been interested in developing the @entity53 market , companies have been reluctant because of corruption and a lack of infrastructure			2
" they had the sense leaders are not committed , " @entity43 said of the private sector			0
since @entity23 , 30 @entity53 governments have developed internationally endorsed plans for investment in food security and agricultural development			1
their commitment to policy reforms to create a better climate for investors , @entity43 said , has created an interest in investing , with a focus on small farms			1
" these policy reform commitments are unlocking the potential of agriculture to explode and ending the perception of @entity33 , " @entity43 said			0
" @entity53 leaders are replacing the vision of hunger with growth and opportunity			2
" before a @entity9 session at the summit on food security with the leaders of @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , @entity5 will join @entity27 , @entity90 and other leaders in government , business , nonprofits and academia to discuss goals for eradicating world hunger @entity27 will address the symposium in @entity0 of the @entity99 , where administration officials say he will unveil a new @entity9 food security " alliance " to advance global agricultural development in @entity33 that includes the private sector and other key players			1
" we have recognized that it is eight to 10 times more expensive to feed people when they are in crisis than it does to help farmers feed themselves and build better resources , " @entity43 said			0
" if we can be innovative in the private sector , we can have much better outcomes			0
" over the last several months , @entity43 said , the effort has secured more than $ 3 billion in concrete private investment commitments , almost half of which came from @entity53 companies			1
on friday , @entity43 said , 35 companies are expected to make additional commitments for projects ranging from manufacturing fertilizer plants and building storage facilities to providing mobile phones to help farmers use mobile banking and other services to cut out middlemen and become part of a cash economy			0
" historically , the private sector has not been as active in the agriculture space as it should be , but that is starting to change " said @entity131 , global policy director of the @entity133			0
" there is enormous potential when you have donor countries and the private sector working with @entity53 government in support of these country plans			2
that is where magic can happen			0
" advocacy groups hope the @entity9 will shift its focus from money to meeting concrete goals on hunger and nutrition , including lifting 50 million people out of poverty and preventing stunted development of 15 million children over the next 10 years			1
while praising the efforts of the private sector and recognizing the potential multiplier effect , some advocacy groups voice concern that without the involvement of nongovernmental organizations , the resources will not reach the poorest who are most in need			0
@entity167 , the head of @entity168 , an alliance of @entity28 - based relief and development groups , says the focus should be on small plots of land for farmers to feed their families and have disposable income to participate in the local economy			2
" @entity33 is becoming a big new market			0
how that market is developed will make a big difference in the lives of its poorest farmers , " he said			0
" you will need multinational companies to drive the development of the market , but you will need just as much the voice of local groups providing checks and balances to help ensure the market is supporting the needs of local shareholders			0
