-- a video camera mounted inside the police car of a @entity6 police officer slain thursday showed a man with a weapon who appears to be same person as a man who was later found shot dead about a quarter of a mile away , a @entity2 state police official said thursday night			1
maj. @entity11 added that , at this point in this investigation , " we can not say definitively " that the second victim had fired the shots that killed officer @entity17			2
but the man does appear on video footage from moments before that officer was killed , and he also matches the description first put out by police of the suspect			1
in addition , @entity11 said authorities " have recovered clothing items that lead us to believe that " the second victim and the man on the video " are one and the same			2
" the incident began about 12:15 p.m. , when @entity17 , a four - year @entity6 police veteran , pulled over someone during a routine traffic stop in the @entity36 parking lot near @entity37			1
the @entity36 at @entity6 houses athletic facilities			2
soon thereafter , police " dispatch was unable to make contact with the officer , " @entity6 deputy police chief @entity41 said			1
then , before 12:30 p.m. , police received their first call from a witness who said he 'd seen the suspect -- who state police sgt. @entity51 said authorities " do not believe ... was in the vehicle that was stopped " -- approach the officer 's car and open fire			1
a few minutes later , at 12:36 p.m. , the first of six alerts was issued to the campus community about the shooting			2
a visibly upset @entity60 described to @entity0 affiliate @entity61 how she 'd been walking nearby and saw police pull up around the vehicle of the officer who had been shot			1
" when they opened ( the car door ) , he just fell out toward the ground , and they immediately started reviving him , " she said , adding that two officers then took off with weapons after the gunman			2
@entity72 , an employee in the school 's athletic department , told @entity0 he also saw first - responders trying to resuscitate someone in the same area , which is also near the university 's football stadium			2
the shooter had fled on foot toward a parking lot known as " the @entity85 , " school spokesman @entity81 said			0
this suspect was " described as white male , gray sweat pants , gray hat w / neon green brim , maroon hoodie and backpack , " @entity6 said in posts on its website and @entity89 feed			2
about a quarter - mile from the first shooting , in what 's described as the " @entity101 , " a law enforcement officer saw a suspicious man and tried to contact him , @entity96 deputy chief @entity41 said			1
" by the time they turned around and located the subject , that subject was deceased , " the deputy chief said			0
gov. @entity106 said thursday night that " another gunshot " had been heard between 15 to 30 minutes after the first shooting			1
the clothes tied to the initial suspect description were recovered later			2
@entity11 , though , did not state they were found on the second dead man , where he was found			1
while several updates were sent out , it was n't until 4:30 p.m. that the school announced on its @entity89 feed that " law enforcement agencies have determined there is no longer an active threat or need to secure in place			0
" on thursday afternoon , authorities similarly did not explicitly state that the second person shot dead had earlier killed the police officer			1
@entity51 said only that " investigators feel confident that they have located " the officer 's shooter			1
" when the university lifted the alert , they consulted with several people and they felt that it was safe for students and faculty to go about their day , " @entity51 said			0
" we like to think that things are safe			0
" @entity17 , 39 , joined the @entity6 police force six months after the 2007 mass shooting , according to a release on the school 's website			1
a @entity144 veteran who had worked at the @entity146 jail and with the @entity147 , the @entity142 resident is survived by his wife as well as five children and stepchildren			0
the second slain man has not been identified by name			2
and police also have not given a possible motive for the shootings			2
the @entity156 are taking the lead in the investigation , @entity41 said			0
federal agents are involved as well , including six agents from the @entity160 who responded to the scene , @entity160 spokesman @entity159 said			0
in addition to reviewing the video from @entity17 's car , investigators are sorting through ballistic and dna evidence and interviewing witnesses , said @entity11 of the state police the episode rattled a campus where 33 people were killed on april 16 , 2007 , when student @entity176 went on a shooting rampage			1
two of those deaths occurred at @entity180 , across the street from the @entity36 lot			0
" in light of the turmoil and the trauma and the tragedy suffered by this campus by guns , i can only say that words do n't describe our feelings and they are most elusive at this point in time , " @entity6 president @entity183 told reporters thursday			1
on thursday , law enforcement and school officials said the alert system put in place in recent years worked well , both from technological and communications standpoints			0
" what i observed and experienced was significant cooperation from everybody i encountered , " @entity41 said of what he saw , on campus , after the alerts went out			0
" i think the community received the notification and responded to that , as we asked them to			0
" @entity211 , a risk management consultant who has worked with other universities on campus management , said it appears that accurate information was communicated quickly and methodically -- in contrast to what happened four years ago			0
that said , she said school administrators should now review whether that information got out to everyone who needed to get it			0
" did the messages work across the board ? " @entity211 asked rhetorically			0
one school administrator said he and other staffers locked rooms and laboratories in @entity231 within three minutes of getting the first alert around 12:36 p.m. in the subsequent hours , he said faculty and employees got " regular and updated information " that he described as " very helpful " and calming			0
" we 've practiced this over time , " said @entity237 , head of @entity6 's department of communication , told @entity0 affiliate wsls during the lockdown			1
" this is kind of scary to go through ... it brings back so much			0
" @entity106 lauded the communications effort not just as governor , but also as a parent : his daughter is a @entity6 master 's student who was confined to a basement classroom during the four - hour episode			1
" like so many parents who had children on the @entity6 campus , i felt a lot of that angst and uncertainty , " he said			2
" again , i want to express my gratitude to law enforcement for making sure that they kept the faculty ( and ) parents regularly informed			0
" classes for the semester ended wednesday			0
students were preparing thursday for final exams for the fall semester , though the university announced on its website that friday 's exams had been postponed to saturday			1
a small vigil was held thursday night on the @entity274 campus , and a similar event is scheduled for for 6:30 p.m. friday , according to a posting on the student government association 's @entity89 account			1
beyond @entity6 , thursday 's incident had ripple effects elsewhere in western @entity2			1
all public schools in @entity283 -- where @entity274 is located -- were also placed on lockdown , county school superintendent @entity281 said			0
@entity285 eventually began at 3:30 p.m. , after a delay of more than an hour			0
in addition , a western @entity2 rest area along @entity290 was shut down thursday afternoon , @entity288 spokesman @entity287 said			0
the stop , on the highway 's northbound side , is about nine miles from the @entity6 exit			1
he did not know whether that move -- which was ordered by state police -- was related to the @entity274 shooting			1
@entity51 noted there was " some suspicious activity at that location , " though he also declined to say whether it was related to the @entity6 incident			2
several @entity6 administrators -- including the head of campus police , @entity308 , and the emergency management director , @entity310 -- were in @entity311 on thursday at a federal court hearing on the 2007 shooting on the school 's campus , according to @entity316 @entity318 officials			1
@entity308 and the school were criticized after that incident for not notifying students quickly enough that there was a danger on campus			0
the hearing was an appeal of the @entity318 's fine of $ 55,000 on @entity6 under the @entity328 , a federal law related to campus safety			1
in april , @entity2 attorney general @entity331 called the 2007 case against @entity6 " monday - morning quarterbacking at its very worst			2
" as to thursday 's incident , @entity51 stressed that there were " two crime scenes " -- where the two bodies were found -- and that the probe is ongoing , with many questions still unanswered			1
at the same time , he voiced confidence that " things are safe for people to be out again			0
" " these are large crime scenes and it takes several hours to put the puzzle together , " the state police sergeant said			1
" we still do n't have a lot of the puzzle pieces connected			0
" @entity0 's @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 and @entity355 contributed to this report .			0
