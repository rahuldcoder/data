-- @entity1 , the workhorse lawyer who won acquittals for @entity3 at the most - watched murder trial in years , may be either the best criminal defense attorney in @entity5 -- or the luckiest			1
it took him eight years to convince the @entity9 @entity8 to let him practice law , and he 'd been trying cases for just three years when the @entity13 case came along			1
many observers of the seven - week murder trial said he was in over his head and predicted doom			1
the judge scolded him so often he became the bad boy of @entity20			0
bloggers and trial watchers took to calling him " @entity23			2
" in the end , none of the digs mattered because @entity1 got results			1
convicted and pilloried in the court of public opinion , @entity13 was cleared of all murder - related charges in a court of law			1
whether by luck or by skill , @entity1 suddenly is looking less like a clown and more like the @entity37 version of late legal legend @entity38			1
they 're calling him " @entity40			0
" in a lengthy interview with " in session " in april , the 42 - year - old @entity1 recalled being in law school and ducking out of class to watch @entity46 's televised murder trial			1
@entity38 became one of his heroes			1
" i could win this case and i could win several more , and i still could n't accomplish what @entity38 did in his time practicing law , " @entity1 said			1
" i do n't like the comparison , because i do n't deserve it			2
" @entity1 entered the @entity13 case as an unknown , but his status skyrocketed overnight after her acquittal			1
now , he has an agent to field calls from @entity61 and invitations to sail on @entity64 's yacht			2
the new darling of the cable chat circuit is remarkably ordinary , the type of low - budget , constantly hustling defense attorney found in courthouses everywhere -- working the calendar calls , the jails , the bail bondsmen in a constant search for clients			0
that 's how he came to meet @entity3			1
" apparently there were a couple of people in the jail that gave her my name , referred me to her , " he said			0
" i 've built up a hard reputation of fighting for my clients			0
100 % of my business comes from referrals			0
i do n't advertise , i do n't have television ads or billboards or anything like that and i never have			2
" @entity13 recalled her decision during a recorded jailhouse visit with her parents			1
the recording was played at the trial : " it kind of happened at random in booking , " she said			2
" i heard a couple of people talking about attorneys			0
his name came up and i said , ' if he 's good , can you do me a favor and pass my name along ? ' " @entity1 had to listen in court as the parents expressed their doubts about him in another recorded visit			1
" i just hope that the compassion that he says he has is genuine , " said @entity13 , an ex-cop			1
" i hope he 's not building a reputation for himself			2
" here 's how @entity1 bills himself on his law firm 's web site : " aggressive , experienced , @entity119			1
" but the site does n't let visitors read his biography or the cases it highlights : " high profile murder trial ; " " taking on the mayor ; " " @entity126 accused of kidnapping ; " and " state trooper cleared			1
" click on any of them , and you are returned to the top of the home page			0
" i relate to people , " he said in the " @entity135 " interview , conducted before the trial began			2
we all have erasers on our pencils			0
we 've all done some stupid things in life that should not define us			0
" like his clients , @entity1 has acquired a few scuffs and dings			1
he was born in @entity147 in 1969 and raised by a single mother in @entity149 and the @entity150			0
he dropped out of @entity149 's @entity151 his freshman year and married at 17 when he learned he would be a father			2
" when i found out i was going to be a father , i decided i had to man up and accept responsibility and take care of my child			0
so at 17 , i joined the @entity157 , " he said			0
" it 's amazing what a child does to you			2
" he earned his ged and later attended @entity162 and @entity163			0
law school was almost an afterthought			0
asked why he decided to go law school at @entity167 , he responded , " a girl			0
" he had to wait eight years for admission to @entity170 , according to public records			1
a @entity9 @entity8 ruling in 2000 highlights the @entity170 's concerns about " @entity176 's " character and finances , citing his failure to pay child support and other debts and expenditures such as signing up for a gym membership he could n't afford			1
( all bar matters refer to the candidates by their initials , and @entity1 's struggle with the @entity170 has been widely reported			1
he declined to discuss the incident in detail with " @entity135			0
" ) while he waited for admission to the bar , he worked as an intern for the @entity192 , taught lawyers to conduct research and launched four companies , including two that sold bathing suits ; @entity199 bikinis and @entity200			2
" there 's no better place for a young lawyer to learn how to be a lawyer than the @entity192 , " he said			2
" i was surrounded by great lawyers ... there is a culture there of really learning how to fight for your client and if you 're not a fighter , then you do n't belong there			2
" he finally was admitted to the bar in 2005 , and began to practice in @entity214 and nearby @entity215 , where he lives in a gated community overlooking a golf course and a lake			0
before the @entity13 case , @entity1 said , he tried more than 45 cases , including four alleging murder			1
none of his clients had been convicted of first - degree murder , he boasted			2
he is most confident about his ability to outwork the opposition			0
" if i can do that , then i stand a chance and that is my goal , " he said during the " @entity135 " interview			0
though he has been criticized for the celebratory nature of the defense team 's gathering after the verdict -- cameras caught members dancing and drinking champagne -- @entity1 has mostly avoided the white light of fame			1
when he first took on the @entity13 case and camera crews began staking out his office , he made them park across the street			1
he said he does n't watch news reports about his cases anymore			1
" you 're one day practicing law and you 're occasionally on the 11 o'clock news			0
the next day you 're in the middle of this blood sport , " he said			0
" and you become a story			0
" a lot of times , he added , that story is exaggerated or simply not true			0
" i had a stomachache once , " he recalled			0
" i went to the hospital , and it was on the national news the next day that i was freaking out or something along those lines			0
i think ( the reports said ) i was caving under pressure and i might be quitting and things like that , and it really was just bad @entity266 food			0
" it is not clear how much he has been paid to represent @entity13 , although he could be in line for a percentage of any book or movie deals stemming from the case			1
suffice it to say that given the time he has put into the case , his hourly rate dips well below the minimum wage			0
but he ca n't put a price on the satisfaction he felt after @entity3 was acquitted of murdering her daughter			1
" when i get home tonight and my daughter asked what i did today , i can say i saved a life , " @entity1 told reporters after the verdict			2
" my driving force the last three years has been to make sure there has been justice for @entity3 and @entity288 , because @entity288 did not murder @entity3			1

@entity1 was n't taken seriously until he won acquittals at @entity3 's murder trial
it took @entity1 eight years to gain admission into @entity170 because of debts
he had been trying cases for just three years when he took the @entity13 case
the late @entity38 , who won the @entity46 murder trial , is one of his heroes
