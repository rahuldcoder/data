@entity0 -- it 's one of the busiest days in this year 's primary calendar			1
six states from coast to coast hold primaries on tuesday , and again anti-establishment candidates face long odds in high - profile @entity10 showdowns			2
since its birth in 2009 , the tea party has had a number of primary successes , with victorious challenges from the right producing major headlines for the movement			1
but they 've also given the party plenty of headaches and hurt its chances of winning back the @entity24 , effectively costing the @entity10 five winnable elections over the last two cycles			1
this year , the establishment learned to fight back , and so far has had the upper hand in most contests against tea party - backed challengers			1
here are five key showdowns to watch how they play out on tuesday			0
big showdown in the @entity34 : tuesday 's marquee battle is in @entity34 , where @entity24 gop leader @entity36 is challenged by businessman @entity37 , who enjoys strong support from many tea party groups and influential conservative anti-establishment organizations			1
while this race has seen big spending by the campaigns and outside groups , @entity41 is expected to cruise to renomination for a sixth term			1
anti-establishment republicans feel @entity41 represents everything wrong in @entity0 and thought he could be knocked off			0
the @entity52 fund , a @entity0 - based anti-establishment organization , spent around $ 1 million in support of @entity37 and against @entity41			0
but it 's been quiet recently , with @entity41 's formidable lead in the polls			2
@entity41 had two @entity34 - based super pacs supporting him as well as the @entity61 @entity60 and the @entity62			0
" it was a vintage @entity36 campaign			1
they found @entity37 's weaknesses and used them against him			2
they boxed him in and he could n't move , " said @entity66 , senior editor for the non-partisan @entity67 , a top campaign handicapper			0
she added that " @entity37 suffered from new candidate syndrome			0
" @entity41 's ending his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from @entity34 's other @entity10 senator , @entity73			1
@entity73 was the upstart who beat @entity41 's pick in the race			1
but @entity73 , who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians , backed @entity41 last year before @entity37 got into the race			1
the narrator in one of @entity41 's two closing statewide tv commercials says , " on tuesday , join with @entity73 and vote for @entity36			1
" and the spot includes a clip of @entity73 saying last year that @entity34 " ought to be proud of having senator @entity41			0
" while @entity41 should have an early night on tuesday , he faces a serious challenge in november from rising @entity88 star @entity87			1
big - name democrats are already campaigning for her			0
@entity90 -- the other big event : the other high - profile , outsider vs. establishment battle of the night is in the @entity95			1
eight - term rep. @entity96 faces a serious primary challenge from @entity98 , an attorney who claims that @entity99 's not conservative enough and is soft on spending			1
@entity98 is backed by some tea party groups and by the @entity0 - based anti-tax group @entity102 , which has a history of backing conservative primary challengers			1
the group has spent some $ 700,000 to attack @entity99 and support @entity98			0
but their spending dwindled the past couple of weeks , as @entity99 has held a sizable lead in recent polls			0
@entity99 is backed by the @entity61 @entity60 , which has spent heavily in the race			2
" you can take it from me , the conservative choice for @entity115 is @entity96 , " @entity111 says in one ad put out by the chamber last month			0
@entity99 , was an early backer of the @entity10 2012 presidential nominee 's campaign			2
and @entity111 returned the favor last year , endorsing @entity99			0
the winner of the primary will be the odds - on - favorite in november in the heavily @entity10 district , which covers the central and eastern parts of the state , from @entity129 to the borders with @entity131 and @entity132			2
@entity133 -- tea party splits vote : @entity10 sen. @entity137 ' announcement last year that he would n't run for re-election triggered a free - for - all @entity10 primary battle			1
@entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , former @entity133 secretary of state @entity144 , and businessman @entity145 are the major candidates and @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity145 , rather than the more conservative @entity142 and @entity141 , are on top of public opinion polls			0
" i think they ( @entity142 and @entity141 ) both ran terrible campaigns , " said the @entity151 's @entity66			0
" because both of them were in there , the tea party movement was divided			1
" the primary campaign 's closing days have seen near daily attacks between the candidates			1
an example of how ugly it 's getting on the campaign trail : @entity141 's campaign sent out an email accusing @entity148 of " promoting teenage homosexuality , " highlighting a vote she took in favor of funding for an @entity173 youth program when she served on the @entity174			1
since no candidate 's expected to top 50 % , this contest 's all - but - certain to head to a july 22 runoff between the top two finishers			2
the eventual @entity10 nominee will face off against @entity180 , the all - but - certain @entity88 nominee and daughter of former longtime sen. @entity182 , a household name in @entity133			2
@entity184 -- a last - minute wildcard ? : the race for the @entity10 @entity24 nomination in @entity184 , a vote - by - mail state , has only recently grabbed some national attention , mostly due to some high - profile support for @entity192 pediatric neurosurgeon dr. @entity191			1
she recently won endorsements from @entity111 and another 2012 @entity10 presidential candidate : former house speaker @entity195 , who 's a co-host of @entity1 's " @entity196			0
" more importantly , @entity0 - based @entity197 went up with major television , digital and radio spots in support of @entity191			0
the organization was formed early last year , following the 2012 @entity10 election defeats , by a group of @entity10 veterans to refocus its messaging and policy goals in an attempt to broaden the @entity10 's appeal beyond its traditional base			0
@entity191 , who also enjoys the backing of several @entity10 senators including @entity41 , grabbed some attention last month for a campaign ad of her own			0
the 60 - second spot highlighted a woman who was advised to consider terminating her pregnancy because her unborn daughter had spinal problems			0
in the ad , the woman recalls how @entity191 operated on her daughter shortly after she was born , and that the girl is now a healthy 12 - year - old			0
but @entity191 's support for abortion rights has fueled a six - figure spending push by anti-abortion groups in opposing @entity191			0
polls show @entity191 ahead of more conservative state rep. @entity231 , who was backed last week by former sen. @entity233 of @entity234 , a @entity10 presidential candidate last time who may run again for the @entity95 in 2016			2
the wildcard : a last - minute story over the weekend revealed that after a breakup last year with the wealthy man she was dating , @entity191 was accused of " stalking " him , according to a police report			0
the primary winner will run in november against first - term @entity88 sen. @entity244 , who @entity10 think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the @entity10			1
@entity234 -- a race to the left : republicans ca n't have all the fun			1
the @entity88 gubernatorial primary contest in the @entity234 has been one long wild ride			1
in this race to the left , rep. @entity252 has been touting her strong support for the health care law , better known as @entity257 , a rare sight this midterm election year , as she plays catchup with businessman @entity260 , who leads in the polls			2
@entity260 was virtually unknown in @entity234 at the start of the year , but he spent big bucks to flood the airwaves with ads. @entity260 has increasingly come under attack from @entity252 as well as state treasurer @entity267 , another contender in the field			2
the winner will face off in november against @entity10 gov. @entity270 , who seems to be enjoying the food fight among the @entity88 challengers			2
" the @entity277 fight for governor is getting ugly , " says the narrator in a new @entity270 tv ad that uses a boxing theme			0
but @entity270 has his own concerns , as he 's considered one of the most vulnerable governors running for re-election this year .			0

senate minority leader @entity36 faces tea party challenge
*incumbent* @entity90 *congressman* is expected to fend off @entity285 challenge , too
