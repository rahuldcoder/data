@entity0 -- @entity2 , the @entity4 @entity3 cleric who has been staunchly opposed to the @entity6 troop presence in his country since the occupation began last decade , warned against the prospects of a " challenge " with any @entity6 forces that stay in @entity4			1
" go forth from our holy land and go back to your families who are waiting for you impatiently , that you and we , as well , lead a peaceful life together , " said @entity2 on tuesday			2
his @entity18 militia was a major factor in the sectarian violence that erupted during the height of the war			0
@entity24 issued his statement as @entity4 decides whether to request that some of the 47,000 or so troops in @entity4 stay beyond a january 1 , 2012 , deadline agreed upon between the two countries			1
but @entity4 leaders have agreed that the government will begin talking with @entity6 officials about leaving @entity6 forces inside @entity4 on a training mission			1
" all political leaders have agreed on the @entity6 training mission in @entity4 except the @entity38 , who have some reservations , " president @entity34 told reporters			1
that 's unacceptable to @entity2 , who issued his remarks " on the basis of the logic of common humanity , in the name of a country in which you have made an incursion for years			1
" " enough of this occupation , terror and abuse			0
we are not in need of your help			0
we are able to combat and defeat terrorism , and achieve unity			0
we are not in need of your bases , your experience and etc. " @entity2 said			0
" go forth , " he said , " that we may not enter into a challenge with you or your trainers			1
" since 2003 , @entity2 has had the support of tens of thousands of @entity3 , especially the young and impoverished in @entity0 's slums and the @entity3 south			2
his @entity18 has been considered one of @entity4 's most formidable private armies after the fall of @entity71			2
@entity24 suspended most of its activities in 2007 and 2008 , which dramatically reduced violence in @entity4			1
in 2008 , @entity2 announced that most of the militia members would be transitioned into a socio - cultural organization to oppose secularism and @entity80 thought			0
but @entity24 has ratcheted his anti-american rhetoric up in recent months , raising concerns about an increase in violence as @entity4 weighs an extension to the @entity6 presence			1
an increase in attacks in recent months against @entity6 troops has been blamed on @entity3 militias , including the @entity90			1
the @entity6 military says the militia is using the bombings to try to take credit for driving forces out of the country			0
the @entity6 military maintains that the @entity90 and other @entity3 militias are backed by @entity98 , a charge @entity100 has long denied			0
the cleric , who recently returned to @entity4 from three years of self - imposed exile , has transformed himself from the leader of the @entity18 to a political player			0
his political bloc has now joined forces with a former rival , prime minister @entity108			0
the @entity109 emerged as one of the kingmakers in @entity4 politics last year when it won 39 parliamentary seats .			2
