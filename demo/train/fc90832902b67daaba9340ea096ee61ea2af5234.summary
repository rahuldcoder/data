-- in the final weekend before @entity3 3 kicks off the summer movie season in earnest , @entity2 's r - rated action comedy @entity1 topped a slow weekend at the box office with $ 20 million from 3,277 theaters , giving it an average of $ 6,103 per location			1
the @entity12 film achieved only a fraction of the opening weekend grosses of @entity16 's transformers films , but it only cost a fraction — just $ 26 million — of those films as well			1
it 's well on its way to profitability			1
@entity1 , which stars @entity23 and @entity22 , redeemed both stars following unimpressive box office results for action films earlier this year			1
@entity23 's @entity27 petered out with just $ 19.7 million , while @entity22 's @entity28 fared only slightly better , grossing $ 42.1 million			2
while both those films had darker , more serious tones , @entity1 was marketed as a sunny , over-the - top black comedy			1
unfortunately , audience reaction was n't particularly sunny			2
@entity34 moviegoers issued @entity1 a dreadful " @entity35			1
in second place , @entity37 's sci - fi adventure @entity36 , which last week debuted with $ 37.1 million , dropped 53 percent to $ 17.4 million , giving it a 10 - day total of $ 64.7 million			1
while the @entity41 film seems unlikely to reach @entity37 's one - time benchmark of $ 100 million domestically , its $ 134.1 million international total lifts prospects considerably			1
still , a $ 198.8 million worldwide total versus a $ 120 million budget is n't an incredible result after accounting for distribution and marketing costs			2
@entity51 ' $ 40 million @entity50 drama 42 scored another $ 10.7 million in its third weekend , representing a 40 percent decline			2
with a cumulative gross of $ 69.1 million so far , 42 is a big winner for @entity51 , which badly needed a hit following flops like @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59			0
yet most analysts expected the film , which earned an " a + " cinemascore grade , to reach $ 100 million			0
that no longer seems plausible			0
' @entity22 ' musical headed to @entity65 in ' 14 @entity68 - studded romantic comedy @entity66 flopped in its opening weekend , with just $ 7.5 million from 2,633 theaters , giving it a sad $ 2,848 per theater average			1
the $ 35 million @entity73 release got off to a weaker start than other recent wedding titles like @entity76 , and @entity77 — and all of those were considered misfires upon release			0
the @entity82 , which features performances by @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity91 , garnered wretched reviews from most critics , and audiences , which were 77 percent female and 66 percent above the age of 30 , gave it an ugly " @entity97			0
@entity99 dinner : @entity100 , @entity101 in spoofs the @entity103 spent its sixth weekend in the top 5 with $ 6.6 million ( a 29 percent drop ) , lifting the colorful @entity107 comedy to $ 163 million total			2
the @entity110 - distributed film , produced by @entity111 for $ 135 million , has carried even more cash into its cave internationally , and this weekend it passed the $ 300 million mark			2
worldwide , @entity103 has earned a terrific $ 471 million , and it will zoom right past the half - billion mark some time in the next two weeks			0
unsurprisingly , a sequel is already in the works			0
@entity1 -- $ 20 million 2			1
@entity36 -- $ 17.4 million 3			1
42 -- $ 10.7 million 4			0
the @entity82 -- $ 7.5 million 5			0
the @entity103 -- $ 6.6 million despite the success of films like @entity103 , @entity120 , and @entity121 , the first third of 2013 has n't been a particularly good one at the box office			1
for the year to date , both attendance and revenue at the @entity127 box office are down 12 percent , and @entity128 is now turning its attention to potential blockbusters like @entity3 3 , @entity131 , and @entity132 to turn this year 's prospects around			1
@entity3 3 , at least , seems like a safe bet			0
the superhero sequel debuted this weekend in 42 overseas territories ( about 79 percent of the international market ) , where it earned an incredible $ 195.3 million — a higher figure than @entity140 ' $ 185.1 million start			2
that figure is even more impressive when your realize that @entity3 3 has yet to open in powerhouse territories like @entity144 , @entity145 , and @entity146			0
@entity3 3 achieved the best opening weekend ever in a number of @entity149 countries ( @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , and @entity156 ) , which is a testament to the continent 's booming box offices , but perhaps also to @entity160 's efforts to tailor the picture to better appeal to @entity149 filmgoers			1
the film opens in the @entity127 on friday and is expected to open above $ 150 million			0
