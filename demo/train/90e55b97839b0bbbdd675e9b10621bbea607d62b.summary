" a lot of these individuals have dedicated many years of their lives to going out and assisting and tracking storms , and getting footage and putting themselves in harm 's way so they can educate the public to the destructive power of these storms			2
" friday 's tornado took a sudden turn that surprised many observers , @entity15 meteorologist @entity66 said			1
" it was a wobbler			2
... i think the left - hand turn made a big difference on how this thing was chased as well and why people were killed and why people were injured in their vehicles , " he said			1
" a vehicle is not a place to be in any tornado , especially a big one like that , and those men doing their job , those field scientists out there doing their jobs , were killed in the process			1

" one of @entity11 ' goals , @entity66 said , was collecting more data to help government officials			0
" we all know that this is difficult and dangerous and sometimes things go wrong			0
but i think to portray @entity119 as just a chaser out for a thrill is just the wrong thing , " @entity66 said			1
" i just want people to know that @entity119 was a scientist			1
he was out there to put probes out there			0
he was out there to learn and understand and to make science more understandable			0

" though we sometimes take it for granted , @entity119 's death is a stark reminder of the risks encountered regularly by the men and women who work for us , " @entity145 said			1
" this is an enormous loss for his family , his wide circle of friends and colleagues and @entity143			0
" @entity168 , a videographer who chases storms and calls himself " the @entity170 , " said the three men were more than storm chasers			0
" they 're researchers , " he said			0
" this thing is really shaking up everyone in the chasing community , " he said			1
" we knew this day would happen someday , but nobody would imagine that it would happen to @entity119 was one of the safest people to go out there			1
... he 's had close calls , but he 's always had an escape route			0
" @entity13 mayor @entity186 did n't provide details about those killed after the tornado struck , but he stressed the importance of staying indoors when powerful storms hit			1
" we had to deal with not only strong winds , but we had extreme hail , extreme softball - size hail			0
@entity13 had a lot of damage to the roads , " he told reporters on sunday			0
" in these situations , we ca n't stress enough to people to stay inside and do what the weather men and women tell us to do			1
" close call : one storm chaser 's story friday 's storm was particularly unpredictable , according to @entity209 , an anchor and meteorologist for @entity211 who had a close call himself			1
the tornado swept up the tornado - hunt truck he and a crew were traveling in , tossed it 200 yards into a field and smashed it to the ground			1
" i think this was just an erratic tornado			2
i think the size of it and the speed of it changed very , very quickly , " he told @entity15 on sunday morning			0
" i think the direction of movement changed quickly			0
and i think there were a lot of people out there that , you know , ended up getting stuck in positions we did n't want to be in			2
" @entity209 described the experience as the scariest moment of his life			0
" i saw people in my life , i saw their faces flash right in front of me			2
and it just seemed for a moment , everything was in slow motion , especially when we were floating , " he said			0

i was conscious through the whole thing and remember the whole thing , but it 's still a surreal moment			0

one crew member had broken bones , he said , but was in good spirits			0
the experience left him rattled and unsure whether he 'll go out to chase storms again			0
but @entity209 said he had no doubt about the value of storm chasing			2
" we show weather , and we like to be out there and show people what these things can do , and help give advance warning			1
a lot of times the storm spotters out there serve a very valuable purpose			0
they give ground truth to what meteorologists from the @entity279 are doing , " he said			0
" but seeing it in person , seeing it for real , and giving that real time information , i think really supplements the warning			0
it helps people take shelter ahead of time			2

the network expressed condolences in a statement sunday			0
