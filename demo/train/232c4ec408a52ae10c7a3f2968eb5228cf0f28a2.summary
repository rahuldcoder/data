@entity0 -- the @entity3 is planning a " very aggressive sales job " that will involve the vice president , cabinet members and travel across the nation for president @entity8 's executive action on immigration , a top @entity3 aide said friday			1
speaking at a breakfast hosted by the @entity14 , @entity3 senior adviser @entity12 told reporters that after friday 's address on the topic in @entity18 , @entity8 will head to @entity19 next tuesday to speak with activists			1
the sales pitch , which @entity12 called a " very important priority , " will continue beyond december , with travel across the nation			1
" [ the president will ] first make the case to the country about what we did , why we did it , explain to the country why it 's consistent with past presidents of both parties , " @entity12 said , adding a key component will also be educating the nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants the move could help on how to apply to the program			1
@entity8 announced a widely controversial plan to delay deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally during a primetime address thursday night , and was immediately met with fierce @entity43 opposition			2
house speaker @entity44 ( @entity45 ) pledged during a friday morning press conference that the @entity3 will " rise to this challenge " and respond to the order , which he said " damaged " the presidency			1
some @entity51 have floated attaching a policy rider to the upcoming must - pass government spending bill that would defund implementation of the executive order , which president @entity8 would then veto , effectively leading to another shutdown			1
@entity12 invoked incoming senate majority leader @entity59 's ( @entity58			1
) warning against shutting down the government in arguing the @entity43 should n't choose that route of response			0
" certainly , our hope is that @entity51 will listen to senator @entity65 , who has said two things : one is that @entity51 have to demonstrate to the @entity68 people that they can govern , and two , there 'll be no shutdowns or threats or things [ like impeachment ] , " @entity12 said			0
@entity51 have warned for weeks that the move would " poison the well " with the @entity43 and kill any possibility for compromise with the @entity3			0
@entity12 said the president hopes @entity51 wo n't use the executive action as an excuse not to work with them on other issues			2
" it 's sort of the 3rd grade equivalent of taking your ball and going home , " he said			0
@entity12 defended the choice to move on key issues unilaterally , arguing that , for the president , even " getting out of bed in the morning comes with @entity43 opposition			2
" " [ if ] you can only do things that are not going to make some republicans very mad , then we would do nothing , " he said			0
and he hinted that more may be to come			0
@entity12 said the president gathered his aides the day after the party suffered deeply damaging losses during the midterm elections , losing control of the @entity103 and a handful of moderates in the @entity3 , to remind them that time is running out in his presidency and they 'll never have a better opportunity to " do good " in the world			1
" he does feel the pressure of time , we all do			0
we have a little bit over two years left here , " said , and the president wants to " maximize " his efforts to get things done in the remaining time			2
" we 're gon na be looking for opportunities to work with @entity51 , but we 've also made it clear that where we have authority to act , and where we can do what we can to move the ball forward , we 're going to do that , " @entity12 said .			0
