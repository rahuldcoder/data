@entity0 -- there was good news and bad news thursday at a congressional hearing on the embattled @entity7 health care system			1
politicians , health care experts and a @entity7 official agreed solutions exist , but more than three hours of questioning by the @entity13 showed that responses so far by @entity15 and the administration fall short of what 's needed			1
" it 's going to take wholesale , systematic reform of the entire department , " said @entity18 rep. @entity18 of @entity19 , the committee chairman			0
" it 's very clear the status quo is not acceptable and it 's time for real change			0
" dr. @entity28 , a top official in the @entity7 health administration , also acknowledged the need for major changes after revelations first reported by @entity1 of sometimes deadly waits for medical care faced by veterans			1
" we own this " " we know that we have let veterans down , but we 're going to make it right , " @entity28 told the panel , adding that " you all deserve better from us			1
" declaring that " we own this " and " we 're going to fix it , " he later said : " today we really need to be looking at the entire structure of the organization to move forward			0
we really need to examine everything			0
" an internal @entity7 audit released monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care , while even more who signed up in the @entity7 system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested			1
the @entity7 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care , and @entity1 's reporting uncovered the deaths of dozens of others who were waiting for va care in @entity61			1
despite efforts in recent years to address longstanding problems at the department , including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans , the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care			2
reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in @entity79 and @entity80 , and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment			2
the @entity7 audit confirmed @entity1 reports of secret wait lists used to cover up wait times that exceeded department guidelines			2
the controversy led to the resignation of @entity7 secretary @entity93 , while some @entity7 officials have been put on administrative leave pending investigations by the @entity7 inspector general 's office and @entity15			2
@entity99 getting involved on wednesday , the @entity99 said it opened a criminal investigation of the @entity7 in conjunction with the inspector general 's probe , which has expanded to 69 facilities			0
" at the department 's direction , the @entity99 has instructed agents in its @entity61 office to conduct an investigation into the allegations related to the @entity7 , " a @entity106 spokesman said			0
" federal prosecutors will be working with these investigators to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges			0
" meanwhile , both the @entity13 and @entity118 have passed legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at @entity125 facilities at the government 's expense			1
they now will negotiate a compromise between differences in the two measures			0
interim veterans affairs secretary @entity131 , who took over when @entity93 stepped down , also has announced a series of steps in response to the problems			0
they include a hiring freeze at central headquarters and 21 regional facilities , suspension of all performance awards for senior managers in fiscal year 2014 , eliminating an unattainable goal of getting newly enrolled veterans an appointment within 14 days , and ordering an independent outside audit of @entity7 medical care scheduling practices across the system			1
the @entity7 also has contacted 50,000 veterans waiting for care and will continue reaching out to others , @entity131 said after the release of the @entity7 internal audit			1
health care audits told the @entity155 on thursday that such steps , while welcome , failed to address the underlying need for systemic reforms at the @entity7 to instill a culture of serving the veterans , rather than the bureaucracy			1
outside cultural assessment " there is a pervasive @entity7 culture that puts personal gain in the system ahead of veterans			2
that 's wrong , " said @entity168 , president of @entity169			0
saying more than " band - aids " were needed , @entity168 added that " any long - term solution must include a culture and organizational assessment from the outside			0
" @entity176 , a conservative health care activist known for her opposition to president @entity180 's health care reforms , complained the @entity118 legislation included provisions that would undermine the intended goal of letting veterans access civilian medical facilities			0
@entity176 , the former lieutenant governor of @entity186 , pointed out that veterans would need to prove they had experienced unacceptable waits for @entity7 care , and that any private doctor treating them would have to first call the @entity7 for authorization			1
noting the bureaucratic dysfunction at the department , she said : " good luck getting anybody to answer that call			0
" @entity28 , the @entity7 's acting under secretary for health , insisted the @entity7 had the capacity to handle the system proposed in the @entity118 legislation , though he acknowledged that problems occurred at some facilities			2
the @entity7 legislation was moving quickly through @entity15 , showing the political sensitivity of the issue in an election year defined by partisan divide			0
@entity13 minority leader @entity209 signaled thursday that a final compromise must leave intact the government role of providing health care for veterans instead of privatizing it , as sought by @entity215 conservatives			1
vets could get care outside @entity7 under bill passed by @entity13 do bonuses promote cheating ? @entity1 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			1

@entity13 panel looks at organizational causes of @entity7 problems
@entity228 official : " you deserve better from us "
experts : @entity7 needs to focus on veterans , not bureaucracy
@entity13 minority leader @entity209 : compromise on @entity7 bill ca *n't* privatize veterans ' care
