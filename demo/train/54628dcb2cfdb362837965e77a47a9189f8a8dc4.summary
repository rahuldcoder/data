would you dare to freeze yourself fit by stepping into a chilling chamber colder than @entity3 ? golfers are used to frosty fairways , stormy tees and soggy greens but @entity8 is taking the plunge with a real deep freeze			1
@entity12 's three - time major winner is following in the chilling footsteps of actor @entity14 and super-fit soccer star @entity15 by exposing himself to cryotherapy in preparation for the 2015 season			1
" i 've used whole body cryotherapy for several years , " @entity8 commented to @entity1			1
" guided by research from @entity23 , it 's played a key part in my recovery , especially between competitive periods			1
" cryotherapy translates as cold cure -- but for some the intense chill goes beyond words			2
" the cold floods your brain and you ca n't process much more than putting one foot in front of another , " @entity31 , a columnist for the @entity32 , recalls of his experience in the chiller			0
" your body is in revolt and wo n't allow you to relax			0
it 's so different , to be that cold , that i had a real notion of what people mean when they refer to a hostile environment -- but that only came afterwards , when i was outside			2
" chill with a thrill for others , cryotherapy is an ecstatic chill with a thrill			2
" i call it ' legal doping , ' says @entity55 , who runs @entity57 's only cryotherapy center			1
" when you come out you feel so euphoric			0
" those brave enough to enter the cryotherapy chamber expose themselves to tingling temperatures of -130 degrees @entity63			1
that makes @entity3 -- where @entity65 recorded the coldest spot on earth as -92 degrees @entity68 at the end of december 2013 -- officially warmer			1
there are two types of cryotherapy treatments -- whole body and partial exposure -- but both involve serious sub-zero temperatures			2
" it 's not like sticking your hand in an ice bucket or taking an ice bath -- this is extreme cold , " @entity77 , @entity8 's fitness coach and a world leading expert in cryotherapy , tells @entity1			1
" whole body exposure is like stepping into a butcher 's fridge			2
partial exposure is more like entering a suntan cabin where the top of the head stays out of the cold			0
" @entity8 loves the challenge of taking whole body cryotherapy			1
he 's a heavy worker			2
" he has a huge practice and training regime			2
part and parcel of the recovery process for him is cryotherapy			1
" the drafty drill sees @entity12 's double @entity105 @entity104 champion enter a tardis like chamber , which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to temperatures between -120 and -140 degrees @entity68			1
he will then experience what 's known as a " short exposure " which lasts for two to three minutes			2
@entity112 was developed in 1978 by @entity113 in @entity114 but is a relatively new treatment in professional sports medicine			1
the @entity117 in the @entity119 village of @entity120 helped the treatment spread west			2
@entity127 , in his role as director of fitness for the @entity126 , immersed his squad of international players in @entity131 's cryotherapy chamber in 2001			1
the respected @entity133 coach claims they were the first sports team in the world to formally use the facilities			0
@entity127 imported cryotherapy to @entity12 and watched the freeze become a fashion			1
" it 's now taken off big time in @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 and @entity145 , " he adds			2
" the @entity146 had no treatment centers in 2006 but now there are a couple of hundred			2
" but what are the effects of the big chill ? cryotherapy has two main benefits for maxed out sporting stars -- helping speed up the body 's recovery after intense training and promoting a deeper sleep			1
" part of our investigations included taking serum and blood tests to monitor enzymes related to muscle damage , " explains @entity127 , who ran a research program into cryotherapy			1
" what we saw is that they returned to normal when players took part in cryotherapy compared to when they did n't			1
it improved the inflammatory response , which led to a better recovery			0
" we 've also seen heart rate variability -- which is a marker of stress -- returned to the baseline quicker if the athlete is exposed to cryotherapy			0
" we noticed that sleep quality is also improved straight away by an exposure to cryotherapy			0
" individual athletes would report , ' i just had a good , deep sleep and i feel very good			1
' it 's also possible to get a quality of sleep number by attaching a monitor to the wrist			0
" in a four - year study of 156 rugby players , 95 % said cryotherapy had a positive effect on their recovery after training			1
" many of those that take it will tell you afterwards that they feel elated , they feel a rush of energy and a high as happy hormones are released , " adds @entity201			0
mobile freezer traditional cryotherapy chambers , with three rooms of gradually dropping temperatures , are an expensive and unwieldy piece kit -- not the sort of thing you can pack on the team bus			0
but cryotherapy has now gone mobile which means sports stars can order a deep freeze almost as easily as a hot takeaway			1
" having the unit on the road and available on a rental basis is opening cryotherapy up to an awful lot more people , " @entity226 , managing director of cryotherapy consultants @entity226 , tells @entity1			0
in 2013 , @entity226 conceived the first mobile full body cryotherapy unit in the @entity105 , which is owned and operated by medical and industrial gases specialist @entity235			0
his clients include @entity240 teams @entity238 and @entity241 as well as rugby union clubs such as @entity243 and @entity244			0
" you can get a whole squad through the mobile unit in a day , " @entity226 explains " the @entity249 rugby players used it before their tour of @entity251 last year and did three treatments a day			0
" they were dragging the guys out of bed before breakfast sticking them through cryo , they 'd do some gym work in the morning , then go in for another session before lunch , do some work on the pitch and then another treatment at the end of the day			0
" the mobile unit is predominantly used to stimulate a quicker recovery after training or games			0
" it costs up to $ 1,500 to hire the six - meter long unit for a day in the deep freeze			1
" we find our bookings come in around the @entity274 fixtures , " says @entity226			0
" it was in heavy use over the @entity278 period because there was such a heavy football program			0
" cryotherapy is not only the domain of fatigued footballers , its frosty fingers are also spreading to the high street			1
legal doping the @entity288 center offers @entity57 either a blast in its so - called " cryosauna " or a local treatment -- increasingly used as part of a beauty regime to firm up skin -- where vaporized liquid nitrogen is blown over a specific part of the body			1
" it is a growing industry , " chairman @entity55 , who brought cryotherapy to @entity57 after receiving revelatory treatment in @entity119 on his injured right knee , tells @entity1			1
" there are a lot of famous people in the entertainment industry -- like actors @entity305 and @entity307 -- and from the athletic world who use our center , so that has increased cryotherapy 's popularity			2
" professional sports teams like the @entity316 have a couple of machines which has also helped awareness			0
" you do n't necessarily need a @entity322 salary to try cryotherapy -- it 's probably cheaper than courtside @entity316 tickets too -- because an icy blast in @entity288 's cryosauna costs $ 90			2
if the price continues to drop , along with the temperatures , is there a chance that cryotherapy will become as normal as having a sports massage or a protein shake ? " yes , i truly believe so , " says @entity55			0
" particularly the local treatment which is cheaper and less intimidating			0
" i call cryotherapy legal doping because it boosts your energy levels and it makes your more alert			1
it increases your neuro - muscular response , so you react a little faster , and your immune system is activated			0
" it boosts metabolism , which is also useful for weight loss , but it also stimulates your endocrine system so it relaxes you			0
" i pretty much do it every day now , " says @entity55 cheerily			0
" you should try it			0
