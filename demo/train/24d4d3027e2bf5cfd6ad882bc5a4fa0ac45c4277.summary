-- removing a stranded @entity3 minesweeper from an environmentally delicate reef off the @entity5 may take until april , the state - run @entity1 reported wednesday , citing the @entity5 @entity6			1
the @entity7 is preparing to extract the @entity8 from the @entity9 , a @entity5 national park and @entity10 where the 224 - foot - long ship ran aground on january 17			1
the @entity7 plans to cut the 1,312 - ton minesweeper into pieces and then , with the help of two contracted crane ships , lift the pieces and carry them away			1
@entity5 coast guard rear adm. @entity18 said wednesday that he hopes the salvaging will begin soon so that further damage to the reef will be limited , the @entity1 said			1
one of the crane ships has arrived in the area , about 80 miles east - southeast of @entity25 in the @entity26 , and the other is on its way , the news agency reported			2
@entity7 spokesman : @entity31 's location misplaced on chart the ship is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters ( about 43,000 square feet ) of the reef , the news agency said			1
various @entity3 officials , including navy vice adm. @entity37 last month , have apologized to the @entity5 for the incident , which the @entity7 and the @entity5 @entity6 are investigating			1
@entity5 officials said last month that the country would seek compensation for reef damage			1
the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity5 , @entity44 , assured the @entity5 on monday that the @entity3 " will provide appropriate compensation for damage to the reef caused by the ship			1
" the reef is home to a vast array of sea , air and land creatures , as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands			2
about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there , as can whales , dolphins , sharks , turtles and breeding seabirds , according to @entity67			2
originally , only the ship 's bow was on the reef , but waves pushed the entire ship onto it			2
the ship 's wood - and - fiberglass hull was penetrated , allowing a significant amount of water into the ship , the @entity7 said			1
crews have been working to remove hazardous materials from the vessel and anything that could still be useful to the @entity7			2
the @entity7 has reported no oil slicks ; the ship 's 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel have been removed			1
one of the environmental concerns is that algae will grow on dead or scarred corals , park superintendent @entity86 said			0
" their presence makes it hard for other corals to regenerate as they cover the substrate , " @entity86 wrote in an e-mail to @entity0 on wednesday			0
" we expect an increase in the incidence of grazer fish species in the area that feed on the algae			0
hopefully they are hungry enough to control algae populations to enable hard corals ( to ) take root in the substrate			0
" so you see , the balance we have been trying to maintain has been upset			0
for that particular area at least , coral evolution starts all over again -- but not until salvage operations are over			0
" the salvage operation also may hurt tourism , because it will happen at the start of the park 's main tourism window of march to early june , @entity86 said			0
@entity86 said she has n't heard of any pre-booked tourists canceling			0
but the park , which is celebrating its 25th year , will have to close two of its 15 major diving sites during the operation , she said			0
" we will not ( be ) able to offer divers the full measure of the @entity9 experience , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
