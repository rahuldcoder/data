-- for her long and impressive résumé of independent films like " @entity4 , " " party girl , " and " @entity7 , " @entity6 is often referred to as the " @entity6			1
" though much of her work in recent years has focused on memorable television roles , the @entity11 native returns to the big screen in @entity14 's " @entity13			1
" in the film , which debuts in select theaters on november 16 and is available for rental on @entity18			1
@entity6 plays " @entity22 , " a powerful marketing executive overseeing a chain of grocery stores			1
for fans who have grown to love @entity6 's trademark dry wit and pitch perfect edginess , @entity22 lands squarely in the wheelhouse			1
in her war to take over corporate america , @entity22 faces off with a man at every turn			2
part genius , part sociopath , part seductress , @entity22 uses her full arsenal of @entity36 - given weapons -- from sexual manipulation to full blown tempter tantrums -- to get what she wants			2
during a recent conversation with @entity0 , @entity6 discussed her new role , explained her take on the public 's misconceptions about working in @entity44 and confessed the whoops moment that just may have cost her @entity47 's @entity46			1
@entity0 : my first impression of you is that you 're fearless			2
are you fearless ? @entity6 : you know , i do n't really see myself that way			1
i 've been doing this now professionally for 20 years			2
is n't that wild ? i think the perception is when you 're famous you pick and choose your own material , but , honestly the material comes to me and i do n't feel like i do n't have much of a choice at all			2
so , when something is good , i end up doing it			2
but , i do like to show things that maybe most people would n't want to show of themselves , where people can judge you and you 're not perfect			2
so , maybe that 's where you 're getting that kind of fearlessness			2
@entity0 : the character you play in " @entity13 " certainly falls in this category			1
@entity6 : there are things about " @entity22 " that i think are very of this time right now			1
i 've certainly seen women like this that are very entitled and powerful and manipulative and seductive			1
@entity0 : she 's a woman dominating a man 's world but with what most would consider typically masculine traits			2
@entity6 : those characteristics excited me ! i do n't read parts like that that have those levels - someone who 's powerful and also someone who 's a loose canon			1
she has a really strong appetite , even more than these men that are around her and she 's hungry for more ! one of the first ideas or images i had for her was @entity97 from " @entity98			2
" her female powers are n't female , they are totally male			0
and she does n't have those things that make a woman powerful like vulnerability and sensitivity and intuition			1
she takes and she demands			0
@entity0 : she even demands fun			0
i love the @entity108 scene when she keeps saying everyone is going to have fun , but clearly has no idea what fun is			0
@entity6 : i did n't even think about that			1
she 's all about planned fun			0
it 's not like that in other countries			0
does n't that seem like a very @entity121 thing to do ? @entity0 : i have heard that before , yes			0
we 're a very type - a culture			0
but , you seem like a woman who knows how to have a good time			0
what brings you the most joy these days ? @entity6 : it 's a really laid - back thing like cooking or having friends over and just talking			1
i like a one - on - one with a friend , really deep conversations			0
@entity0 : are you and your friends talking about the election at all ? @entity6 : well , it 's all kind of unsettling what we 're seeing right now being played out			1
this drama ! that it becomes entertainment , that it becomes a game			0
i ca n't really watch it , i just get too , there 's so much that needs to be done , i get kind of down about politics			0
i do n't have the stomach to usually watch it			0
@entity0 : there 's a lot of attention being paid to women 's health			0
@entity6 : yeah , yeah , i think we 're in the ' 50s			1
i think we 're at very conservative times as women , as individuals			0
@entity0 : i wonder what @entity22 's reaction would be to all the men talking about women 's issues			0
@entity6 : i think she 'd be really mad			1
then , she would run for president			0
@entity0 : ( laughter ) @entity22 is just the latest of many roles you 've made famous , but was there ever a part you passed on and then regretted later ? @entity6 : what i did pass on that may surprise you is " girl interrupted			1
and she won the @entity46 ! is n't that funny ? @entity0 : oh , i could definitely see you in that role			1
why did you pass ? @entity6 : i just did n't care enough about it			1
there was something about it			0
they probably wanted me to audition and i did n't feel like doing it , or maybe they wanted me to jump through hoops and i did n't feel like doing it			0
honestly , i just did n't care about it enough to be grounded in it .			0
