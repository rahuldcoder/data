@entity0 -- thousands of @entity2 filled evacuation shelters or joined foreigners seeking a way out of the country thursday in the aftermath of last week 's devastating earthquake , tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis at stricken reactors			2
cold , snowy weather in parts of the @entity15 nation further heightened the hardship of a nation facing what its leaders call its biggest disaster since @entity21 fears of possible nuclear catastrophe were evident			0
after rallying wednesday , stocks in @entity2 fell early thursday , with the nikkei 225 index , the most prominent measure of stocks traded in @entity0 , down about 2 % in early trading			0
concerns spread far beyond @entity2 's borders , with @entity32 stock markets falling and the @entity32 military dispatching a radiation - sniffing aircraft to determine if toxic clouds were rising from disabled reactors			1
nearly 13,000 people are dead or missing and several hundred thousand have been left homeless from friday 's earthquake and tsunami			1
an extraordinary television address wednesday by @entity41 showed the magnitude of the catastrophe			0
such a speech by a sitting emperor is usually reserved for times of extreme crisis or war , and @entity41 's direct appeal to the public was the first time he has spoken to the public amid such a crisis			1
" i truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope , take care of themselves , and live strong for tomorrow , " said the dignified and understated @entity41 , in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the @entity55			0
" also , i want all citizens of @entity2 to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation , not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery			1
" the 77 - year - old ceremonial but deeply revered chief of state underlined prime minister @entity67 's earlier assertion that @entity2 is going through its worst crisis since @entity21 the emperor delivered his speech on the same day that white smoke and a new blaze at the damaged @entity74 nuclear plant added to radiation fears			1
" currently , the entire nation is putting forth its best effort to save all suffering people			0
however , under the severe cold weather , evacuees are having a very difficult time because they lack food , water , and energy sources , " he said			2
" also , i am deeply concerned that the current nuclear plant situation is critical			2
i truly hope that with so many people working together to help , the situation will not worsen			0
" on thursday morning , helicopters operated by @entity2 's self - defense forces made four passes over the plant 's no. 3 reactor to dump water			1
public broadcaster @entity95 reported that at least 12 water - cannon trucks would be brought in , so that forces could try to douse the reactor from the ground , while @entity2 has called for anyone living within 12 miles of the disable nuclear plant to evacuate , @entity103 and the @entity32 dramatically expanded their evacuation warnings wednesday , telling their respective citizens within 50 miles to either stay indoors or move away			1
it was the first time since the nuclear crisis began that the @entity32 and @entity2 governments have differed on advising what their citizens should do			1
before wednesday , the @entity32 had urged @entity32 citizens in @entity2 to follow the recommendations of the @entity2 government			1
a cloud of smoke seen at the stricken plant sparked fear there might have been a breach in the containment vessel in the nuclear plant 's no. 3 reactor , government officials said			1
earlier explosions and fires also had hit other reactors at the plant			2
officials asked workers at the plant to evacuate wednesday after the cloud rose above the plant and radiation levels spiked			1
the levels later fell and authorities allowed the workers to return , the @entity135 said			0
tests on tap water in @entity142 , 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) away found radiation -- though at levels not harmful to the human body , and later tests showed no radiation in the water , government officials said			1
officials have been working to resolve cooling problems at four of @entity74 's six reactors in the wake of the 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami			1
@entity2 authorities could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at the troubled reactors			0
workers have been pumping sea water into reactors in an effort to prevent further damage			2
a meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods can not be cooled , thus melting the reactor core and causing a release of radioactivity			2
in the worst - case scenario , the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread toxic radioactivity through the air and water			2
that , public health officials say , can cause both immediate and long - term health problems , including radiation poisoning and cancer			0
as the government and workers scrambled to stabilize the plant , the search continued for survivors from last week 's cruel combination of natural disasters			1
by wednesday night , the @entity187 reported 4,314 deaths			0
another 8,606 people are missing and 2,282 were injured , the agency said			2
the number of dead is expected to go up as rescuers reach more hard - hit areas			2
public broadcaster @entity95 has reported that 450,000 people were living in shelters , where people grieved over lost loved ones and worried about relatives who are missing from villages and towns inundated by the tsunami waves off the east coast of @entity205			2
thousands of people packed @entity207 in @entity0 , with some sitting on floors			0
" we just headed for the mountains directly away from the nuclear power station , " @entity213 , who lives about 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) from the @entity74 plant			1
he said he is " taking no chances " with his baby son			0
@entity217 of @entity218 -- about 210 kilometers ( 130 miles ) from the nuclear plant -- decided to travel across the country to @entity222 prefecture -- a location he admits is ironic			1
@entity32 planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of @entity227 during @entity21 ' we thought that the reactor is not safe and too near , " @entity217 said			1
" plus , if the panic spreads , we will be unable to leave @entity2 and get the full exposure sitting on our sofa			0
" meanwhile , across the country , emergency workers from @entity2 , foreign governments and international aid groups continued to scour tangled and displaced piles of debris , searching for survivors			0
scores of countries , regions and international organizations have offered assistance , according to the @entity2 foreign affairs ministry			0
rescue work is being complicated by the hundreds of aftershocks that have rocked @entity2 since friday 's quake			2
since the initial earthquake , the @entity248 has reported about 35 quakes with magnitudes of 6.0 or greater , and more than 200 others greater than 5.0			0
@entity253 , the @entity32 ambassador to @entity2 , said the @entity32 military has delivered over 7,000 pounds of food and water to the disaster area so far and more than $ 5.8 million of @entity32 aid has come to @entity2			1
he said nine @entity32 ships are assisting in the relief operations , and helicopters and other aircraft have now flown over 50 missions to conduct survivor recoveries , transport passengers , and distribute food and water supplies in the most needy areas			1
@entity271 is pledging $ 1 million in cash and " in - kind support " to disaster relief efforts , for example			0
meanwhile , the crisis has rekindled debate and concern over nuclear power			0
energy secretary @entity280 told members of @entity282 wednesday that the @entity284 @entity283 still backs the further development of @entity32 nuclear power -- a stance opposed by some key congressional democrats			1
@entity290 prime minister @entity289 announced wednesday that the government will review safety at all of @entity290 's nuclear power plants			0
the massive quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit @entity2 , according to @entity248 records that date to 1900			0
@entity1 's @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 contributed to this report .			0
