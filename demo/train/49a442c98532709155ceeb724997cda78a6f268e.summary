-- homeland security secretary @entity1 unveiled a $ 700 million plan on tuesday to help @entity3 fight violent drug cartels , which includes a @entity6 crackdown on the flow of weapons and money into @entity3			1
homeland security secretary @entity1 says the @entity11 plan will address demand and border security			1
the move sets the stage for visits to @entity3 by three administration @entity18 members , starting tomorrow with secretary of state @entity19 , in an effort to stem drug - related violence and prevent it from spilling into the @entity6			1
@entity0 's @entity22 spoke with @entity23 on tuesday about the @entity6 ' involvement in the @entity3 government 's war against drug cartels and the @entity6 ' stake in the conflict			1
@entity22 : well , i want to get right to it because we 'll never be able to defeat the drug lords until our own demand for drugs here in the @entity6 is curbed			1
i mean , it is our consumption in the @entity6 that fuels the drug lord production			1
so , what are you going to do to decrease that demand ? @entity1 : well , the whole package we announced today is not only about enforcement and stopping the flow of drugs into the @entity6 and helping @entity3 against these very brutal cartels , but it includes money for more drug courts and reduction in demand			1
so , we look forward to working on the demand side as well as the supply side , but i 'll tell you , where the @entity11 is concerned , it 's all about border safety and security and making sure that spillover violence does not erupt in our own country			1
@entity22 : we 're talking about more than 200 cities , cities that we 'd never think of , like @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 [ @entity65 ]			0
i mean , what about the people right now that are dealing with sexual abuse , murder , house invasions , kidnapping ? @entity23 : that 's right			1
what is happening , for those who do n't live on the border , is that there are some large drug cartels			0
they 've been in @entity3 for a long time , but they 've gotten larger and more powerful			1
the president of @entity3 has said , enough			1
and he is really going after those cartels			0
we 've been clamping down on the land border , so the cartels simultaneously are fighting each other over ever - diminishing turf and they 're fighting the federal government of @entity3			1
and that 's what 's caused 6,000 homicides in @entity3 -- northern @entity3 last year -- 550 of which were law enforcement or public officials who were assassinated by the cartels			2
but the cartels got so big and powerful because they were bringing tonnage loads of cocaine and other illegal drugs into our country , and their organizations ultimately went to supply those who are using illegal drugs in places like @entity62 and places -- other places where you would n't think of having any connection with these big cartels			0
we want to shut those cartels down			0
@entity22 : well , there are a lot of leaders here in the @entity6 that say it 's been -- we 've helped those cartels			2
we 've actually helped fuel the problem			0
and if you look at [ @entity123 ] @entity122 [ @entity124 ] , chairman of the @entity125 , he said the drugs are coming north , and we 're sending money and guns south			2
and as a result , these cartels have gained extraordinary power			0
and he also added , about 90 percent of guns seized in @entity3 raids are traced back to the @entity6 , about 2,000 firearms cross the border into @entity3 daily			1
@entity23 : well , it 's a significant number of the guns used in this wave of violence in northern @entity3 absolutely come from the @entity6			1
that 's why part of our plan is increasing the number of agents who are going to inspect southbound vehicles			1
that 's why we 're sending technology to the border that will allow us to scan or do noninvasive x-rays to see whether cars are carrying assault weapons , other kinds of weapons that are now flowing into @entity3 to fuel these drug cartels			1
and to find these huge truckloads , basically , of cash that are garnered in the @entity6 and sent to @entity3			1
this is a strategy that we are -- have used in certain places			0
now we 're employing it border wide			0
@entity22 : so , madam secretary , let me ask you about the military			0
for example , we 've covered the city of @entity170 , @entity3			2
you know how bad of a place that has been			0
brutal murders , sexual abuse against women , people being beheaded , kidnapped			0
i mean , just ruthless cartel activity			0
and what did @entity3 do ? they took 5,000 military troops , 1,200 federal police officers and just about bombarded @entity170			2
and so , now they 've seen a drop in these drug - related killings			0
it 's sort of like what we saw in @entity186 , you know , putting in troop surges into certain areas , and you saw a drop in violence			2
would you ever consider doing something like that , getting the military involved and saying , ok , we ca n't take this anymore , we 've got to do something drastic or it wo n't work ? @entity23 : well , obviously , the violence problem in @entity170 was of a different quality and kind than anything we 've seen in the @entity6			1
and it really did demand that kind of response by the federal government in @entity3			1
we have contingency plans on the @entity6 side			2
and we 're still evaluating a request that we do send some @entity210 to some of the border areas			1
we 're still looking at that			0
but you know , that clampdown in @entity3 , in @entity170 in particular , was really called for			2
the homicide situation there was out of control			0
@entity22 : let 's talk about @entity220 , the former @entity221 [ @entity222 ] police chief			0
[ president ] @entity224 has selected him to be the drug czar for all of you			0
he has n't been confirmed yet			0
but what does he know about dealing with cartels who have mastered kidnapping and beheadings and are using grenades and other forms of firepower , quite frankly , that is far greater than a lot of police forces we have in the @entity6 ? @entity23 : well , he 's a police chief , and police chiefs know a lot about a lot of different things			1
and as you yourself pointed out , these drug cartels have fingers that reach all over the @entity6 , including into communities like @entity221			2
so , he 'll come into that job , assuming he 's confirmed , with a knowledge base , and also a knowledge base about what the use of illegal drugs is doing to people , does to families , does to our neighborhoods , our communities			0
that 's why we need to work on the demand side as well as the supply side through these cartels			0
@entity22 : homeland security secretary @entity1 , we 'll definitely follow your efforts			0
@entity23 : thank you so much .			2
