@entity0 -- when @entity3 came to @entity4 from @entity5 , a postage stamp cost 3 cents and kids were clamoring for a new toy called mr. @entity8			1
on wednesday , almost 57 years later , @entity3 became the longest - serving member of @entity4 in history			1
two days before he turns 92 , the eloquent legislator known for his encyclopedic knowledge of @entity14 rules and history surpasses @entity16 , the @entity18 @entity17 who served a total of 20,773 days in the @entity20 and @entity14			1
with his 20,774th day representing @entity5 -- six years in @entity21 and then nearly 51 years and counting in the @entity14 -- @entity3 sets a record for longevity unlikely to be broken as the political climate turns toward term limits and growing public dissatisfaction with @entity4			1
in a statement issued by his office , @entity3 expressed his gratitude to " the people of the great @entity5 " for their long - standing confidence in him			1
his only regret , he said , was that his wife , @entity34 , who died in 2006 , would not be with him			0
" i know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying congratulations my dear @entity3 -- but do n't let it go to your head , " @entity3 's statement said			2
in a career representing the @entity5 coal - mining country from which he emerged , @entity3 has cast more @entity14 votes ( 18,000 - plus ) and held more leadership positions ( including two stints as majority leader ) than any other senator			1
he has never lost an election			0
he was raised by an aunt and uncle after his mother died when he was a year old , and he did not graduate college until he received a degree in 1994 from @entity55			0
in a sign of his @entity58 roots , @entity3 was an avid fiddle player and appeared twice on the television program " @entity60			2
" he gave up playing in the 1980s because of a tremor in his hands			0
his early political years displayed some of the deeply rooted racism of the @entity66			0
@entity3 was a member of the white supremacist @entity68 in the early 1940s , and later called it " the most egregious mistake i 've ever made			1
" in 1964 , he voted against the @entity71 pushed by @entity73 president @entity72			0
but @entity3 later followed a more traditional @entity73 path			2
an ardent foe of president @entity77 's policies in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , @entity3 opposed creating the @entity80 in 2002 and called @entity77 " dangerous , reckless and arrogant " in february 2003 , six weeks before the @entity82 war started			2
three months later , he criticized @entity77 's landing a jet on the @entity85 to signal the end of the @entity82 war as " flamboyant showmanship			0
" on june 12 , 2006 , @entity3 became the longest serving senator in history , and was re-elected to his ninth consecutive @entity14 term five months later			1
things have changed since he arrived in @entity0 as a new congressman in 1953 , along with the first @entity94 administration			1
gas cost 20 cents a gallon then , and the average annual salary was less than $ 4,000			1
ten presidents later , @entity3 is known for his devotion to his state and constituents			0
" his number one priority has always been the people of @entity5 , " senate majority leader @entity102 , @entity103 , says in a statement on @entity3 's @entity14 web site			1
" it has been a great example for all of us to never lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from your state and the people in your state should have first priority			0
" @entity3 's statement marking wednesday 's achievement reflected that thinking			0
" although we are marking a longevity milestone , it has been the quality and dedication of service that has guided me over the years , " @entity3 said in his statement			2
" i have strived to provide the people of @entity5 the best representation possible each of the 20,774 days which i have served in the @entity4			1
" he thanked his constituents for their support and for " putting their trust and faith in me			0
" slowed by illness in recent years , including a six - week hospital stay this year because of a staph infection , @entity3 concluded his statement with typical bravado			2
" the only way for me to close on this historic day is to say that i look forward to serving you for the next 56 years and 320 days , " he said			0
" thank you and may @entity143 bless you			0
