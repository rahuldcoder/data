-- the mainland @entity4 , which was largely recovering monday from a near - nationwide heat wave , has experienced the warmest 12 months since record - keeping began in 1895 , a top government science and weather agency announced monday			1
the report from the @entity8 , which is part of the @entity10 , does not take into account blistering heat from this month , with 2,116 high temperature marks either broken or tied between july 2 and july 8 in communities nationwide			1
share your heat photos and videos on @entity18 but it does incorporate the warmest march recorded as well as extreme heat in june , which also helped make the first six months of 2012 the warmest recorded of any january - june stretch			1
in the last half of june , 170 all - time temperature records were matched or smashed in cities across the lower 48 states			1
the @entity27 also is reviewing whether 113 - degree temperatures in @entity29 and 112 - degree recordings in @entity31 qualify as all - time records in those two states			1
@entity34 heats up as rest of @entity4 cools down " there are a lot of things going on that have been very unusual over the last several months , " said @entity36 , earth and atmospheric sciences professor at @entity39			0
that includes an outbreak of particularly large wildfires in @entity46 , which had its warmest june ever , according to @entity10			1
most of that state is experiencing extreme to exceptional drought , which is also true in places as far afield as @entity51 and @entity31 , according to the @entity52 , run out of the @entity53			1
that 's a pressing problem in @entity55 , where @entity36 is the state climatologist and where the @entity56 says conditions in central and southern parts of the state " resemble the @entity57 days of the 1930s			0
" @entity36 said it is " very hard to root out " the role played by short - term weather patterns and longer - term trends in creating conditions recorded over a given stretch , such as the period from june 2011 to june 2012 measured by @entity10			1
but he said , " they 're all tied together " and can contribute to major issues , pointing specifically to the interdependent relationship between heat and drought			2
" that is an intriguing and fairly dangerous kind of event that obviously has affects on humans , " he said , referring to drought			0
the average temperature for the @entity4 mainland in june was 71.2 degrees -- 2 degrees above the 20th - century average			1
it was the 14th warmest june on record			2
besides the @entity84 and @entity83 , coastal states have also felt the heat of late : @entity87 , for instance , has experienced 16 straight months ( not including data from june ) in which average monthly temperatures measured above normal			1
stepping back further in time , 2010 tied with 2005 as the warmest ever , based on global surface temperatures , according to @entity10			1
in fact , a march report from the @entity93 noted that " climate change has led to changes in climate extremes such as heat waves , record high temperatures and , in many regions , heavy precipitation in the past half - century			1
" triple - digit strategies for staying healthy millions in the central and eastern @entity4 who experienced the latest heat wave got somewhat of a reprieve monday			1
but the break in the heat also brought severe storms to some areas			2
the cold front , while welcome , prompted a series of thunderstorm warnings late monday afternoon and into the evening from @entity114 south to @entity31			0
the @entity56 warned of potentially " quarter - size hail and damaging winds in excess of 60 mph			2
" there were few indications , by 9:30 p.m. , that these storms packed anywhere near the wallop of those from late june			0
but they did affect some trees and bring torrential rain in spots			0
flash floods left as much as five inches of rain in downtown @entity130 , @entity131 , on monday night , said @entity132 , a meteorologist at the @entity56 's @entity134 bureau			1
" motorists are encouraged to stay off the roads , if possible , " the city said in a press release noting two road closures			0
nearby on @entity140 , between 20 to 30 cars were stranded due to flooding rains , said @entity132			1
one upside to the front moving through was much cooler temperatures			2
high temperatures monday were in the 80s in cities including @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , where temperatures on sunday hit 102 degrees and surpassed 95 for the 11th straight day			2
even the 91 degrees recorded monday in @entity155 was a welcome relief			0
this cool - down follows a heat wave that roasted much of the country for more than a week and contributed to dozens of heat - related deaths , including 18 in @entity161 and 10 in @entity114 , according to state officials			2
millions also lost power at one point or another , many of them for several days , because of severe storms that swept east from @entity55 to the @entity169 states starting on june 29			0
as of monday afternoon , just under 100,000 customers in 11 states and metropolitan @entity152 still lacked electricity			0
@entity173 brace for storms , aftermath on sunday damaging winds struck @entity177 , @entity114 , and collapsed a building , injuring two people , according to the @entity56 's @entity180			0
the storms have complicated power restoration efforts in some spots and caused even more damage			0
one person died saturday in storms in @entity188 , @entity189 , the prediction center said			0
" it has been a tough few weeks for many @entity173 , " @entity114 gov. @entity190 said late sunday			0
" they have suffered from record - breaking temperatures and an historic storm that brought widespread damage and power outages			1
now , many have lost power again			0
i ask @entity173 to remain patient and to continue to help each other get through this latest storm			0
" still , even as the @entity84 , @entity202 and @entity203 cool a bit , the @entity34 is practically boiling			0
the @entity56 has issued excessive heat warnings for parts of @entity51 and @entity207 through wednesday , with temperatures forecast to peak tuesday at 114 degrees in @entity209 ; 113 in @entity210 ; 116 degrees in @entity211 , @entity51 ; and 125 degrees in @entity212 , @entity207			1
