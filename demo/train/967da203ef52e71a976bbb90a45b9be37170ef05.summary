@entity0 , @entity1 -- pharmacies in @entity1 and @entity5 are at the heart of an illicit nationwide network providing prescription drugs over the internet , federal agents state in court papers filed in two cities			1
in search warrant affidavits obtained by @entity2 , agents said the business was centered around two pharmacies , one in the @entity17 suburb of @entity18 , @entity5 , and the other here in this small town south of @entity21			1
according to the affidavits , both pharmacies are owned by the same man , @entity24 -- the subject of a 2008 report by @entity2			1
one of them , the @entity18 company now called @entity28 , combined with another unidentified pharmacy to ship 30,000 packages of prescription drugs across the country during the first six months of 2010			2
" this is a pretty large ring of at least 200 websites that acted as internet pharmacies that were basically selling drugs -- prescription drugs -- without requiring a valid prescription , " @entity33 , a former official in the @entity34 , told @entity2			1
" these affidavits indicate this was a multiyear , multimillion - dollar operation involving thousands and thousands of prescriptions			1
going back in time , there were even deaths involved with this organization			0
" the affidavits say most of the drugs were highly addictive , especially muscle relaxants called @entity53 and tramadol			1
and the majority of the prescriptions , a government source told @entity2 , were authorized by the same physician , dr. @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity1 , who had never seen or even talked with those ordering the drugs online , according to the documents			1
@entity1 state records show @entity58 's license to dispense controlled drugs was revoked for three years , beginning in 1999 , because he prescribed such substances without following proper procedure			1
he paid a $ 1,000 fine and was again allowed to dispense controlled drugs in 2002			2
his license to practice medicine was not suspended			0
@entity2 's @entity71 first examined @entity72 and @entity73 , the company he owns in @entity0 , in 2008			0
@entity2 correspondent @entity75 ordered the antidepressant @entity76 over the internet without a doctor 's prescription , and the pills were delivered by overnight express the following day			0
the affidavits show federal agents doing essentially the same thing in a series of test buys between 2008 and april 2010 -- ordering drugs from a variety of websites and receiving the pills within a day or two			1
in addition , the agents received dozens of follow - up e-mails encouraging them to purchase more drugs			1
spokesmen for the @entity97 attorney 's offices in both @entity1 and @entity17 declined to comment			2
but former @entity34 official @entity33 , who now is president of an online pharmacy watchdog site called @entity99 , told @entity2 that the cash involved is significant			2
" with approximately 5,000 prescriptions being processed a month , at roughly $ 100 a prescription , that 's at least , what ? a half a million a month being made by this operation alone , " @entity33 told @entity2			2
@entity24 did not return phone calls or answer a knock on his door			0
his lawyer , @entity110 , told @entity2 in an e-mail that he had not had an opportunity to speak with his client about the affidavits			0
@entity2 was able to locate @entity58 , approaching him in his driveway as he arrived home			0
he quickly ordered @entity2 's team to leave			0
" i do n't want to talk now , " he said			0
" now get off the property			0
" @entity58 refused to answer a series of follow - up questions			0
@entity33 told @entity2 that with the affidavits , the @entity122 was attempting a new line of legal reasoning to clamp down on online pharmacies			1
" the @entity122 , for the first time , is saying these are considered unregulated drugs , and that is a violation of the law , " @entity33 said .			0
