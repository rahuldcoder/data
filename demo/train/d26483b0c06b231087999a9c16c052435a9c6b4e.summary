a transgender first - grader who was born a boy but identifies as a girl has won the right to use the girls ' restroom at her @entity7 school			1
the @entity8 ruled in favor of @entity10 in her fight against the @entity12			2
@entity10 's parents had taken her case to the commission after the district said she could no longer use the girls ' bathroom at @entity19			1
in issuing its decision , the state 's rights division said keeping the ban in place " creates an environment that is objectively and subjectively hostile , intimidating or offensive			1
" the @entity26 praised the ruling that was filled under @entity7 's @entity28			1
@entity29 , the group 's executive director , called the ruling " a high - water mark for transgender rights			2
" this is the first of it 's kind ruling in the country regarding the rights of transgender students			2
no court , no tribunal has ever said what the @entity41 of @entity42 has said today which is that trangendered students must be treated equally			0
they specifically referenced the outmoded concept of separate but equal and told us that separate but equal is very rarely equal and it is certainly not equal in @entity10 's case			1
@entity10 's mother , @entity50 , said she 's pleased that @entity10 can return to school and put this behind her			1
the first - grader has been home schooled during the proceedings " we 're very thrilled that @entity10 is able to return to school and have the same rights that all the other girls had , that she should have had and was afforded by law to begin with			1
we 're extremely happy that she 's going to be treated equally and we thank the civil rights division for coming to this conclusion , " @entity50 said			2
" we 're very grateful to the voters of @entity7 for putting its laws into place to begin with			2
" a girl 's life for most of the past year , @entity10 has dressed as a girl			1

the district " took into account not only @entity10 , but other students in the building , their parents and the future impact a boy with male genitals using a girls ' bathroom would have as @entity10 grew older , " a letter the family 's attorney received in december said			1
" however , i 'm certain you can appreciate that , as @entity10 grows older and his male genitals develop along with the rest of his body , at least some parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his continued use of the girls ' restroom			1
" @entity114 was unable to reach the school district early monday for comment on the ruling			2
but in february , the district 's attorney , @entity118 , said : " the district firmly believes it has acted reasonably and fairly with respect to this issue			2

born female , @entity140 underwent a transition in his 40s to become a man			0
he wrote in his book " transition " that , even as a child , he had been " aware of a part of me that did not fit			0
" he appeared last year as a man on " @entity155 , " in part , he said , to destigmatize being transgender			0

many transgender people report feeling discomfort with their gender as early as they can remember			0
transgender job seekers face uphill battle gender identity is often confused with sexual orientation			0
the difference is that " gender identity is who you are , and sexual orientation is who you want to have sex with , " said dr. @entity198 , a professor of clinical pediatrics at the @entity200 , who treats transgender children			0
children around age 3 are probably not interested in sexual orientation , she said			0

in @entity216 , for example , the law says students ca n't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity			0
but in @entity221 , a court ruled in november that a school district did not violate a transgender student 's rights when she was told she could n't use the girls ' bathroom			1
gender nonconformity is not a disorder , group says dude , the @entity7 school district 's attorney , has said there is nothing in that state requiring public schools to permit transgender students to use restrooms intended for the gender with which they identify			1
at the time , he argued that the @entity12 adheres to the @entity239 in all respects : " @entity10 attends class as all other students , is permitted to wear girls ' clothes and is referred to as the parents have requested			1
" on monday , @entity29 underscored what he described as the unfairness of @entity10 's situation			1
" by denying @entity10 the right to use the little girls restroom like all the other little girls at school it had created an environment that was hostile , discriminatory and unsafe			1
@entity10 was treated in what was referred to as an exceptional way , which limited her educational opportunities			2
in the end , we 've been saying from the start , that @entity10 wants the same dignity , respect and opportunity , and deserves that , as every other student in @entity7			1
the state of @entity7 has now said that 's exactly what she deserves , " @entity29 said			2
