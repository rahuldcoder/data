-- for most of us , watching a fly mindlessly bouncing against a window in an effort to escape , is pretty annoying -- perhaps even infuriating			2
for a team of @entity8 scientists , this stubborn maneuver could change the face of search - and - rescue missions forever			1
introducing @entity11 -- a spherical flying robot encased in a flexible cage , which allows it to happily smash into surfaces while navigating disaster sites			1
bounce back unlike other rescue robots , where colliding with obstacles could easily spell the end of an expedition , @entity11 is able to bounce back without losing its bearings or damaging its in - built camera			1
the futuristic floating ball is the brainchild of scientists at the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , and it 's hoped that one day it will be used for everything from searching for survivors to measuring gas leaks in collapsed buildings			2
watch : flying robots perform amazing acrobatics " we were wondering why insects were so capable of going inside any building -- yet had limited senses such as eyesight , " explained co-creator @entity33			2
" one capability that was completely overlooked was their ability to collide into surfaces			2
for insects this is n't a big deal -- but it is for robots			0
" flying to the rescue indeed , one of the first major search - and - rescue missions to use robots was in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks on @entity55 's @entity54 -- an area deemed too dangerous or inaccessible to humans			1
however , the ground - dwelling machines sometimes found it difficult to negotiate the collapsed @entity54 , becoming stuck in the rubble			2
in the last decade , robotics has come a long way , with scientists increasingly looking at the benefits of flying machines in disaster zones			1
watch : flying robots inspired by birds " a ground robot will very quickly be limited -- even a staircase is difficult			1
if you need to reach people on the fifth floor of a building , it wo n't be able to do it , " said @entity33			0
" @entity77 allows you to overcome large obstacles			0
and it provides an elevated point of view -- it 's very useful to have an image of the scene from eye level , than from the floor			0
" clever design so how does @entity87 work ? with a 37 centimeter diameter , the robot is a little larger than a basketball			2
featuring a stable inner frame , and a rotating outer frame made of 90 flexible carbon rods , it is able to bounce off surfaces without damaging the machine			1
while other robots might need heavy sensors to help avoid collisions , @entity11 keeps things light , weighing just 370 grams			1
two propellers help it fly along at 5 kilometers per hour , with enough battery power to last five minutes			0
it can either be remote controlled , or fly autonomously , sending back footage to operators			0
@entity33 now hopes the pioneering design will be used in real lifesaving missions within the next year , and said we were on the brink of a new era in technology where drones were used in everyday life			0
" up until now , the military had all the drones out there , but in the last few years there 's been a huge development in civilian use , " he said			0
" technology is developing really fast in the field of remote control -- drones are used in rescue missions , fire , or inspecting unstable buildings , bridges , and boats			1
" @entity130 future the research team recently took @entity11 for a spin in a @entity8 woodland , watching it smash into trees , roll along uneven ground , and negotiate branches -- all without damaging its inner workings			1
it appeared like a rogue alien aircraft that had been left behind on a mission to @entity142			0
so what is it about flying robots that continues to capture our imaginations in a way few other pieces of tech can ? " it 's not limited to @entity152 -- that 's what fascinates people , this freedom to move in the third dimension , " said @entity33			0
" and seeing your creation flying is extremely satisfying			0

introducing @entity11 , the flying robot that moves like a fly
the machine features a *protective* cage that lets it bounce off surfaces
*includes* a small in - built camera
@entity8 scientists hope it will be used in search and rescue missions in the future
