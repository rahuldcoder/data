-- composer @entity1 comes from a long line of atheists			1
so he was n't looking to beat anyone over the head with " @entity6 " -- his latest score , for the breakaway hit on the @entity9			1
@entity10 is known for , among other things , his signature " @entity18 " -- an ominous bass drone cue associated with the " @entity17 " trailer -- well known in the movie business for punctuating almost every major action movie in the last few years			1
" it 's over every trailer ! " @entity10 laughed when talking to @entity0			1
" it 's funny how that sort of thing becomes part of the zeitgeist			2
but i suppose that 's exactly what trailers are looking for : something iconic , lasts less than a second , and shakes the seats in the theater			2
we 've seemed to unleash some sort of genie			2
" on this new project however , @entity10 said he wanted to stay away from anything so obvious			1
@entity10 and his composing partner @entity40 also wanted to stay away from anything that might feel rooted in a specific time period , eschewing the classical music references that had informed many of his previous scores			1
" if you listen to @entity47 , if you listen to @entity48 , if you listen to @entity49 , if you listen to anybody else -- bach for that matter -- who has dealt with religious music , there 's always a reflection of the style of their time , " @entity10 said			1
" and in a funny way , ' @entity6 ' is supposed to be a reflection of how we in our time relate to this material			1
we felt like if we could figure out a sound that was sort of timeless , and sort of absent of whatever is fashionable at the moment , that would be a good start			1
" because the scope of the " @entity6 " was so huge , with stories that span thousands of years , " 10 hours is not that long to tell a monumental story like this			1
" so while it was n't long enough on the one hand to tell the stories ( which , despite not being religious himself , he deemed " powerful " with a " great meaning of morality " ) , it was still longer than most of his projects			2
to get a handle on it , he decided thinking smaller was the way to go			2
" rather than look at the daunting enormity of it , you find some inspiration in some little corner of the movie , just so you get a foothold , " he said			2
for additional inspiration , @entity10 turned once again to @entity93 's @entity92 , who added her haunting vocals to the @entity96 - winning " @entity97 " score			1
@entity10 mentioned @entity92 to producers @entity98 and @entity100 who were very supportive of the idea			1
at first , @entity10 said , @entity92 said she was really busy , " but as soon as i said , ' would you like to work on ' @entity6 ' with @entity98 and @entity103 ? ' it was as if none of the other stuff mattered			1
she was instantly on board			0
this was something she 's always wanted to do			0
" with the shoot taking place in @entity114 , and production offices based in @entity116 , the in - between point for the group became @entity119			0
" @entity40 , @entity92 , @entity98 , @entity103 , and myself , whenever anyone found a moment , we could meet up in @entity119 and throw out ideas , " @entity10 said			1
" it was like a band			0
" the process was loose and unstructured -- " very different from how i work on a movie normally , " @entity10 said			1
a lot of improvisation was involved , as the composers moved through different textures to find " some sort of specificity			0
" " what the music is trying to do is maintain the idea that throughout these 10 hours , you get to feel something , " he said			2
" we 're not telling you what to feel			0
we 're just inviting you in			0
the music is trying to open doors			2
" and open doors , it did			0
" to @entity98 and @entity103 's credit , they did n't care if this was going to be a success or not , " @entity10 said			1
" when we started , there was no money and no belief in the project , other than our own			0
their enthusiasm carried the day			0
they just wanted to do this , and they were just going to do it , which is the right reason to do a project			0
" " the ones where you say , ' i need to do this			0
i ca n't sleep if i do n't do this			0
i ca n't do anything else , ' those are the ones with the most chance of being successful			0
i love working with people who do n't care about the money , who do n't care about the danger of failing , who just go for it			0
that 's what made me do it			0
fearless people are the best to hang around with			0
