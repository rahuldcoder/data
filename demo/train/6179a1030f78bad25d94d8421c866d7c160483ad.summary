-- as someone who has often worked from home during her career , i 've been obsessed with the firestorm @entity7 ceo @entity6 ignited earlier this month by demanding that her telecommuting employees get themselves to a bricks - and - mortar office — and soon			1
predictably , the blogosphere , tv news shows and critics everywhere blew up			0
how dare @entity13 snatch this benefit out from under @entity7 's virtual workers ? and how dare she prompt more progressively minded employers to consider doing the same to theirs ? talk about negative trendsetting			1
last week , @entity21 's much - heralded " @entity20 " for nonstore employees got downgraded , too			1
most of the commentary around @entity7 's decision has looked at how telecommuting cutbacks affect working parents — and in particular , working moms , like @entity13 herself			1
i agree that 's huge			1
but what has fascinated me about this telework debate is how almost no one has specifically addressed its impact on those of us without children			0
why should n't all of us , whether we parent children or not , have access to civilized ways of working that simplify our lives , decrease our commutes , allow us to be more efficient and maintain our sanity at the same time ? or do we have to have kids at home in order to have a valid " excuse " to benefit from the 21st century reality of virtual work ? @entity7 work - from - home policy riles workers everywhere hear me out			1
throughout my career , my single and child - free status have certainly benefited my employers and freelance clients , as i was able — and willing — to pick up and move to the other side of the country for long - term work assignments			1
even when living and working in @entity63 last year , i could take on last - minute writing projects that demanded " all - nighters , " as there was no spouse or youngster requiring attention			1
the fact that i have " neither chick nor child , " as one of my @entity75 colleagues used to say , allowed me the flexibility of traveling on short notice			1
these were all choices i happily made			0
so , if being unattached made me an asset to those i 've worked for , should that same status keep me , and millions of others without children , from enjoying flexible work arrangements that few seem to question if you 've got children at home ? gallery : brilliant women in @entity91 , then and now telecommuting works " because the benefits are so comprehensive			1
it 's not just supporting family balance , but you balance , " says @entity94 , general manager of @entity95			1
" it is n't just a perk for one demographic			2
" her group is the force behind last week 's " @entity104 2013			2
" sponsored by tech heavyweights @entity107 and @entity108 , it was the third annual global effort to encourage employees and employers to pledge to telework anytime between march 4 and 8			0
last year 's @entity104 generated more than 71,000 pledges , helping these folks gain back nearly 251,800 hours into their days and saving $ 5.6 million in commuting costs , according to @entity95			2
2013 's @entity104 pledge numbers have almost doubled			2
a " 2012 @entity119 " conducted by the @entity120 and the @entity121 found that 63 % of employers allow workers to work at home at least occasionally , up from 34 % in 2005			1
although telecommuting should benefit all job - eligible employees , often " working moms and parents tend to get more of a consideration , " admits @entity122 , the @entity120 's vice president of @entity124			1
" yet , we tell organizations employees should n't have to tell you a reason " why they 'd like to telecommute			2
" we advocate that you should be managing by results , not ' butts in seats			0
' " opinion : what @entity13 misses on work - life balance in other words , an employee 's family situation — or lack of one — should n't determine whether they 're able to telecommute			1
" one , you 've got to get your work done and have the conversation with your manager			2
it 's got to work for both the employer and the employee , " says @entity122 , who 's also the co-leader of the @entity120 's @entity151 initiative and holds a doctorate in business and organization management			1
" that 's what inclusion is all about , and why more and more chief diversity officers like me are on the bandwagon for this			2
you 're not going to be able to engage and retain great talent without having flexibility			2
but this is not just about telecommuting			2
it 's about compressed workweeks , part - time job options , flexible schedules			1
sometimes it might be job sharing			0
" @entity176 , 46 , is an independent clinical research consultant who has been home - based since 2007			2
single , she 's got four college - age kids living away from home			1
" i 've often thought about taking a job where i have to commute and work in an office , and there 's no way i 'd do that , " says @entity176 , who lives in @entity182 and worked virtually even when her children were in the house			1
" i 'm able to cut costs because i 'm not having to fill up my gas tank every week			0
and because i 'm self - employed , i 'm able to itemize many of my home office expenses			2
if you need to run an errand , you can do that , as long as you 're meeting your deadlines			0
" who works from home and how they do it working in an office , adds @entity95 's @entity94 , means " dry cleaning costs , going out to lunch			1
with all the work clothes you have to buy , you could put money away and invest it in your 401 ( k ) so you can retire at a reasonable age			0
it is about money ; it 's about time			0
" in theory , we can find ways to earn more cash			0
but the great equalizer is the clock			0
none of us , whether we 're billionaires or flat broke , gets more than 24 hours each day			0
the quality of life aspect is huge to women like @entity222 , a married but childless 34 - year - old @entity223 editor for @entity224 , a lifestyle website for women			0
" i 'm willing to work for a little bit less because my lifestyle is so much better , " the recently married @entity222 says about her full - time virtual work			0
" i usually wear workout clothes all day every day , which i absolutely love			0
when i 'm waiting for someone to get back to me or for edits on a story i 've written , i try to fit in a workout			0
i save money on food because i eat at home — and healthier , too			0
especially if you 're single or do n't have kids , " when you 're balancing work and your life , work always seems to trump you , " says @entity94			1
" this is a way to bring life back to the front burner			0
" she says 85 % of the companies on @entity250 's 2012 " @entity248 " list offer some sort of telework option			1
that 's surely no coincidence			0
i 'd never want to keep my colleagues with children from making work arrangements that best add balance to their hectic lives			0
let 's just hope that the choices we kid - free professionals make are viewed as equally valid and real			0

do you agree that parents have garnered a disproportionate share of the conversation around working from home lately ? let us know in the comments section .			1

the outcry around @entity7 's new telecommuting policy has centered on parents
@entity266 argues that you do n't have to be a parent to demand better work options
just as a *nonparent* may offer more scheduling flexibility , that worker can demand *reciprocity*
working from home can offer health benefits as well as others , says one teleworker
