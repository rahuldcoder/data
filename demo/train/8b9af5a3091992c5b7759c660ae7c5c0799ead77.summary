nevertheless , retailers were reporting a sharp rise in sales of @entity5 items in the immediate wake of his death			2
a spokeswoman for the upscale @entity103 department store told @entity2 it had seen a 14-fold increase in @entity5 brand sales , with top sellers including his signature skull print scarf and main line collection			2

this is a big loss for the world			0
" the designer was born as @entity5 in 1970 in @entity0 's @entity189 , the son of a taxi driver			1
he left school with few qualifications , but later studied fashion at @entity0 's prestigious @entity195 and worked on the famous @entity197 street of tailors at a company that made suits for @entity201			2
