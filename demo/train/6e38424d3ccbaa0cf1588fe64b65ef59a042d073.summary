-- are @entity2 sports fans the toughest in the world ? they would certainly give the @entity5 football press a run for their money			1
they do n't like you if you 're too good			2
but they ca n't abide if you 're rubbish either			2
admittedly i have only been in the country for five days			1
and with an office full of @entity2 cameraman , i 'm more than aware that i 'm putting myself in line for some thoroughly unflattering camera angles in the days to come			1
but this is what i have learned			2
take " @entity20 " for starters			2
it 's a new phrase i 've discovered			1
the urban dictionary says it 's @entity2 slang to criticize highly successful people and cut them down to size			1
i was taught it by virtually the only fan supporting @entity27 in the @entity30 women 's final at the @entity31 on saturday night			1
it was her explanation for the icy reception the @entity34 received			2
yes , @entity35 had upset a few people with her medical time out in her semi			1
but she 'd fronted up to all the questions she was asked , and admitted she 'd made a mistake			0
and @entity41 said it had n't bothered her two hoots			0
here she was fighting her heart out to stay as the world @entity45 and defend her grand slam title -- at just 23 years of age			1
if the crowd had stopped booing for long enough , they might have seen she played some frankly brilliant tennis			1
what happened to marveling at excellence ? homegrown talent does n't fare much better , though			0
he 's still some way from a grand slam title , but 20 - year - old @entity57 got further than any other @entity2 player at the opening grand slam of the year			1
he beat eventual winner and world no. 1 @entity62 just a couple of weeks ago as well			1
but my taxi driver on thursday told me he was rubbish			0
cast your mind back too , to the early days of @entity69 's swimming career , and the pressures he faced at just 15 , after becoming the youngest male world champion			1
but if you ca n't win by winning , you 'd think they back the underdog			0
but no , that does n't always seem to be the case either			0
@entity2 rugby fan @entity78 on sports website @entity76 gives us a list of things he 'd rather do instead of watching the @entity82 get beaten by the @entity83 -- again			1
it includes vacuuming , and washing the car			0
i 'm a woman , and i 'll take the sport every time			1
why not throw a party , sing your heart out and marvel in plucky failure once again			0
the @entity92 have been doing it for years			0
take @entity94 -- the first @entity96 ski - jumper at the @entity97			1
in 1988 he became a national hero -- as a loser			0
it 's not just @entity2 though			1
@entity102 and @entity103 have some of the most passionate , positive football supporters in the world			1
until their teams lose two or three games			0
then watch the tide turn			0
but i suppose at least they care			0
i found a trip to the basketball in @entity114 to be one of the strangest sporting experiences of my life			0
it was the heat against the @entity119 in early 2007			0
quite a big game at the time			0
but you would n't have known it inside the @entity123			0
fans turned up as and when they liked , or popped their heads in for a quarter , and then headed back to the popcorn stand			2
they 've definitely got passion here			0
i saw that up close and personal as a few hundred @entity132 fans arrived in @entity133 to see their team take on @entity136			2
you could hear their songs from half a mile away as they approached the ground			0
and i have to say , @entity141 told me he 's loving the fans here			1
he joked that he 's being asked for about a thousand autographs a day since his move from @entity144 to the @entity145			2
but he does n't mind because he 's being asked nicely			2
i 'll give them that			0
the thing about @entity2 is that on the whole , it loves sport			1
they have a lot of it here			0
not just the @entity30 tennis , but cricket , @entity156 's @entity2 @entity155 , horse racing 's @entity157 , @entity159 , rugby league , and soccer 's @entity145			1
what i do n't understand is that there 's so much to celebrate			2
but maybe when you have a horse like @entity169 , human endeavor is just never going to be good enough			0
@entity170 is no reflection of the welcome i 've had during my time in @entity2 ! i 've had a truly wonderful visit -- and very much look forward to coming back soon !			1
