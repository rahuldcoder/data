" it is an honor for us to join in your memories , to recall and to reflect , and above all to reaffirm the true spirit of 9/11 : love , compassion , sacrifice and to enshrine it forever in the heart of our nation , " the president said before the gray bedrock of the fallen towers			1
both chilling and somber , the memorial will take visitors back to the day the twin towers of the @entity33 were felled by hijacked jet planes on a clear september morning nearly 13 years ago			1
it also remembers those who lost their lives outside of @entity0 the same day , when a hijacked jet flew into the @entity39 and another went down in a field in @entity41			2
" here we tell their story so that generations yet unborn will never forget , " @entity2 said			1
" of coworkers who led others to safety , of passengers who stormed the cockpit , our men and women in uniform who rushed into an inferno , our first responders who charged up those stairs , a generation of service members , our 9/11 generation who have served with honor in more than a decade of war			0
" the sacrifices of that day and the toil to build the museum demonstrates that the @entity13 is " a nation that stands tall and united and unafraid because no act of terror can match the strength or the character of our country , " the president said			1
" nothing can ever break us , " he added			0
" nothing can change who we are as @entity13			0

before his speech , the president and first lady @entity87 viewed the museum with former president @entity90 and former secretary of state @entity91 , along with others			1
@entity2 said the museum , which includes a mangled firetruck and a memorial wall with photos of the victims , provided a " profound and moving experience			1
" speakers recounted stories of random acts of kindness and courage that marked the fateful day , of firefighters who died climbing up stairs to save lives , of 24 - year - old @entity107 -- who emerged from the smoke wearing a red bandana and calmly led survivors to the stairs in one of the towers			1
" they did n't know his name , " @entity2 said			1
" they did n't know where he came from but they knew their lives had been saved by the man in the red bandana			0
" @entity107 led survivors to safety during the chaos of the terrorist attack , before going back up the stairs to save others and losing his life			2
one of his red bandanas is on display in the museum			2
" all those who come here will have a chance to know the sacrifice of a young man , who like so many , gave his life so others might live , " @entity2 said			2
@entity107 's mother , @entity138 , said the memorial was a symbol of " how people helped each other that day " and she hoped it would inspire others " to do the same in ways both big and small			2
