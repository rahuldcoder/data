@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed a two - month extension of the payroll tax cut friday , ending what had been a heated political stalemate and sealing a hard - fought win for @entity8 on an issue -- taxes -- that has historically favored the @entity12			1
earlier in the day , the measure cleared the @entity15 - controlled @entity14 and the @entity12 - controlled @entity16 by unanimous consent , a procedural move allowing the measure to pass even though most members of @entity21 were already home for the holidays			1
" this is some good news just in the nick of time , " @entity2 said shortly before departing the @entity24 for @entity25			0
but " we have a lot more work to do			0
this continues to be a make - or - break moment for the middle class in this country			0
" among other things , the $ 33 billion bill also includes a two - month extension of emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so - called " doc fix , " a delay in scheduled payment reductions to doctors who treat @entity43 patients			1
@entity21 will consider a longer extension of all three measures when it reconvenes in january			0
@entity2 also signed a separate appropriations bill funding the government through september 2012 , wrapping up a legislative year marked by repeated partisan brinksmanship and declining public approval of a seemingly dysfunctional @entity21			0
political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday extension has eroded @entity12 strength on the party 's core issue of lower taxes			2
while @entity12 leaders first questioned the merit of the tax holiday and then complained that a short - term extension would be more trouble than it 's worth , @entity2 used the standoff to portray the @entity63 as defenders of the rich with a callous attitude toward the burdens of the middle class			1
the episode also called into question speaker @entity71 's control over the @entity16 @entity12 caucus			1
the speaker , according to multiple accounts , initially favored the two - month extension , which had passed the @entity14 with an overwhelming bipartisan majority			1
he was then apparently forced to retreat from that position last weekend in the face of a tea party - fueled revolt in which freshman conservatives in particular demanded an immediate 12 - month extension			2
in a virtual party - line vote , the @entity24 on tuesday passed a measure calling for the creation of a @entity16 - @entity14 conference committee to consider ways to pay for an immediate year - long continuation			1
but congressional @entity8 and administration officials , noting previous legislative maneuvering over the issue and a looming december 31 deadline , called the @entity16 's terms unrealistic and refused to budge			0
@entity63 were also enraged by the actions of their @entity16 counterparts , believing that @entity16 @entity12 leaders had backed out of a deal to support the temporary two - month plan			1
senate minority leader @entity98 , @entity99 , was among those who ultimately called for @entity101 to relent			0
facing rising @entity12 establishment fears that the @entity12 was squandering its political advantage on taxes , the speaker again reversed himself on thursday , this time essentially consenting to the @entity14 's terms			2
according to @entity12 sources , @entity71 held a conference call thursday afternoon with his fellow @entity101 in which the speaker refused to allow any members to ask questions or raise objections			1
one @entity12 @entity16 member on the call described the speaker as " tired and ticked off			2
" @entity71 , in announcing the deal to reporters later in the day , insisted the @entity16 @entity12 's prior opposition to the @entity14 plan was the right thing to do , even if it turned out to be politically questionable			1
" it may not have been politically the smartest thing in the world , " the @entity122 @entity12 conceded , but the end result was " we were able to fix what came out of the @entity14			2
" @entity71 also acknowledged the pressure he was under , saying : " i talked to enough members over the last 24 hours who say we do n't like the two - month extension and if you can get this fixed , why not do the right thing for the @entity134 people even if it 's not exactly what we want			1
" the final bill is virtually same @entity14 proposal @entity101 rejected earlier this week			0
@entity16 @entity12 were given slim political cover through the addition of legislative language designed to ease the administrative burden on small businesses implementing the plan , as well as a commitment to continue negotiations on a one - year extension of the tax cut and other benefits			1
under the deal , the payroll tax will remain at the current 4.2 % rate instead of reverting to the 6.2 % rate it was at before the cut enacted last year			2
without congressional action , the higher rate would have returned in 2012 , meaning an average $ 1,000 tax increase for 160 million @entity134			0
the typical worker 's take home salary would have been reduced by about $ 40 per pay period without the tax cut			2
analysts said @entity71 had little choice but to back down			0
" it became increasingly obvious he had to fold , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity164 , using poker terminology			0
@entity71 was under " intense pressure from senior @entity12 " over a situation that " became so botched , " he said			2
@entity169 , the vice president and director of governance studies at the @entity171 , said the issue has worked in the favor of @entity8 because they had @entity12 " seemingly willing to accept a tax increase " by opposing the @entity14 extension of the payroll tax cut			1
the conservative @entity179 , in an editorial earlier this week , warned that @entity16 @entity12 had lost the political advantage of advocating tax cuts to @entity2 and the @entity8			1
some tea party @entity12 , however , are now livid that @entity71 backed down			2
" @entity16 has caved yet again to the president and @entity8 , " freshman rep. @entity183 , @entity184 , said in a written statement			0
" we were sent here with a clear set of instructions from the @entity134 people to put an end to business as usual in @entity0 , yet here we are being asked to sign off on yet another gimmick			0
no wonder the @entity134 people are left with a bad taste in their mouths when it comes to @entity21			0
" asked about @entity71 's performance , @entity183 later told @entity1 he was " disappointed in our entire leadership team			1
" while the congressman told @entity201 he did n't anticipate a conservative revolt against @entity71 , he did expect " a lot of discussion " about what the @entity12 stands for			0
a number of @entity12 have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by @entity2 -- as part of the larger tax cut package -- to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed @entity214 oil pipeline from @entity215 to the @entity216			1
republicans and some @entity15 union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs ; critics question its environmental impact			0
@entity1 's @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report			0
