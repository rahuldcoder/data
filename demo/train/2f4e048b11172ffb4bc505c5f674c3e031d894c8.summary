-- it was a difficult choice : the apple pie or the @entity4 - style cheesecake ? both sat in front of me , looking succulent on separate plates , on the counter at @entity10 in @entity11			1
i pushed my coffee aside to study this opportunity			0
we were in the middle of filming a report about @entity17 , an @entity19 expat in @entity11 whom you might call an unusual entrepreneur			1
in the midst of @entity26 's economic crisis , he opened a shop two years ago to make and sell @entity19 - style pies and cakes			1
unusual because he 's an octogenarian			0
he says he still plays tennis			0
he certainly still drives because i took a ride in his car from the shop to his office , where i met his large parrot			0
" i said , ' why do n't i go after that making apple pies and cherry pies and things like that			0
of course i really did n't know anything about how to do it , ' " @entity42 said			2

he built a successful engineering firm over decades , with projects for the nuclear power and automotive industries , among others			0
his oldest son now runs @entity10 from a sleek office in central @entity11 , which also serves as the pie firm 's administrative hub			1
the company is nearly making a profit , even as 200,000 small businesses have closed in the crisis			1
@entity17 is n't the typical young entrepreneur the @entity26 government aims to help with a new law to make it easier to open a business			2

his key hire seems to be a veteran pastry chef who formerly worked at an @entity19 - style pie shop in @entity11 that closed years ago			1

" " of course , in a moment when things are like this , " @entity42 added , " even restaurants are wanting to offer something that will attract the attention of their clients and our products do			2
" sixty five percent of the desserts are sold and delivered to upscale restaurants and hotels			0
@entity42 personally convinced each of these big clients , and we went along for the pastry delivery to the @entity117 on @entity11 's main boulevard			1
" we improve our buffet with the pies , " said @entity119 , food and beverage manager at the hotel , " because the @entity19 guests try to find @entity19 products in @entity26			2
" his shop , in northern @entity11 , is decorated with images of @entity130 icons like @entity131 and @entity132 , along with bright red restaurant stools and other furniture made in @entity135 , @entity136 , where @entity42 was born			1
@entity17 plans more expansion , even while he 's worried about his own waistline			2
" i should be fatter because i taste and eat a lot of pies and cakes , " @entity42 said			2
which brings us back to my choice			0
clearly , i would n't be able to have an objective opinion about the apple pie or the cheese cake unless i tried them			0
so for the sake of the story , i dug in			0
and it persuaded me that @entity19 - style desserts can come out quite well , even when prepared far from their normal settings			1
@entity42 politely interrupted our conversation to take another call on his mobile phone			0
he says he 's just lined up 10 more hotels to take his pies			0
despite the economic crisis , his phone keeps ringing .			0
