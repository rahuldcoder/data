-- what will we see in 2013 ? one thing for sure : the year will begin with chief justice @entity4 and president @entity5 getting two chances to recite the oath correctly			2
after that , here are my guesses			0
same - sex marriage and the @entity13			1
there are two cases , and there are a @entity17 - worth of possibilities for their outcomes			2
on one extreme , the court could say that the federal government ( in the @entity22 ) and the states can ban or allow same - sex marriage as they prefer			1
on the other end , the @entity13 could rule that gay people have a constitutional right to marry in any state in the union			1
( or somewhere in between			0
the future of affirmative action			1
in a case pending before the @entity13 , the @entity13 could outlaw all affirmative action in admissions at public universities , with major implications for all racial preferences in all school or non-school settings			1
gun control returns to the agenda			1
the @entity41 ( and probably some states ) will wrestle with the question of gun control , an issue that had largely fallen off the national agenda before the massacre in @entity48			1
expect many invocations ( some accurate , some not ) of the @entity50			0
the continued decline of the death penalty			0
death sentences and executions continue to decline , and this trend will continue			0
fear of mistaken executions ( largely caused by @entity59 exonerations ) and the huge cost of the death penalty process will both accelerate the shift			0
there will be outrage , shock and amusement			0
( celebrity to be identified later			0
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity72 .			2

@entity72 : 2013 will see *pivotal* *decisions* in several *key* areas of law
he says @entity13 could decide fate of same - sex marriage
affirmative action for public *college* admissions is also on @entity13 *'s* agenda
@entity72 : *newtown* massacre put gun control *debate* back in the *forefront*
