-- late last month in @entity1 , @entity2 , civilians who have cell phone subscriptions received a foreboding text message in @entity6 : " game over			1
" those on prepaid phones -- including many opposition fighters and activists , who tend to throw their devices away after several uses to avoid detection -- did not receive the text , or subsequent messages , signed by the @entity17 , telling them to surrender their weapons			1
" the government was sending a message to the rebels through people who subscribe , " says @entity21 , a @entity23 - based @entity22 affairs analyst -- an act of psychological warfare carried out by cell phone			2
the texts have increased @entity2 watchers ' concerns that the embattled government has realized both the full potential of using the @entity36 and mobile carriers to communicate with its leaderless opposition , and the importance of the networks as domestic and international lifelines for the rebels			1
defecting @entity2 propagandist says his job was ' to fabricate ' there are growing fears that the regime could shut down the internet across the country , similar to what was done in @entity52 during its january 2011 uprising , which brought communication in @entity55 to a near standstill			1
" there have been enough rumors that the more tech - savvy folks are expecting it , " says @entity57 , director for international freedom of expression for the @entity60 , which works to defend digital rights			1
" in @entity52 , you could say no one would have expected that			1
" last month , the network was down for 10 days in @entity1 , the current focal point of the fighting , with activists and rebels communicating largely by satellite phone until service was restored september 20			1
@entity76 : why @entity2 turmoil threatens @entity78 but perhaps the biggest red flag came in july , when the government - controlled @entity80 shut down 61 of its 66 networks , effectively cutting off the country 's internet for about 40 minutes			1
since the summer , smaller , infrequently reported outages have plagued @entity86 , @entity1 and other hard - hit cities			2
" since it 's state telecom that provides access , it 's safe to say the government could turn the internet off at any point , " says @entity88 , senior analyst at @entity89 , a firm which tracks @entity36 data and intelligence and has been monitoring the situation in @entity2			1
" the outages we 've seen in the last couple of months appear to be because of physical damage from fighting , or from power outages			0
they 're short - lived , they flicker on and off			2
we 've seen some @entity36 being ( purposely ) disabled in more disruptive parts of the country , like @entity1			0
" two weeks ago , rebels angry with the government 's mass text intensified their attacks against forces loyal to president @entity113			0
the escalation resulted in the partial destruction of @entity1 's storied covered souk , a heritage site since its days as a @entity119 trading post			0
it also triggered an increase in violence in the decimated city , where rebels tuesday continued to advance with the seizing of @entity125 , a key strategic town on the road between @entity1 and @entity86			0
" in a military zone , like @entity1 has become , the government can still communicate but opposition forces will have a very hard time " should the network crash again , @entity21 says			1
" i think it 'll happen in a case of desperation			0
i would n't be surprised if for some reason they took down a few towers in @entity1			0
" who is arming the @entity2 conflict ? the @entity2 internet market is a state monopoly			1
unlike neighboring @entity144 , whose 3 million citizens have access to 900 internet routes out of the country , @entity2 's 30 million people only have 66			1
" it 's a country with state control over the @entity36 , " @entity88 says			2
" there 's no free market			2
" @entity154 , a @entity2 scholar and activist , believes it 's in @entity113 's best interest to keep the networks running			1
" they 're interested in measuring and assessing what 's happening and trying to listen in , and even penetrate , and spy on activists and collect information , " he says			2
and the regime has a history of discounting the global influence of activist bloggers			0
" they do n't think ( the opposition ) has the ear of the international media anyway , " @entity88 says			0
" so they want their supporters to be able to voice any opinion that 's ( pro-regime )			0
and they 'll want to allow their supporters to use the @entity36 to voice those opinions			0
" it 's the only reason why they have n't taken it down			0
" but just in case , activists are prepared			0
" the standard government - controlled networks are not the only way of communication -- there are also satellite phones and internet connection and landline phones , " @entity182 says			1
" so it would be a setback , but it 's not going to cut off communications if people are prepared for it			0
" " much of the opposition rely on satellite phones more than anything else , " @entity154 adds			1
during @entity1 's 10 - day blackout , " activists there were still able to upload videos and the like			2
" it 's hard to predict twists and turns in @entity1 , where there is general lawlessness			0
" some groups under the @entity210 are actually doing a lot of bandit - like action , looting government buildings , and for them it 's justified , " @entity154 says			0
" activists inside are angry about this , because they want to preserve the state and all its establishments while they try to remove the regime			2
" children in a war - torn @entity2 town hold school in a cave			1

a @entity2 *shutdown* of the internet would be similar to what happened in @entity52 in 2011
internet freedom *advocate* : " the more tech - savvy folks are expecting it " in @entity2
the @entity2 internet market is a state - run monopoly
many opposition activists rely on satellite phones to communicate
