@entity2 's fingertips and toe tips barely cling on to the side of a mountain in @entity6 , thousands of feet in the air			1
he is free solo climbing , which means he has no rope to support him , so one false move would mean a long fall to the rocky ground below			1
he looks up at filmmaker @entity12 , who is capturing his climb in silence , and finally breaks the ice : " so what should i be doing ? do you want me to make it look like this is hard for me ? " watching 26 - year - old @entity2 climb , it seems impossible			1
@entity12 , also a climber , first discovered him in 2008 , and he was so amazed that he started turning his climbs into documentaries			1
as with the routes @entity2 scales , it has taken many small moves to get here			1
" he was a horrible kid to raise , from the day of his birth , and i mean that literally , " says his mother , @entity30			0
" he was always trying to get vertical			0
at 11 hours old , he would hold on to your pinkie and stand up on his little legs			0
" soon his mother would have to get used to him climbing on counters , refrigerators , bookshelves , and everything else			2
he found his outlet when he was about 10 years old and a climbing gym opened in @entity42 , @entity43 , where he lived			1
he found his passion and his home , hanging on walls			0
he started working at the gym when he got older			0
after hours , when the supervisors went home , he and his friends would try climbing without a rope , and that started a passion that has only grown in the 17 years since			1
extreme kayaker helps young adults with cancer through outdoor adventures " it was exciting			0
it was also kind of scary , but i really liked it , " @entity2 remembers			1
@entity2 graduated high school and took the next logical step for a smart kid , to the @entity65			1
but after his first year , he faced some difficult challenges			0
he was n't happy at school , did n't have many friends , and then in 2004 , his father passed away			0
around the same time he placed second at the @entity71 climbing competition , realized that was one of the few things that made him happy , and decided to chase his dream			2
" at first i did n't even have a car			0
i had a bicycle and a tent , and it was pretty grim , " he remembers			0
" but i just wanted to climb all the time , so that 's what i did			2
" his dedication paid off as his name started circulating in the climbing world and sponsors started calling			1
soon he was able to support his lifestyle and to attempt things that had never been done			0
this includes his most recent feat of climbing the " @entity91 " on his own in one day , about a 7,000 - foot course			2
@entity12 remembers when he first met @entity2 , " he was so self - confident and so calm			1
his vision of what was possible in climbing was , ' anything is possible			2
' i mean the first things he free - soloed , people thought it was a joke , it was n't even possible			0
" climbing friends gave him the nickname " @entity103 " because of his nonchalant attitude toward incredible feats			2
@entity2 climbs with a rope 90 % of the time , but every year , he 'll take on one or two epic challenges with no rope at all			1
@entity2 's demeanor is a clash of the uber - confidence you 'd expect of someone who would climb a 3,000 - foot wall with no rope vs. the modesty of an average climber			1
" i 'm one of the best soloists ... but only because there 's been like eight really good soloists ever , so it 's not that hard to be one of the best , " he claims			2
but many , including @entity12 , would disagree			1
" on the physical side , he 's an elite climber			2
in the mental game , @entity2 is inarguably the greatest in the history of the sport			1
his ability to be composed in the most extreme positions is beyond wherever anyone has gone or thought they could go			0
" watching him defy gravity raises the question : how long he can sustain this lifestyle ? he travels the country , sleeping in a van , and regularly tackles dangerous climbing destinations all over the world			1
but people close to him believe he 'll be around for the long haul			0
" he 's very , very calculated , and he has this ability to stay even - keeled when climbing			1
so i do n't think there 's a high probability that he will fall , " says @entity12			1
his mother agrees , " i 'm his mother , of course i worry about his safety			0
but i think he 's very in tune with what he 's capable of			2
" 2 @entity152 climbers found dead in @entity154 mountains now @entity2 faces his biggest challenge of all : fame			1
he 's become somewhat of a legend in the climbing world after documentaries like @entity12 's " @entity160 " have made the film circuit , and his 2011 appearance on " @entity163 " expanded his audience			1
the sudden exposure caused him to run away the same way he did college			0
" i kind of dealt with it by fleeing back into the van and embracing my old style of just being on the road , " he says			0
" but then i realized that wo n't fly			0
so i 've spent the last few months going the other direction , embracing all the craziness			0
hopefully channeling it to do something positive			0
" @entity2 is getting more comfortable in the spotlight			1
his list of sponsorships has expanded from @entity180 to include even a luxury watch line			0
his most recent climb is featured in another film to be released this year , and he 's appeared in a popular @entity185 commercial			2
he is now working on starting a nonprofit that will help the environment , a cause he cares about deeply			0
" hopefully i can translate all this into something that will have a more lasting effect on the world			2
he has a shot to be a recognizable character in a sport that has n't yet had its @entity196 , a crossover hit with the general public			2
" @entity199 can relate to him in a way that they ca n't relate to regular rope climbers			0
what he 's doing is overcoming a basic human fear			0
it 's not even about the sport ; anyone can imagine being on the side of a cliff face and being scared to death , " says @entity12			1
the future is wide open for @entity2 , and chances are , he 'll take small , calculated steps to reach the top			1
