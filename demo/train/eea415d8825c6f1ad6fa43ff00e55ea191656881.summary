-- " do i look like @entity1 ? like , come on			0
seriously ? " @entity3 understandably rankles at such a comparison with one of the world 's greatest tennis players			1
" you know , it 's kind of crazy , but it 's really not that bad			2
but when you hear it , it 's like , ' @entity15 , did they just say that ? ' " only the laziest of observers could mistake the 19 - year - old rising star for a @entity21 sister off the court			1
but on it , the similarities are striking			0
blessed with natural athleticism and steely determination allied to a powerful serve and forehand , @entity3 shares many of the attributes that have helped @entity30 and @entity1 dominate the women 's game over the past 15 years			1
posters of the sisters , who have won 21 grand slam singles titles between them , adorned @entity3 ' bedroom walls when she was growing up			1
obviously they 're like the coolest people			0
they are the greatest tennis players ever to me , " she told @entity2 's @entity42			2
@entity30 works really hard and is a great role model for girls , she says , while @entity1 has become a close friend			0
" we talk about everything ... anything that comes to mind			0
we always have good conversations and we have a lot of things to talk about			0
" 2012 has been a breakthrough year in @entity3 ' fledgling career			1
she reached the second round of the @entity57 in january before making her @entity59 debut for the @entity60 alongside @entity1 against @entity61 in april			2
promising performances followed at both @entity63 ( reaching the third round ) and at @entity65 , where she achieved her best grand slam result to date , losing to @entity69 champion @entity68 in the last 16			1
results away from the grand slams have also been encouraging , with semifinal appearances at @entity74 events in @entity75 in may and more recently in @entity76 all of which has helped earn @entity3 a top - 50 ranking heading into the @entity69 , where she meets @entity80 's @entity79 in the opening round on tuesday			1
the former @entity65 champion and two - time quarterfinalist at @entity84 beat @entity3 in @entity75 and will provide a stern examination of the young @entity60 's evolving game			1
" i 'm working on so many different things			0
coming to the net more , being more aggressive			0
i 'm really working on my concentration			0
that 's like a big one for me , " she said			2
@entity3 has got a great attitude , says her coach @entity93 , and does n't fear the big stage			1
" @entity3 is a phenomenal athlete and probably has one of the best forehands in the world			1
she has so many options when she plays			0
so it 's really about ( improving ) shot selection and channeling her power , " @entity93 says			2
" she 's a great personality			2
she speaks very well ... she 's fun to be around and she 's great for tennis			2
" @entity3 first picked up a racket when she was nine , catching the eye of coach and former men 's pro , @entity106 at the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110			1
on his advice , her mother @entity111 decided to relocate the family to @entity115 to further @entity3 ' ambitions , enlisting her at the @entity117 in @entity118			1
it was a smart move and provided the platform for a successful junior career which saw @entity3 claim three consecutive junior grand slam doubles titles in 2010 at @entity65 , @entity63 and @entity84 with @entity125 partner @entity124			1
it was also proof of her exceptional sporting genes -- her mother was a champion swimmer at @entity129 while her biological father , @entity130 , who tragically died in a car crash in 2009 , was a former @entity132 running back			1
@entity111 and @entity3 divorced when @entity3 was a child , and she saw little of her father while growing up			1
but his death , aged 43 , was a painful blow and followed the loss of her stepfather to cancer two years earlier			0
" when my dad died it was a really tough time , but my whole family has been super supportive			0
i 've come out a better person and i 've learned so much at a young age , " @entity3 said			1
it was her stepfather who got @entity3 hooked on tennis in the first place , @entity111 told @entity2			1
" he was very passionate about tennis			0
@entity3 was always watching him at the club before we moved to @entity115			2
the two of them really had a tennis bond , " @entity111 said			2
today , @entity111 , who also has a son , @entity155 , tries to keep things as normal as they can be for her daughter , treading the line between protector and liberator			1
" you know , sometimes i do n't travel because she really does need to feel the pressure on her own			0
but you keep your day - to - day routines the same and keep your family and your values the same and it works out pretty well , " she said			0
@entity3 ' maturity bodes well for her future , says @entity170 , former @entity60 no. 1 and winner of 10 titles on the men 's @entity173			1
she does n't appear to be in awe of anything , and that 's impressive at that age , " @entity170 said			0
" when i came on tour , i was definitely a little shook by playing @entity181 and @entity182 ... but she does n't seem like that and that 's impressive			2
it 's going to win her some matches later			0
" for now though , @entity3 is just looking forward to her home slam , where she reached the third round in her debut last year			1
" oh , it 's crazy			0
it 's just so many people and they all want you to win , " she said			0
" it 's so nice just to be on court where everyone is cheering for you			0
a home slam is always really special and this year will be just as amazing as all the other ones			0

@entity3 has enjoyed a successful year on the tour and is hotly tipped for success
the 19 - year - old will play @entity80 's @entity79 in the opening round of the @entity69
she is the daughter of former @entity132 player @entity130 and *ex-swimmer* @entity111
rising star looking to build on promising runs at @entity63 and the @entity65 earlier this year
