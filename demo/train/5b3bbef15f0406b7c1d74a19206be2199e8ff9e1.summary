@entity0 though it might seem , there are people who love inflight meals			2
stranger still , there are people who love inflight meals so much they want to eat them at home			1
that 's the premise behind a new venture that 's begun making deliveries of airline - style dinners to addresses in @entity16			1
" some of our customers called us and said we love to eat fresh food , but we do n't want to have convenience food , " says @entity17 of online produce retailer @entity19			1
to answer their call , in august the company teamed with @entity26 , the catering arm of @entity16 airline @entity28 to launch @entity29			1
still in an eight - week trial period that @entity32 describes as its " pre- pre-pilot stage , " the service currently makes once - weekly deliveries in @entity16 's @entity36 and @entity37 regions of meals inspired by @entity28 's business class menus			1
menus include steak filets , chicken in pepper sauce and fried cod and retail at about $ 13			2
there are also vegetarian options			0
@entity17 says the meals appeal to working parents with kids to feed and to busy business travelers who perhaps do n't want to go cold turkey after several days of tucking into delicious airplane food			1
menu testing @entity29 's meals are better than the inflight equivalent , he insists , because they 're delivered fresh for customers to heat up themselves instead of being precooked and packed into the metal crates used by commercial aviation caterers			1
there 's also the advantage of being able to eat them with real metal cutlery and -- depending on the customer 's domestic setup -- without being repeatedly jostled by the person in the next seat			0
" they 're astonishingly ok , " says @entity17			1
" i did n't think one could do such stuff that you heat and eat it , but it works			0
" it 's not as good as if you cook yourself -- unless you ca n't cook properly -- but it 's ok			0
" the pilot service appears to be going well so far , he adds , but it 's still too early to tell if it 'll be rolled out further afield			0
" if it will be successful we will of course expand , if it 's not , we wo n't			0
there 's a lot of things we have to test , not just if the meals are liked by the customers , but also the logistics			2
" so for the time being , the rest of us will have to suffer the inconvenience of long - haul travel if we 're hungry for inflight flavors			0
or we could just settle for a sandwich			0
would you eat airline food at home ? let us know in the comments below .			2
