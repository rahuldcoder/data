-- a decade ago , @entity3 's @entity2 government was badly divided over whether to join the @entity4			1
the prime minister strongly supported the idea , as did much of the @entity3 business community and many leading media voices			2
one of the proponents ' most effective tactics was to ridicule opponents as cranky and xenophobic -- even borderline racist			2
here for example is a correspondent for the @entity15 deriding some of them , members of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , back , in 2004			2
" in the pub i encounter @entity20 , an @entity22 @entity21			2
' i want out of @entity23 , ' he says			2
' @entity23 is a disease			2
' " that 's hardly an argument to take seriously			1
only ... the @entity4 opponents were totally right			2
right for the wrong reasons , but still right			2
it 's human nature to assess difficult questions , not on the merits , but on our feelings about the different " teams " that form around different answers			1
to cite a painful personal experience : during the decision - making about the @entity42 war , i was powerfully swayed by the fact that the proposed invasion of @entity42 was supported by those who had been most right about the @entity46 -- and was most bitterly opposed by those who had been wrongest about the @entity46			2
yet in the end , it is not teams that matter			2
as queen @entity54 's first prime minister bitterly quipped after a policy fiasco : " what wise men had promised has not happened			1
what the damned fools predicted has actually come to pass			2
" which brings us to the uproar over the @entity65 's study of the fiscal effects of immigration -- and the revelation that one of the study 's coauthors wrote a ph.d. dissertation asserting large and enduring differences in intelligence between different ethnic and racial groups			1
heritage is a powerful conservative think tank in @entity77 , very influential on @entity78			2
on may 6 , @entity76 released a study of the likely budget effects of the @entity82 plan to open a " pathway to citizenship " for the 10 + million people who live in the @entity84 in violation of the nation 's immigration laws			1
the study found that the plan would add $ 6.3 trillion to the nation 's budget deficits over the next 50 years			1
that conclusion ignited a huge controversy			0
still , even the fiercest critics had to concede the basic validity of @entity76 's claim			1
in the words of @entity99 , formerly director of the @entity100 under president @entity101 and an ardent supporter of the " pathway to citizenship " : " i expect making 8 - 9 million people here illegally into @entity84 citizens would increase future deficits once these people are eligible for benefits			0
" the pathway to citizenship will add to deficits because of these basic demographic facts about the illegal population : it is very large and it is very low - skilled			1
as is , the immigrant population in the @entity84 earns less and depends more on government benefits than the native - born population			0
as formerly illegal residents gain access to more benefits , that dependency can only rise			0
perhaps the ultimate cost of legalization will be less than @entity76 estimated : $ 4 trillion , say			1
conceivably , the cost could be even higher			1
but it will be a cost , and it will be large -- nobody can gainsay that			1
instead , critics respond with a non-sequitur : never mind the effects on government budgets , look instead at immigration 's impact on the overall economy			1
the trouble for them , however , is that every reputable study -- headed by the most exhaustive of them all , the 1997 @entity137 study -- finds that the economic benefits of immigration are very small , fractions of a penny for each dollar of national income , with the largest share of those benefits captured by the immigrants themselves			1
but it 's a basic rule of politics : if you ca n't disprove the message , you try to discredit the messenger			1
and one of @entity76 's messengers sure enough proved discreditable			1
while work on the @entity76 study was led by that think tank 's welfare expert , @entity161 , the heavy number - crunching was done by a recent @entity163 , @entity65			1
@entity164 believes in a racial hierarchy of intelligence , with @entity167 and @entity168 at the top and blacks at the bottom			1
@entity164 has expressed that opinion in a number of places , including at a 2008 panel discussion at the @entity176			0
i happened to be the moderator of that panel			0
i had n't met @entity164 before , and this discussion was my first introduction to his work			1
afterward , i asked him to come to my office for a talk			0
i told him then that he faced a choice : he could be a serious scholar of immigration -- or he could play in the fever swamps , but not both			1
obviously , he did not heed my advice			0
shortly after , he left @entity176 to find employment at @entity76			1
@entity84 immigration policy has long been sullied by racial prejudice : the @entity192 , the 1907 deal with @entity194 to stop migration from that country , the immigration acts of 1921 and 1924 that sought to halt migration of all groups except @entity200 @entity23			1
it 's a shameful story , and the @entity65 episode scratches at those painful national wounds			1
but it 's also true that math is math. we know how much low - skilled legal immigrants earn			1
we know how much government assistance legal immigrant households use			0
we can make projections about the likely budget costs of enrolling 10 + million formerly illegal residents as legal ones			1
maybe @entity164 did his math wrong			0
if he did it wrong , it would remain wrong even if he spent his leisure hours rescuing orphans from burning buildings			0
maybe he did his math right			0
then it would remain right even if he moonlighted as @entity221 of the @entity222			0
yet what is especially strange about the @entity164 incident is this : the people who will lose most by the @entity82 's immigration plan are precisely @entity84 citizens of minority origin			1
blacks and @entity230 are more likely to be unemployed than whites			0
more ominously , they are more likely to be numbered among the long - term unemployed -- people who have been out of work six months or more			0
the long - term unemployed face an especially difficult path back to the labor market			0
the @entity239 reports : " though businesses are reluctant to acknowledge bias in their hiring practices , some human - resource managers and consultants say privately that unemployment can be a red flag on a @entity248 © @entity247 © , signaling that a worker may have outdated skills , or may be a short - timer who is desperate enough to take any work now but will leave when something better comes along			0
the @entity255 , a nonprofit advocacy group , reported that companies across the country often posted job notices explicitly excluding applicants who are unemployed			0
" such discrimination against the unemployed is becoming more widespread as jobs are in short supply and employers can have their pick of applicants , according to labor and community leaders			0
they say it has created a blacklist of the unemployed , many of whom were laid off in recession - driven downsizing rather than because of performance issues			0
" in @entity275 , on average , 372,000 people were unemployed in 2012 , 38 percent for a year or longer , according to the @entity276			0
blacks and @entity230 accounted for disproportionately large shares of the long - term unemployed			0
" there 's only one way to prod employers to hire the long - term unemployed : super-tight labor markets			1
in the late 1990s , when the unemployment rate tumbled to the lowest levels since the mid- 1960s , employers became interested in categories of workers they usually rejected : former welfare recipients , the disabled , and so on			0
in the late 1990s , the black - white wage differential closed at the fastest rate since the civil rights era			0
the @entity292 has hit almost all @entity84 hard			0
but -- no surprise -- mass unemployment has had its worst effect on the poorest and most marginal			0
a 2013 study by the @entity297 found that before the recession , the typical white family had four times the wealth of the typical black family			1
since the recession , the gap has widened to six - to - one			0
the only thing that can close this gap is to tighten the labor market			0
and yet the @entity82 plan is a plan to slacken labor markets , and keep them slack for decades			0
that 's not a bug			2
not only will the plan legalize the formerly illegal , but it will hugely increase future immigration flows of both permanent and temporary workers : agriculture workers , technology workers , even ski instructors			2
the labor market is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as any other market			0
if supply is dramatically increased at a time when demand is already low , expect wages to steeply fall			0
that 's not an unintended effect of the immigration bill			1
it 's the intended effect			2
@entity84 's legacy of racial oppression casts a long shadow			2
that legacy is not yet anywhere close to overcome			0
yet it 's more than a little astonishing that the proponents of the @entity82 immigration bill would claim the banner of anti-racism to justify a measure that will deepen and prolong the subordination of those @entity84 ethnic groups already most deeply subordinated			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity345 .			1

@entity345 : @entity65 report estimated cost of immigration **reform**
he says study 's **co-author** believes in an *offensive* theory about race and intelligence
@entity358 : **co-author** 's views *reprehensible* , but that does n't *invalidate* @entity76 findings
@entity358 : immigration **reform** will add substantial costs for *entitlements*
