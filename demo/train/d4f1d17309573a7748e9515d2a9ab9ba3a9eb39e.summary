@entity0 -- @entity3 's top human rights watchdog has urged @entity4 to stop offering sexual offenders the option of surgical castration			1
the @entity9 's anti-torture committee said in a report issued wednesday that the practice , which aims to help convicted sex criminals rein in their sex drives and lower their risk of reoffending , could easily be regarded as " degrading treatment			1
" according to @entity4 's @entity17 on @entity18 , a person over the age of 25 may be subjected to surgical castration if he " displays an abnormal sex drive , which ... gives reason to suspect that he will commit one or more criminal offenses			2
" the controversial procedure is not mandatory and a consensual offender can only have the operation after being informed of all the implications of the decision and after medical approval has been obtained , @entity4 said in its response , adding that it would consider reviewing the issue			0
but @entity0 also cited the treatment 's effectiveness , saying that of the 104 people who underwent the procedure in the 1970s , only three people committed sexual crimes again			0
nearly half of the 53 others who refused or were denied treatment eventually reoffended			0
voluntary castration is still very rare in @entity4 , with fewer than five cases per year in the last decade			0
the only other country in the 47 - nation bloc of the @entity9 that offers the process is the @entity48 , which has also been the subject of criticism in recent years for allowing sex offenders to opt for castration , a procedure it uses far more frequently than @entity4 .			1

the @entity9 says surgical castration may *qualify* as " degrading treatment "
the procedure is voluntary for sex offenders in @entity4
the @entity48 is the only other *member* of the @entity9 to perform the procedure
