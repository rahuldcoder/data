@entity0 -- on a recent friday , i stepped into a place i had n't been in years			1
" oh , wow ! " @entity4 , my longtime hair stylist , said as i entered the salon			1
he 's been cutting my hair for a decade , but he had n't seen me in about 26 months			1
chuckling at his reaction , i thought back to the dozen times over the previous year that my good friend , @entity9 , had told me he was going in for a trim and i asked him to assure @entity4 i had n't fired him			2
i slipped into the black chair and watched in the mirror as @entity4 carefully separated my bouffant into about 15 ponytails an inch or two above my scalp			2
the mildly uncomfortable hair - pulling process was the requisite for @entity19 , a charity that manufactures wigs for youngsters with illnesses			1
have you donated your hair to charity ? tell us your story before i get into how @entity4 lopped off 13 inches of my hair , let me explain how i came to acquire the mop atop my head			1
my mum passed last may			2
a few months before she bravely marched on , i was visiting her at her @entity32 , @entity33 , home , where she was essentially bedridden			2
she noted my hair was getting long			1
" i 've never seen your curls like this , " she said , reaching up and taking one of the corkscrews in her fingers			1
why have you never grown it out before ? " the answer was simple : pops would have skewered me			2
a hippie or woman my father had died a few years earlier , but he had instilled in me since my teen years that certain things do n't belong on boys , long hair among them			1
another no - no was earrings			2
i vividly recall being shamed into removing the one i acquired in high school over spring break in @entity56 , @entity57			2
it rested in my lobe for only a week , but pop 's constant harassment those seven days -- primarily manifested in accusations that i had turned into a hippie or a woman -- eventually convinced me to extract the cubic zirconia stud			2
there are only so many times you can hear your father joke , " i 'm heading to the store			2
you need anything ? skirts ? tampons ? " when mum passed , it had been a while since my last haircut			1
it was already getting long for my taste			1
why i went another year without cutting it , i am not sure			2
maybe it was cathartic , or perhaps it was because mum said she liked it			2
maybe i was just getting back at dad for making me take out the earring when all the cool kids had one			1
i just let it grow , and gravity eventually pulled the corkscrews past my shoulders			2
problems ensued , issues i had never faced before			2
my hair would get caught in things like the recliner and my laptop			1
if i rested sunglasses on my dome , the curls stubbornly entangled the nosepiece			1
when eating on patios , the wind would blow the locks into my mouth alongside a forkful of food , an awkward ( and kinda gross ) sensation to say the least			1
on vacation in @entity111 several weeks back , it became too much			0
the humidity left me drenched			0
i could n't cool off			0
my hair kept falling into my eyes			1
i emerged from a swim in the ocean looking like @entity116			0
i tried putting it in a ponytail , something for which i had previously never found cause in life			0
it provided relief from the heat , but if you put me in a pastel leisure suit i could 've doubled for a drug lord on " @entity128			0
" not really the look i was going for			0
the hair had to go			1
i mentioned this to friends , who had mixed responses			1
some had grown accustomed to the shaggy locks ; others had been praying i 'd get a trim			1
one suggested i donate my hair			1
my first reaction : " who the hell would want my hair ? " shorn for a cause a little research yielded many takers : charities that collect the hair to make wigs for the terminally ill , namely cancer patients whose radiation or chemotherapy treatments had caused their hair to fall out			1
sufferers of alopecia and trichotillomania also receive the wigs			1
some of the groups crafting hairpieces include @entity157 , @entity158 for kids , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164			1
i wo n't purport to have done my journalistic due diligence on which organization is " the best			0
" i 'm sure they all have merits , despite the lack of diversity in naming them			0
i chose wigs 4 kids because it focuses on children , had great reviews , spends 80 % of its budget on programs and its website features a charming before - and - after photo gallery of wig recipients			1
their smiles were so much wider in the pictures where they showed off their new hair than in the photos depicting them bald			1
the resplendent grins reminded me of a charity my pal helps organize here in @entity0 , the @entity191			1
the group takes musicians to children 's hospitals , not only to play music but also to let the kids join in -- singing , songwriting , strumming axes , banging on drums			1
the little rock stars are giddy when they get their chance on the mic			0
wigs and drums may not seem as important as efforts to , say , find cures to the diseases ailing these youngsters , but until cures are found , there is more to treatment than palliative care			1
self - esteem can go a long way in a youngster 's fight to survive , providing her / him with the necessary confidence to believe the battle is a winnable one			1
innocent as they often may be , kids can be cruel			1
we 're all familiar with the schoolyard clique or bully that picks on the kid who 's smaller or different in some way			0
as @entity231 notes , illness can further isolate a child			0
so while a wig may seem like a small gesture , being able to scamper across a baseball field or twinkle - toe across a dance studio -- without worrying about your hairpiece falling off or your baldness making you an outcast -- that can be an enormous deal			0
it 's a chance to earn acceptance , to show you 're a lot like everyone else , no matter what ails you			0
most importantly , it 's a chance to be a kid when a dastardly disease is doing its best to make you grow old faster than you 'd like			0
chop and a snip that 's what compelled me to finally call @entity4			0
i did n't have any @entity257 connection to my hair so it was a fairly emotionless ordeal , though we both had good laughs as he finished up the ponytailing process			2
a cup of gin and juice and some melanin , and i would 've made a decent @entity266			0
@entity4 felt it wise to document the look in digital imagery			0
i was sure the pictures would never see the light of day , but i 've found myself sharing them with friends who were all too willing to join me in laughing at myself			1
@entity4 finished by carefully scissoring off each ponytail and laying it on a table so it could be prepared for shipping			0
when he was done , he exclaimed with surprise , " did you know these were under here ? ! " thinking i had a rash or perhaps birds nesting in the ' fro , i nervously replied , " no ! what ? " " these chops , " he said , laughing			0
i confessed to knowing about the sideburns , though i had n't given them much thought as they 'd been obscured for months			0
i told him he could go ahead and cut them off			0
he declined , saying they " square up " my face			0
i still do n't know what that means , but i assumed from his tone it 's a good thing			0
in all , it took about 90 minutes to get me seriously streamlined			0
i got the double - take all last week from co-workers who were surprised to see me show up monday with a buzzcut and sideburns			0
some mocked me , asking if i 'd lost a bet or expressing relief i no longer looked like a @entity305			0
me , i 'm much cooler now , which is important considering the sweltering @entity0 summer is almost upon us			0
i 'm also pleased that my 26 - month grooming experiment served some purpose other than catharsis , if that 's what it was			0
i 'll even go so far as to thank our weekend homepage editor for convincing me to write in the dreaded first person so we could educate people about donating ' dos to organizations aiming to normalize a few challenging lives			0
but this will probably ( read , most definitely ) be my last foray into writing about hair			2
if you 'll excuse me , i 'll go back to writing about hard news , sports and hip - hop now .			0
