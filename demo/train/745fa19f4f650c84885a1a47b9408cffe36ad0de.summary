@entity0 stood in the doorway , talking to sheriff 's deputies who had come to check on his welfare , and worried that his plan to kill was over			1
last month , officers visited @entity0 , 22 , who they say killed six people and himself friday night , at his apartment in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" i had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what i was planning to do , and reported me for it , " @entity0 wrote toward the end of a 137 - page account of his life			1
" if that was the case , the police would have searched my room , found all of my guns and weapons , along with my writings about what i plan to do with them			1
" i would have been thrown in jail , denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies			2
i ca n't imagine a hell darker than that			2

@entity0 said he was having troubles with his social life			1
he was timid , " @entity37 told @entity36 on sunday			2
there was nothing in his behavior to suggest he was violent , and the deputies " determined he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold , " @entity37 said			1
@entity0 wrote that a wave of relief came over him when the deputies left			1
" if they had demanded to search my room ... ( t ) hat would have ended everything			2
for a few horrible seconds , i thought it was all over			2
" after that , @entity0 wrote , he kept one of his guns and some loaded magazines near him so if police came back to his apartment , he would try to shoot them and escape			1
" thankfully , all suspicion of me was dropped after i took down the videos from @entity85 , and the police never came back			2
" " it was all because of the videos			2
i must have expressed too much anger in them			2
i immediately took most of them off of @entity85 , and planned to reupload them a few days before the @entity93			0
" @entity0 uploaded a video friday , calling it his last			1
sheriff : plan took a year the angst leading up to friday 's evening of horror was years in the making			1
the plan to kill many people apparently had come together in the past year , @entity37 said			1

" " on the day of retribution i 'm going to enter the hottest sorority house of @entity125 , " he said in the video			0
" i 'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you			0

minutes later , @entity0 sprayed bullets at the house from across the street , @entity37 said			1

" there was a young girl , laying right here			0

" i saw a gunshot wound to her abdomen , also one to her side and one through her head			1
" she was n't alone			0
" there was a girl right here and she was really struggling			0
you could tell she was barely able to move her eyes and just moving her arms slightly , " @entity148 said			0
" and there was another girl right here			0
you could tell she was lying down crouched			0
she was still conscious , talking			0
" by the end of the night , two of the three young women had died -- @entity171 , 22 , and @entity172 , 19			2
both were students at @entity125			0

" @entity192 continues @entity0 then zoomed around town in a black @entity194 , stopping at a delicatessen where he shot and killed @entity196 , another @entity125 student			1
exactly why , no one knows for sure			0
@entity0 got back in his car , and the killing rampage continued			1
he dashed around town , reportedly driving down the wrong side of the road so he could fire out the driver 's side window near the sidewalk			0
he shot at two people on the sidewalk , pulled a handgun on a woman and fired some more , @entity37 said			2
he encountered a sheriff 's deputy who was on foot and exchanged gunfire			0
witness @entity213 said he was inches away on the street when the gunman 's car sped up and struck two bicyclists			0
" it happened so fast , " he said			0
" i had no time to react			0
i jumped on the sidewalk and i see a man on a @entity194 , his body inside the windshield and glass broken everywhere			0
... i almost wanted to break into tears			0
" the nightmare finally ended after @entity0 slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head , police said			1
by the time the melee was over , six victims were dead , 13 were injured , and a quiet beachfront community was left to wonder how this could happen -- and whether anyone could have prevented it			2
in the nearly seven - minute video posted friday , @entity0 rants about women who ignored or rejected him over the past eight years , " since i hit puberty			1
" " tomorrow is the day of retribution , the day in which i will have my revenge , " he says in what he calls his last video			0
" you girls have never been attracted to me			0
i do n't know why you girls are n't attracted to me , but i will punish you all for it			0
" he specifically criticized sorority members			0
unused ammo it 's unclear what @entity0 might have done had he not wrecked his car			1
inside the wrecked @entity194 , @entity37 said , police found three handguns -- all legally purchased -- and more than 400 rounds of unused ammunition			0
@entity37 said the guns were purchased the firearms over the past year in three different cities			2
@entity196 's father , @entity259 , said some politicians and the @entity261 are also to blame for his son 's death			0
" @entity264 died because of craven , irresponsible politicians and the @entity261 , " he said			0
" they talk about gun rights -- what about @entity264 ' right to live ? when will this insanity stop ? " @entity0 suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue and was under the care of a variety of health care professionals , @entity37 said			1
but there was no indication he had been committed to a mental health facility			0
@entity0 passed the background check needed to buy the firearm used in the shooting , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told @entity36			1

the manifesto in the manuscript of his life 's story , @entity0 often mentioned feeling slighted or inferior , such as when he was denied entry on an amusement park ride at age 6 while other boys his age got to go on			1
" being denied entry on a simple amusement park ride due to my height may seem like only a small injustice , but it was big for me at time , " @entity0 wrote			1
" @entity311 did i know , this injustice was very small indeed compared to all the things i 'll be denied in the future because of my height			0
" he described his parents ' divorce as a devastating , " life - changing event , " but said he gained more respect for his father after he quickly acquired a girlfriend			2
" males who can easily find female mates garner more respect from their fellow men , even children , " @entity0 wrote			1
" how ironic is it that my father , one of those men who could easily find a girlfriend , has a son who would struggle all his life to find a girlfriend			2
" but the overarching theme of the manifesto focuses on his frustrations with women			1
" my orchestration of the @entity93 is my attempt to do everything , in my power , to destroy everything i can not have , " @entity0 wrote			1
" all of those beautiful girls i 've desired so much in my life , but can never have because they despise and loathe me , i will destroy			2
all of those popular people who live hedonistic lives of pleasure , i will destroy , because they never accepted me as one of them			2
i will kill them all and make them suffer , just as they have made me suffer			2
