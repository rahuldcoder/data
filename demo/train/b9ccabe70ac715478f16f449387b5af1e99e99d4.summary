-- an epic tour of the @entity2 is the time - tested way to see @entity4 -- if you 've got a month or three and a pile of cash			1
until you win the lotto , we 'll help you hit the grandest sites on your wish list			1
what exactly is a @entity13 ? it started in the 17th century as an extended -- make that a very extended -- @entity16 vacation for travelers with time and money to burn			1
any trip worthy of the name would last more than a month and include stops in at least @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
( when @entity27 and @entity28 got married in 1905 , they spent three months shopping and eating their way from @entity31 to @entity32			1
) the floodgates opened to the riffraff ( a.k.a. you and me ) after @entity37 , when transatlantic flights became more common and certain guidebook authors shared their tricks on how to vacation on the cheap			1
the " if it 's tuesday , this must be @entity46 " incarnation of the @entity13 -- which whipped travelers through a dizzying number of countries in a week or two -- passed the baton to the popular diy version undertaken by recent college grads : the rail pass / hostel / @entity50 - type adventure			1
@entity0 : 4 most common reasons airlines lose luggage how can i pull off a trip like that today ? your best bet is to go guided			1
a good outfitter can eliminate many of the headaches you can get from hopping across the @entity2 : blindly choosing hotels and restaurants , navigating the maze of trains and planes and orienting yourself in an unknown city			1
" guests come back from our trips overjoyed that they actually got to look up from their guidebooks , " says @entity68 , the vice president of marketing for @entity70 family of brands , an international organization that runs more than 3,500 trips to @entity4 annually			1
" they also love that when things are prebooked with a package , there 's no waiting on line for admissions			1
" @entity70 's most popular @entity86 tour is the 11 - day @entity4 itinerary , which starts in @entity32 and loops through @entity88 on its way to @entity31 ( from $ 1,999 per person )			2

@entity0 : 12 restaurants with spectacular views that sounds great , but i could never spend that much time sitting on a bus			1
the truth is , more and more outfitters have ditched the standard tour - bus and travel - by - number experience of the past			1
the newest itineraries from @entity121 - based @entity120 are a good example : their 15 - day @entity123 to @entity32 tours ( from $ 2,740 per person ) link stays at inns and @entity128 with jaunts on public transportation and include plenty of unscheduled time			1
cruises are an increasingly grand option , too			2
ships now sail the @entity137 and @entity138 year - round ; over the past 10 years the number of passengers touring these seas by ship has grown 163 percent			2
that 's not the only way to sail here , either			2
since 2004 , the number of @entity147 taking river cruises has jumped 60 percent , with the vast majority touring @entity16 rivers such as the @entity151 and @entity152			2

any suggestions ? you 're not alone there			2
" nobody i know can devote the month off that a ' grand trip ' to @entity4 would entail , " says @entity174 , the editor of travel website gonomad.com			2
" nowadays , you 're looking at more like a week or 10 days at the most , so people are no longer trying to do the whole continent on a single trip			1
" at the same time , flights to @entity4 have become even more plentiful , so there 's less incentive to save up money ( and vacation days ) for an epic journey when you can easily manage a weekend jaunt to @entity31 or @entity32			1
" some travelers still feel the pressure to see and do it all , like they 're on a mission , " @entity68 says			0
" but more and more , travelers want to slow down and experience places in depth			1
" outfitters have started offering a lot of itineraries with this in mind			0
in the past two years , for instance , the most popular tour offered by @entity120 has been its 15 - day @entity204 trip ( from $ 2,545 per person ) , followed closely by the eight - day @entity206 ( from $ 1,735 per person ) and 15 - day @entity208 ( from $ 2,420 )			0

their baggage fees can add up , but their fares are hard to beat : a recent search on @entity220 found one - way flights from @entity88 to @entity32 for $ 12 ! if you have more time and would prefer to go by train , you do n't necessarily need a pricey rail pass			1
@entity230 , who maintains a @entity16 - train guide at @entity232 , generally advises booking point - to - point tickets with the service provider — such as bahn.com for trips in @entity236 or tgv - europe.com for @entity24 's high - speed line			0
just remember one thing : " grand " does n't have to mean " once in a lifetime			0
" do n't try to see and do too much			0
