-- hungry for the comforting food you grew up with ? thanks to some enterprising online retailers , your favorite regional flavors may be just a click away			1
cookbook authors @entity9 and @entity11 now split their time between @entity12 and their childhood hometown of @entity14 , @entity15			1
but adjusting to the @entity16 was n't easy at first for the two brothers			0
during their first @entity12 winter in 1994 , the @entity11 brothers suffered from serious twinges of homesickness			0
they sought solace in a childhood favorite -- the unroasted , saltwater - boiled peanuts sold by roadside vendors back home			1
after procuring 50 pounds of raw peanuts from a @entity29 produce market , they set a portion to boiling in a stockpot on the stove			2
" within minutes of our return , the apartment began to fill with steam that smelled like hay , sweet potatoes and tea ; about eight hours later , we were cracking the peanut shells , with brine running over our hands , and slurping the nuts down , " the two wrote in their @entity46 - winning " the @entity47 " ( @entity48 )			0
the heavenly taste of the peanuts transported them home			1
" their earthy , beanlike flavor , in that cramped room overlooking the heroin dealers and hipsters on @entity54 , conjured up the creek banks and marshes south of @entity14			0
the feeling of having cheated geography through food was exhilarating , " they wrote			0
a legume - selling obsession began as the brothers sought to share the special treat			0
the @entity67 took to the streets -- and then a printed catalog and eventually set up a website , boiledpeanuts.com -- selling the peanuts and other regional staples such as sorghum molasses , pickled artichokes and watermelon rind and stone - ground grits to displaced @entity77 all over the country			1
but the @entity15 hardly has a corner on marketing to hometown appetites in other states			1
a server at the who 's on @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , was recently overheard advising a former native about where to buy the region 's signature processed ham , known as pork roll			1
said she , " i know there 's a website that sells it to people who miss it			2
wish i 'd thought of that -- i 'd make a million dollars			0
" she 'd have to woo customers away from other pork roll online providers such as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 -- all of which cater to the tastes of transplanted @entity110 , with the latter offering @entity113 favorites such as @entity114 and @entity116 's snack cakes , @entity118 's @entity117 and @entity120 's hot dogs			1
the website hones hunger pangs with a page sharing loyal patrons ' memories of @entity126			0
@entity128 customer @entity127 of @entity129 , @entity130 , remembers her family 's yearly stop at @entity134 's @entity126 booth			2
" @entity135 , a connoisseur of all delicious foods , felt the experience was worth the expense			0
we would each get a sandwich and i remember eating it as slowly as i could , savoring each delicious bite , knowing the memory of the sandwich would have to last a whole year			0
although my dad passed several years ago , when i savor one of your delicious pork roll sandwiches , i feel him with me			2
" soda fans misty for @entity152 's classic @entity151 , @entity157 's @entity155 or @entity156 favorite @entity153 can get their fix via @entity160 - based online retailer , the aptly named the hard to find grocer			1
the company , founded in 1996 , specializes in regional favorites that traditional grocery stores might not sell enough of to justify shelf room			1
as the physical space is a warehouse not open to the public , there 's plenty of room for @entity174 ' @entity173 's @entity172 and @entity175 , @entity15 's @entity176 -- an essential in many @entity77 recipes -- alongside pickles from @entity180 's @entity179 's and @entity183 's indigenous coffee syrup @entity181			1
devotees of particular products can either click over to aggregators of regional products , such as cincinnatifavorites , cajungrocer , tastesofchicago , newyorkfirst or themississippigiftcompany or go straight to the source			2
classic brands such as @entity193 's @entity192 soft drink and @entity194 's @entity194 , both established in the early 1900s , have embraced online marketing and selling to keep up with the demands of their widespread clientele			1
and these indulgences come at a price			0
often , small producers can not ship throughout the entire year -- for instance vendors of @entity205 's @entity204 can not subject their delicate , heat - sensitive delicacy to higher temperatures throughout the summer -- or must tack on shipping charges that may be equal or higher than the items being shipped			1
still , homesick eaters are more than willing to shell out for their beloved treats			2
" @entity213 is a major ingredient , and then the comforting effect that familiar foods have on the psyche			2
we tend to take the flavors of our upbringing for granted until we move away -- then they become priceless experiences , " @entity11 told @entity0			0
some favorite dishes do n't translate to those who did n't grow up treasuring them			0
this writer 's husband was less than impressed by the the traditional @entity231 - style , @entity227 - influenced @entity226 she 'd ordered online and served as a " @entity232 " with cheese and onions over spaghetti , while she blanches at the sugar shock of his beloved @entity193 sweet tea			1
but that 's not the end of the world			0
it just means you wo n't have to share your favorites .			0

these *include* boiled peanuts from the @entity15 , @entity86 's pork rolls , @entity253 's chili
