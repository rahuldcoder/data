-- @entity1 is doing its very best not to make you terribly sad			2
you see , it used to constantly show you photos of your ex , which might have reminded you just how great things were before he or she dumped you , but it has stopped that now			0
exes no longer show up in the " @entity13 " box			1
@entity14 appear in the top right corner of some @entity1 pages , including the friends and @entity19 sections			2
they show your friends tagged in photos long - forgotten , but the friends shown are picked using @entity1 's algorithm for figuring out whose updates you 're most interested in			1
the exact nature of the algorithm is unclear , but check it out and you 'll notice one pattern : it tends to show romantic interests a lot			0
is it because you 've clicked through their photos before ? because you exchange wall messages ? who knows , but it happens -- and that 's all well and good until you break up			0
once it 's over , though , it can be painful to see all those pictures			0
users created a group to protest @entity13 for that very reason			1
it caught the attention of not only the media , but of @entity1 photos project manager @entity51			2
yesterday he commented on a post about the issue over at @entity1 , saying , " i 'd like to let you know that we 're listening to your feedback			0
the photo memories product no longer shows tagged photos of your friends if you were previously in a relationship with them			1
" it 's a welcome change , but it does n't completely solve the problem			1
what if you never declared a relationship on @entity1 ? or what if it 's showing you your current squeeze ( and it will -- only about 1 in 10 photos the box shows me now are of anyone other than my girlfriend ) with one of his or her exes ? that 's no fun either			1
we 'd love to see a way to tweak exactly who can or ca n't be seen in this box , but we 'll admit most people would n't use it			0
most people just do n't manage their @entity1 data that carefully			0

your exes will no longer show up in your " @entity14 " @entity1 box
photo memories show your friends tagged in photos long - forgotten
users created a group to protest , which caught the eye of @entity104 manager
it 's a welcome change , but it does n't completely solve the problem
