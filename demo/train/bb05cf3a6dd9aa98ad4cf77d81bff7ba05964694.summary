@entity2 few @entity1 hopefuls would ever want to be compared to former president @entity4 , but some of @entity7 's pre-campaign moves -- or lack thereof -- are reminiscent of the 37th president			1
as @entity15 eyes another run at the presidency in 2016 , some close to her -- especially those who are cheering reports she may wait until summer to officially announce a bid -- point to @entity4 's successful 1968 presidential bid as a positive sign , particularly how @entity4 's public operation went dark for about six months before entering the race			1
despite being the presumed @entity23 front - runner since @entity24 was reelected in 2012 , @entity15 has been largely absent from the public spotlight since the midterms wrapped in november 2014			2
and with the exception of the occasional paid speech and non-profit event , she could lie - low through the spring , a months - long hiatus similar to one @entity4 took more than fifty years ago before winning the presidency for the first time			1
in " @entity33 : how @entity41 from @entity42 to create the @entity43 , " author and longtime @entity4 aide @entity34 retells the debate and intrigue around @entity4 deciding to take a six - month hiatus from presidential politics ahead of the 1968 election			1
the comparisons to @entity15 , while not perfect -- she is the same young lawyer who worked as an aide on the @entity4 impeachment trial of the former president -- are obvious			1
@entity15 is the favorite to win the @entity23 nomination in 2016 and has already had to deal with attacks about her not being a " fresh face			0
" a @entity3 / @entity55 poll out wednesday found that @entity15 leads the field with a whopping 61 %			0
both candidates have unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination before and held high profile @entity60 positions elevating their status and name recognition			0
@entity4 , who had then served a vice president for eight years but lost in the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 @entity67 gubernatorial race , was seen as the overwhelming favorite to win the @entity70 nomination in 1968			1
there was strong competition -- notably from then @entity74 gov. @entity73 -- but none had the support @entity4 had			1
that is why , according to @entity34 , it was shocking when @entity4 told an interviewer that after the 1966 midterm elections he was " going to take a holiday from politics for at least six months			1
" " is it really wise to cede the field to @entity73 and lock ourselves into a six - month moratorium with no flexibility , " @entity34 recalls asking @entity4			1
@entity4 pointedly responded : " let ' em chew on him for a little while			2
" " that is what he expected the press to do to @entity73			2
@entity73 , and that is what the press did , " @entity34 writes			2
" the new year would prove an annus horribilis for the governor of @entity74			0
" @entity34 adds : @entity4 knew " if he started out on a presidential campaign in 1967 , even as an unannounced candidate ... the press and public would tire of him and begin looking about for the ' fresh face			2
' thus he would back away and not appear center stage as a candidate until more than a year later			0
... it was a risky strategy and , judging by the results , a brilliant one			0
" @entity4 would go on to narrowly win the 1968 election over @entity111 @entity110 , but more importantly , he emerged from the @entity70 nomination process as the clear winner , trouncing @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity73			1
@entity34 , who ran for president three times , said he does see some of @entity4 's strategy in @entity15			1
" i see her more looking at the scene , asking , ' why move now , ' " he said			0
" i think that whole idea is absence makes the heart grow fonder			0
" he added that he was n't surprised @entity15 , despite her work to impeach @entity4 , has mixing his strategy			1
" what dictates the strategy is more the circumstance and the individual , " he said			0
" this was not just a lark , this was thought though			0
" by ducking from public events -- @entity15 had only two public events in january and has only one slated for february -- the frontrunner is clearly trying to lie low			1
@entity15 has four events planned for march , but that number is nothing compared to how many events she headlined in 2014			2
reports have surfaced that she may wait until summer to officially kick off a campaign , but @entity15 confidants have told @entity3 that they expect some sort of campaign move to happen in april			0
the @entity4 comparison favored by some close to @entity15 -- but also causing some in clinton - land to grimace -- have some			1
there are two obvious holes : the first being even if @entity15 decides to lie low , today 's media landscape does n't have to abide by her wishes			2
leaks about who she is hiring , where she may put her campaign headquarters and the problems she will face on the trail are rampant and the media is still as focused on her -- if not more -- than they were months ago			0
secondly , unlike @entity4 , @entity15 's crowded field of realistic challengers is n't in the primary			1
on her @entity23 side , vice president @entity169 , @entity23 @entity171 gov. @entity170 , sen. @entity172 from @entity173 and former @entity175 sen. @entity174 have n't really made much a splash in polling , and one of her closest liberal competitors has repeatedly said she 's not running			0
while @entity15 finds herself with over 60 % support , her next closest competitor , @entity169 , has gained six points since december and stands at 14 %			0
@entity187 follows at 10 %			0
instead , the real crowded field facing @entity15 comes mostly from republicans , who have roughly two dozen possible hopefuls who might compete for the presidential nomination			2
while the media spotlight has burned a few contenders , it 's unclear if those missteps on the @entity70 side will translate to @entity15 's benefit once she finally decides to officially hop into the race			0
quite simply , @entity15 does n't have a @entity73 for the media to " chew " on .			1

@entity7 's strategy of lying low has some @entity15 supporters thinking of @entity4 's 1968 election
@entity4 chose to take a six - month hiatus from presidential politics before 1968 in order to allow the press to " chew on " @entity73
@entity15 has been laying low for the better part of three months with only six events in january , february and march
