@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity3 on monday defended his opposition to a @entity6 bill that would expand education benefits for veterans , saying it would hurt the military that he hopes to lead			1
sen. @entity3 is co-sponsoring alternative legislation to the @entity12 that the @entity13 passed last week			1
the new @entity12 being debated in @entity14 would expand education benefits for veterans who served at least three years in the military after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
the bill 's main sponsor , sen. @entity20 , is a @entity22 @entity21 and , like @entity3 , a @entity23 veteran			2
the @entity13 passed @entity20 's bill 75 - 22 last week			0
@entity3 was not in @entity25 for the vote			0
@entity6 have targeted @entity3 for his opposition to the @entity20 legislation			1
watch @entity3 talk about the @entity30 debt to veterans saying he takes " a back seat to no one in my affection , respect and devotion to veterans , " @entity3 said @entity20 's bill would be a disincentive for service members to become noncommissioned officers , which he called " the backbone of all the services			2
" " in my life , i have learned more from noncommissioned officers i have known and served with than anyone else outside my family , " @entity3 said at a @entity45 event in @entity0			0
" they are very hard to replace			0
encouraging people to choose to not become noncommissioned officers would hurt the military and our country very badly			0
" a former @entity56 officer , @entity3 was a prisoner of war during @entity23			0
@entity3 , along with sens. @entity57 of @entity58 and @entity59 of @entity60 , has introduced an alternative bill that would increase education benefits on a sliding scale based on an individual 's years of service			1
@entity3 argues his bill would have a smaller impact on retention rates than the legislation that the @entity13 passed			0
" the office of president , which i am seeking , is a great honor indeed , but it imposes serious responsibilities , " the presumptive @entity71 nominee said			0
" i can only tell you , i intend to deserve the honor if i am fortunate to receive it , even if it means i must take politically unpopular positions at times and disagree with people for whom i have the highest respect and affection			0
" over the weekend , sen. @entity86 , who appears to be the likely @entity6 nominee , again tried to tie @entity3 to @entity88 by noting that both of them oppose the @entity12 expansion			1
" i revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect , " @entity86 said saturday			0
" i think the @entity12 is one way for us to do that , and i hope that @entity3 and @entity88 decide they believe the same thing			1
" sparring between @entity3 and @entity86 over the @entity12 @entity100 got personal last week when @entity3 said he would not be lectured from someone " who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform			1
" @entity86 has n't served in the military			2
referring to @entity108 in his closing comments monday , @entity3 said he recognized @entity30 have grown tired of the war and the mistakes made , " but we can not react to those mistakes by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake , a mistake of colossal historical proportions			1
" " we must give gen. [ @entity118 ] @entity117 and the @entity30 he has the honor to command adequate time to salvage from the wreckage of our past mistakes a measure of stability for @entity108 and the @entity126 , and a more secure future for the @entity30 people , " he said			1
later monday , @entity3 will attend a fundraiser in @entity0			1
on tuesday , president @entity88 will fly to @entity130 , @entity131 , for a fundraiser at a private residence			1
@entity88 has been one of the @entity71 's most prolific fundraisers , and @entity3 will need help to keep up with @entity6 fundraising this fall			1
the @entity3 campaign said the event will be held at the senator 's home because it is more private			0
but the @entity141 said the event was moved from the @entity143 due to lackluster ticket sales and concern over anti-war protesters			0
a @entity3 aide denied the report on poor ticket sales			0
the aide also said the event was n't moved to @entity3 's private residence to avoid having the senator and unpopular president appear together on camera			2
" we have a policy that fundraising events are closed events , " the aide said , adding that any confusion about the fundraiser originally being open to the press should be chalked up to the campaign " working out the kinks " on its first event with @entity88			2
@entity3 consistently has trailed the two remaining @entity6 presidential candidates in fundraising			2
the $ 17 million @entity3 raised in april was dwarfed by the nearly $ 31 million by @entity86 and the $ 21 million by sen. @entity167			1
@entity3 also trails both @entity6 in the amount of cash on hand			2
he had nearly $ 22 million in the bank at the end of april , while @entity86 had more than double that amount -- nearly $ 47 million -- and @entity174 had nearly $ 30 million			0
@entity2 's @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
