-- with 33 consecutive wins and six straight titles in 2011 , @entity1 is closing in on his lifetime goal			1
the @entity6 's explosive start to the new tennis season has seen him battle and bruise two of the game 's modern greats and former untouchables in @entity13 and @entity14			1
his run in the current campaign has seen him beat both @entity14 and @entity13 three times each -- consigning the @entity18 to his first clay - court defeat in nearly two years in @entity20 -- en route to entering the top 10 of all - time @entity23 winning streaks			2
his win at the @entity27 and present hot streak finds him ranked second in the world , but @entity1 has his sights firmly focused on achieving a long - held goal			1
if he wins his seventh crown at the @entity32 ahead of his 24th birthday on may 22 , and no. 1 @entity13 fails to make the semifinals , @entity1 will proudly sit atop the rankings for the first time in his career			1
he told @entity0 's @entity38 : " it is my lifetime goal , my highest ambition , my dream as well , but i 'm still 23 , 24 this year			1
i still believe that i can play for many more years to come in this high level in the @entity23			0
" if i really want to be one of the candidates for the top spot , i have to play consistently well throughout the whole year , because that is what @entity13 and @entity14 will do and that 's what they have been doing the last five years , winning major events , being at least in the semis for every major event			2
" if i want to compete with them and keep up with them , i will have to do the same at least			0
" if @entity1 's rise to prominence in the game from 2005 onwards was steady , his leap into @entity13 and @entity14 's place at the top table of tennis has been dramatic			1
he secured his first major title back in 2008 at the @entity27 , and solidified his position as world number three , but the glut of grand slam titles many had predicted did not materialize			1
he reached the quarterfinals , or better , in each of 2010 's four slams and again finished the year third behind @entity13 and @entity14 , but after leading @entity6 to a landmark @entity73 triumph over @entity75 in december , @entity1 has n't looked back			1
his 33 wins have included three final defeats of @entity13 , the most notable coming in the recent @entity79 , when @entity1 inflicted the @entity18 's first reverse on clay in 38 matches			1
so , what is the secret to his blistering start in 2011 ? " everything kind of came together , " he told @entity0 anchor @entity86			2
" everybody is wondering what the secret is -- there is no secret			0
" i had the team of people i 've had for the last two or three years , it just took time for me to get all the things right and kind of have this necessary life experience in tennis			0
" @entity1 's imperious form has sent confidence levels soaring , and he attributes his success to a solid mental approach			2
" there is this saying that players use , that when you 're so confident that the tennis ball looks like a watermelon , so it probably is the case with me in the last couple of months , " he explained			0
" i am playing the best tennis of my life and i 'm on an incredible run			0
did i expect that ? no , definitely not , but i am trying to keep up with this momentum and trying to keep up with this high level of performance as much as i can			0
" despite his mesmerizing run during the first five months of the season , @entity1 insists @entity13 is still favorite to retain his @entity120 crown next month and make it six wins in seven years			2
and while the @entity6 says he wo n't retain his winning streak throughout the entire year , he does admit he is going into the tournament a transformed man			0
" i do n't expect myself to not lose a match throughout the whole year , but i am confident that i am a different player from last year , " he said			0
" i 'm emotionally stable , i 'm very confident , i am fast on the court and i am just consistent			0

@entity1 tells @entity0 's @entity38 show his lifetime goal is to become world no. 1
@entity6 's 33 straight victories in 2011 have brought him six titles
the 23 - year - old won his second grand slam at the @entity27 in *january*
@entity1 is world no. 2 to @entity13 , who he has beaten in three finals this year
