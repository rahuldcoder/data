the head of the opposition @entity1 told @entity3 's @entity2 on thursday he has intelligence showing @entity7 president @entity6 's government is moving its chemical weapons out of the country			1
" today , we have information that the regime began to move chemical materials and chemical weapons to @entity16 and to @entity17 , " gen. @entity10 said from inside @entity7			1
@entity3 could not independently verify @entity10 ' claim			0
several senior @entity20 officials told @entity3 's @entity21 that they have not seen movements into @entity16 or @entity17 , and that they did not believe it made sense for the @entity7 to be moving weapons so soon			1
and @entity17 categorically denied that chemical weapons had crossed into its territory , with an adviser to @entity17 prime minister @entity29 speculating " there is a political agency behind this claim			1
" " we were the victims of chemical weapons under @entity37 's regime , " said the adviser , @entity33			2
" and we will never allow to let any country to transfer chemical materials to our lands at all			0
" still , if the allegation were true , it could fundamentally shift the assessments of @entity45 intelligence officials , @entity3 's @entity41 reports			0
namely , these officials have said that @entity6 would not disperse his stockpile of chemical weapons because he knows the @entity45 would not bomb it , that @entity7 security forces firmly control the weapons and that there exists a large , secure infrastructure that has been moving these arms from rebel - held areas			1
moving these weapons into @entity17 , @entity16 or some other country outside @entity7 might prompt @entity45 intelligence authorities to question whether they were being transferred by a rogue element or whether it was evidence of a crack in the government 's control			1
the @entity7 opposition is afraid , @entity10 told @entity3 's @entity2 , that @entity6 's forces will then use those weapons sometime in the future -- even after the international effort to collect and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal is finished			1
" the regime , " he said , " is behaving like @entity37			0
" @entity10 said he talked thursday about what 's happening diplomatically with @entity45 secretary of state @entity73 , who the rebel leader claimed told him " that he will discuss with the @entity76 how honest the regime is			2
" " and if our friends discover that the regime is trying to play games and waste time , " @entity10 said by way of summarizing @entity73 's remarks , " the threat of the strikes is still on the table			0
" earlier on thursday , @entity10 told @entity86 that he had not received " any weapons from our @entity45 friends , " despite reports that lethal aid had indeed started reaching the @entity7 opposition			1
that includes a @entity45 official who told @entity3 on wednesday that light and anti-tank weapons as well as ammunition -- paid for by the @entity45 albeit made elsewhere -- had begun flowing to @entity7 rebels over the past two weeks			2
@entity10 told @entity2 that he " ca n't talk about weapons , " though he did stress that opposition forces were getting help			2
" we are getting now a lot of support from our @entity45 friends , but i ca n't talk in detail about all kinds of the support , " he said			2
for its part , the opposition will support efforts to take control of and eventually dismantle @entity7 's chemical weapons , with @entity10 saying , " we will do our best to help them			1
" but the rebel leader questioned that things will play out as hoped			0
" i think the regime will prevent them to go to the locations and to do their job , " @entity10 said			0
" i think the regime will tell them , ' today you ca n't go out of the hotels because the situation is very dangerous , and tomorrow you ca n't go , ' and they will delay and delay			0
" and even if @entity10 is proven wrong and @entity7 's chemical weapons are wiped out as part of this process , the rebel leader stressed that bigger issues remain in a civil war that the @entity130 estimates has killed more than 100,000 people -- most of them by conventional weapons			1
" we have many , many problems with the regime , " he said			0
" the chemical weapons ( are ) not ... the only problem that we have			0

gen. @entity10 claims he has info showing @entity7 is moving chemical weapons
senior @entity20 officials say they have n't seen such movement ; @entity17 firmly denies it
the @entity1 chief says the rebels are getting " a lot of support " from the @entity45
he stresses that chemical weapons are one of many serious problems in @entity7
