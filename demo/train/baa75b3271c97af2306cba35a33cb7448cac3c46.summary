-- friends of a 22 - year - old @entity3 soldier suspected of spying expressed shock wednesday , describing him instead as a patriotic and simple country boy dedicated to his job			1
spc. @entity8 of @entity9 , @entity3 , was arrested friday at @entity10 , @entity11 , according to col. @entity12 , the public affairs officer at the base			1
the @entity14 did not disclose the circumstances surrounding @entity8 's arrest but his name immediately appeared online in conjunction with @entity19 , the @entity14 private suspected of leaking classified information to the website @entity22			1
but @entity25 spokesman @entity24 said @entity8 's arrest had no connection to @entity22			1
nor did it involve any transfer of information , @entity12 said			0
" while we ca n't go into any specifics , this is completely different than the @entity19 case in that it does not involve the transfer of data on computer networks , " he said			1
@entity12 said any information that might have been transferred was stopped and that " @entity8 was being observed well before any damage could have occurred			1
" @entity8 was hardly fitting of a spy persona , said longtime friend @entity40 of @entity9			1
" he 's just a simple country boy , " he said			1
" he was never the kind of guy who would get into trouble			0
" @entity8 was not even that computer - savvy , @entity40 said			2
@entity8 was assigned to the 164th @entity46 , 793rd @entity47 , 2nd @entity48 , known as the " @entity49			2
" the unit was sent earlier this year to @entity51			0
but @entity8 was part of the rear detachment and did not deploy , though his friends said he had done a tour the year before			1
@entity8 had been under investigation by the @entity25 and @entity14 counterintelligence agents , @entity12 said , and will face military charges sometime this week			1
@entity0 tried to contact @entity8 's family wednesday			1
a man who answered a telephone call placed to his family 's home in @entity9 said , " no comment , " and hung up			2
but his friends could not believe the news			2
" you 've got the wrong guy , " said @entity66			0
" that 's just not who he is			0
" @entity66 , who now lives in @entity71 , @entity72 , said @entity8 idolized his brother , who is also in the @entity14 , and that he had been in the @entity74 in high school			1
he was a supporter of @entity77 and the @entity79 war effort in @entity80 and @entity51 , his friend said			0
there was n't much to do in @entity9 so @entity8 and his high school buddies hung out at the mall or at @entity84 , @entity66 said			2
they were cut - ups , making @entity88 videos that spoofed @entity89 in the " @entity91 " movies			0
but @entity8 dreamed of joining the @entity14 and in 2007 , he enlisted			1
one summer day , while on leave from @entity51 , he showed up at @entity40 's house in @entity9			0
they drank a couple of beers and talked			0
@entity8 told him that it was hard being on edge all the time			2
but he was n't different at all , @entity40 said			0
" i suppose anybody can get messed up with the wrong crowd , " he said			0
" @entity103 could 've done that but he 's a smart guy			0
" @entity66 said the only way @entity8 would do something illegal would be if he thought he were protecting someone who had been wronged			2
but without any details yet of why the @entity14 suspected @entity8 , it was difficult for @entity66 to fathom that his friend might be in trouble			1
@entity8 was in custody wednesday at the @entity113			2
his arrest " was the result of the close working relationship between the @entity25 and its military partners in @entity11 , " said @entity114 , the special agent in charge of the @entity25 in @entity11			0
" through this ongoing partnership , we are better able to protect our nation			0
