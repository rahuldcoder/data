-- a @entity2 man is facing charges of aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor for what authorities say are three pictures -- none of them featuring an actual child 's body			1
instead , according to testimony presented at @entity16 's preliminary hearing in @entity17 , @entity2 , on wednesday , the photos feature the faces of three young girls placed on the nude bodies of adult females , @entity0 affiliate @entity12 reported			1
@entity23 said @entity16 told authorities " he wanted to see what they would look like as adults , " according to @entity12			1
two of the faces were of local girls -- a 10 - year - old and 12 - year - old , the station reported			1
the third face appears to be @entity36 , 16 , star of @entity38 's popular television series " @entity40 " and its big - screen adaptation , " @entity40 : the movie , " according to @entity12			1
investigators do not believe @entity16 had any contact with the three girls , but " when you have the face of a small child affixed to a nude body of a mature woman , it 's going to be the state 's position that this is for sexual gratification and that this is simulated sexual activity , " assistant district attorney @entity42 said during wednesday 's hearing			1
attempts to contact @entity42 by @entity0 wednesday were unsuccessful			2
cases like @entity16 's present a unique legal issue			1
the @entity61 @entity60 in 2002 ruled that " virtual child pornography , " in which no children were actually harmed , is protected speech and does not constitute a crime			1
since then , " more and more of these guys are using morphed images , image manipulations " in an attempt to circumvent prosecution , @entity66 , president of the @entity67 , said wednesday			0
such attempts are not always successful , @entity66 said , as charges can still be filed under obscenity laws or other statutes			2
also , other avenues can be pursued when the faces used are those of real , identifiable people , he said			2
" we see it all the time , " @entity66 said			0
" it makes it harder for law enforcement			0
it makes it tougher for prosecutors			0
" " it 's definitely on the increase , " said @entity88 , a former prosecutor and senior attorney with the @entity67 for the @entity90 , part of the @entity92			2
" people are trying to come up with creative ways to continue to sexually exploit children using digital evidence			0
" generally , what is seen is the " @entity102 effect , " in which people use the face of a child on an adult body or vice versa in an effort to get around the law , he said			1
nearly every state , however , has adopted a law in response to the @entity60 decision in the case , @entity88 said			0
for instance , @entity2 's laws state that in prosecuting the offense of sexual exploitation of a minor , " the state is not required to prove the actual identity or age of the minor			1
" as to the success of such prosecutions , " there have not been a huge number of them , " @entity66 said			0
while some have been successful and won convictions , many such cases are still in the appellate process			0
@entity88 said he believes it is too soon to gauge the success or failure of prosecutorial efforts , as the cases " are just being challenged now			0
" " it really is sort of a blending of technology and the law , " he said , and predicted such issues would become more common as society becomes more and more high - tech and technology is increasingly used in the commission of crimes			0
@entity16 was bound over to a grand jury , according to @entity22 online court records .			2
