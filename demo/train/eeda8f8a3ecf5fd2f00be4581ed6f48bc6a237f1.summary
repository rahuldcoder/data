@entity3 president @entity2 has issued an order preventing any court from overturning his decisions , essentially allowing him to run the country unchecked until a new constitution is drafted , his spokesman announced on state tv thursday			1
@entity2 also ordered retrials and reinvestigations in the deaths of protesters during last year 's uprising against strongman @entity15			1
that could lead to the reprosecution of @entity15 , currently serving a life prison term , and several acquitted officials who served under him			0
the order for retrials could please some @entity3 who 've expressed disappointment that security officers and others have escaped legal consequences over last year 's protester crackdown by the @entity15 regime			0
@entity3 and @entity2 proved ' pivotal ' in @entity29 cease - fire talks some demonstrators in @entity31 , however -- protesting for a fourth day against @entity2 and the growing influence of the @entity33 -- expressed anger over his assumption of more power			1
about 2,000 people protested thursday night in and around @entity39 , with some chanting " birth of a new pharaoh " and " @entity2 the dictator			1
" political rivals also expressed dismay thursday evening			0
" @entity2 is taking over the executive , judicial , and legislative powers in his hands , and this is a dangerous path , " said the @entity46 account of @entity47 , a former presidential candidate			1
" @entity2 has issued immunity to any laws he issues			2
this is the birth of a new dictator , " tweeted @entity53 , another former presidential candidate			0
hundreds of @entity33 supporters , meanwhile , stood outside the general prosecutor 's office thursday to support @entity2 's decrees			1
@entity2 declared that any laws or decrees he 's made since he took office june 30 , and until a new constitution is put in place , are final and can not be overturned or appealed , his spokesman said on state - run tv			1
@entity2 also declared that a 100 - man council drafting a new constitution , plus the upper house of parliament , can not be dissolved			1
and he granted the council two more months to finish a draft constitution , meaning the panel has six months to finish			2
that means @entity2 , who earlier this year took over legislative powers from the military council that ruled after @entity15 's ouster , could have at least six months of unchecked rule by decree			1
the draft constitution would go to a referendum before it is finalized			0
he also fired @entity3 's general prosecutor , who had taken criticism from protesters in recent months because they believe prosecutions over demonstrators ' deaths were insufficient			2
@entity2 swore in @entity86 as the new general prosecutor on thursday			1
@entity2 's moves come three days after the start of violent protests in central @entity31 , largely by people angry at @entity2 's government and the @entity33 , the @entity93 movement to which @entity2 belongs			1
they also come amid turmoil in the constitution panel , which has been torn between conservatives wanting the constitution to mandate @entity3 be governed by @entity101 's @entity100 law , and moderates and liberals who want it to say that @entity3 be governed by principles of @entity100			0
the announcements also come a day after @entity2 helped broker a cease - fire between @entity108 and @entity109 after an eight - day conflict between the sides			1
on wednesday , @entity2 released a statement saying he had canceled a planned trip to @entity114 -- sending his vice president instead -- to concentrate on internal political developments and the @entity108 - @entity109 cease - fire			1
thousands of people have protested in @entity31 since monday , chanting -- for the first time since @entity2 took office -- for the toppling of the regime			2
some in @entity39 held posters saying " no to the @entity33 , " and banned @entity33 members from entering the square			2
some protesters have thrown @entity128 cocktails and rocks at police , who have fired tear gas and birdshot at the demonstrators			0
one person has died and at least 80 have been injured in the protests , according to @entity137 , a @entity138 spokesman			0
nine police officers have been injured in the clashes so far , said @entity141 , an @entity142 spokesman			0
dozens of protesters have been arrested , said interior minister @entity145			0
cameras have been installed around @entity39 , its side streets and the @entity142 in an effort to determine the identities of people attacking security forces , he announced			0
@entity152 balance of power shifting more demonstrations are scheduled in @entity39 on friday			0
@entity155 , a criminal court judge in @entity3 's @entity157 district , said thursday night that he was " sad because what president @entity2 did is an assault on the legislative and judicial system			1
" " he defies anything the revolution stands for , and his actions are an insult to us as judges , " @entity155 said			0
" declaring that his laws can not be questioned is unacceptable , and we may see a general judicial strike			0
" @entity171 , a fellow with the @entity172 , said @entity2 not only is preventing the judiciary from overruling his decisions , but he also has " insulated the @entity33 - dominated ( constitutional panel ) from judicial oversight			1
" depsite the protests in @entity31 and objections from political rivals , @entity2 -- elected with nearly 52 % of the vote in a june runoff against former prime minister @entity182 -- enjoys the " best mobilizing capability in the country " in the @entity33 , @entity171 said			1
" if there 's a nationwide movement against this , you 'll ( also ) have a nationwide movement for it , " @entity171 said			0
after he was elected , @entity2 took legislative control from the @entity192 , which had ruled after @entity15 was deposed			2
earlier , the council dissolved parliament 's lower house , saying parliamentary elections that began in november 2011 were unconstitutional			0
@entity2 indicated in june he would call back parliament , but @entity3 's high administrative court upheld the dissolution			1
@entity15 and his former interior minister @entity200 were convicted and sentenced in june to life in prison on charges relating to the deaths of hundreds of protesters after a 10 - month trial , while six former government aides were acquitted			2
some @entity3 protested the sentences and acquittals			0
@entity2 , who still was running for office , said at the time that he would initiate new investigations if elected			2
