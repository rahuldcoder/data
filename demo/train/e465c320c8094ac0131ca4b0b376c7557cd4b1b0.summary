" you see a lot of fires , smoke coming out -- whether it 's a fuel station or a gas tanker			0
" hidden bombs and snipers but @entity6 , known for its ferocious acts of terror and military tactics , expected @entity70 forces to arrive at some point , so the militants were prepared with hidden bombs and snipers			2
" @entity6 had a tanker full of explosives that they tried to drive into the @entity17 , " @entity47 says			1
it caused a " really huge explosion , " followed by a " very large cloud of dust			0

six or seven members of the @entity10 forces were killed in explosions , a commander said			0
the @entity17 did not say whether they had captured any @entity6 fighters			1
