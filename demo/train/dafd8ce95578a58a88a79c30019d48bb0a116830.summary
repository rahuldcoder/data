-- for desperately ill patients with serious , life - threatening antibiotic - resistant infections , access to new antibiotics is a matter of life and death			1
all across @entity9 , people are dying from bacterial infections that we used to be able to cure with antibiotics			2
just this march , the @entity13 warned the public about a four-fold increase in one group of " nightmare bacteria , " carbapenem - resistant @entity18 , which kills up to 50 % of the people infected , and is on the rise			0
the annual impact of antibiotic resistant infections on the @entity9 health care system is estimated to be $ 21 billion to $ 34 billion in excess health care costs and more than 8 million additional hospital days			2
at the same time , we are not making new antibiotics fast enough to prevent these deaths			0
without new antibiotics , things we all take for granted , including surgery , chemotherapy , organ transplantation and premature infant care , will be in jeopardy			0
a streamlined but targeted approach that speeds regulatory approval of new antibiotics -- and limits their use to the sickest of the sick -- is an appropriate way to balance the safety risks of these new drugs with the lifesaving benefits they can offer patients who have no other treatment options			1
as a practicing infectious disease physician , my colleagues and i are seeing firsthand the devastating effects that resistant infections have on patients			2
consider @entity53 , who was a healthy , athletic 11 - year - old in 2011 before she spent five months in an @entity55 hospital battling several serious drug - resistant infections that her doctors did not have antibiotics powerful enough to treat			1
@entity53 ultimately needed a double lung transplant to save her life			0
the health care costs from her hospital stay alone totaled $ 6 million , and she will need medical attention and therapy for the rest of her life			0
as resistant infections like those that nearly took @entity53 's life continue to increase , the antibiotic pipeline is nearly dry , with few drugs in development that will work against the most alarming pathogens our patients face			1
a proposal from the @entity76 aims to address a key part of the problem by reducing the obstacles to regulatory approval of new antibiotics for use in a distinct , narrow group of people : patients with serious resistant infections that have no effective treatment options left			1
how will this make a difference ? the current regulatory environment in the @entity9 discourages drug companies from antibiotic research and development , and few firms are active in this area today			1
antibiotics also are n't as profitable as other drugs , such as those for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes , which patients often take for years			1
a more direct path for regulatory approval can encourage more companies to get involved in antibiotic development again			1
@entity76 's approach -- the @entity107 -- would speed patients ' access to new , lifesaving antibiotics by allowing the @entity111 to approve them for narrow use based on smaller clinical trials than required for more widely used antibiotics			1
under @entity107 , drug companies will still have to show that a drug 's benefits outweigh the risks in patients with serious infections			1
it 's an idea modeled after the successful @entity121 , which encourages the development of drugs for rare diseases			2
promoting the appropriate use of these new antibiotics is critical , because we know antibiotic misuse and overuse are significant drivers of drug resistance			2
special labeling will ensure narrow marketing of these drugs			0
educational efforts should be put in place to send a strong signal to health care providers , facilities and insurers that these drugs are only for patients who need them most			2
these drugs will also likely be priced higher , commensurate with their value as life - saving medicines , than traditionally approved antibiotics , another factor that will help limit their wider use			1
antibiotic stewardship programs , which encourage appropriate antibiotic use by providers and health facilities , will play a key role			0
these programs provide much needed support and guidance to clinicians and ensure that our precious resource of antibiotics will be used wisely			0
professional medical groups -- including the @entity163 -- public health organizations , patient groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers have voiced their support for @entity76 's proposal			0
@entity111 and several members of @entity170 are also interested in the concept and in moving it forward			0
to be sure , developing new antibiotics and speeding their approval process to treat seriously ill patients is just one way to grapple with this complex public health crisis			1
@entity76 also promotes enhanced public health efforts , including better data collection and surveillance of drug resistance and the use of antibiotics , improved infection prevention , antimicrobial stewardship , and stronger efforts to encourage the appropriate use of antibiotics in humans and on the farm			0
increased research funding to explore how antibiotic resistance develops and spreads is just as vital , along with additional economic incentives and regulatory clarity to boost antibiotic development			1
patients like @entity53 need our help			0
we must take action now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity205 administration is considering streamlining the approval process for antibiotics
@entity202 : for patients with life - threatening infections , access to new antibiotics is vital
she says by limiting their use to the sickest of the sick , we can *minimize* risks of new drugs
@entity202 : we need to encourage more companies to do antibiotic research and development
