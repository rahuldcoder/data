president @entity0 is set to close a week jam - packed with news of a breakthrough with @entity3 and new tensions with @entity5 on friday with a 1:30 p.m. est news conference			1
just weeks removed from huge @entity9 losses in the midterm elections , @entity0 's allies say he appears liberated -- taking executive actions to overhaul immigration rules , thaw the @entity15 ' economic and diplomatic freeze with @entity3 and more			1
here are some of the questions @entity0 will likely face as he confronts the press one more time before he heads to @entity19 for what 's left of 2014 : did november 's election result liberate you ? a president derided as overly cautious for much of the last six years -- especially since the @entity25 wave of 2010 -- is suddenly no longer hesitant to use every lever the @entity27 has to offer			1
he 's brokered a diplomatic breakthrough with @entity3 , halted deportations for more than 4 million undocumented workers , green - lit @entity32 restrictions on ozone emissions , endorsed net neutrality and extended talks with @entity36 to curtail its nuclear program			2
and that 's just been in the first six weeks since @entity9 lost the @entity40			0
with no more potential election results weighing on his actions , does @entity0 suddenly feel like he 's free to be the president he 's always wanted to be ? @entity25 scoff at this notion -- and they 're working quickly to curb @entity0 's executive authority			2
dozens of states are challenging his immigration action in court , while @entity50 is plotting to defund him on immigration and block parts of his @entity3 deal			2
the strength of @entity0 's resistance on @entity56 wo n't come fully into view until new lawmakers take office in january			2
was this the push @entity3 needed to embrace democracy ? republicans like @entity65 sen. @entity64 blasted @entity0 's deal to free @entity15 contractor @entity67 , trade three @entity3 spies for one @entity15 spy imprisoned in @entity3 and ease a host of @entity15 banking and travel restrictions and open an embassy in @entity75 in exchange for the release of 53 political prisoners and expanded internet access			1
their criticism : @entity0 just gave away the @entity15 ' best leverage to force @entity3 to abandon communism and embrace human rights , democracy and a greater connection to the outside world			1
he responded by pointing out those tactics had n't worked in the 50 years since the embargo			0
what was @entity0 's calculation on what this deal would mean for @entity3 's future ? what 's the next campaign pledge you 'll use your executive authority to fulfill ? @entity0 was widely mocked during the 2008 campaign for promising to engage directly , without preconditions , with the leaders of the @entity15 ' enemies			1
and yet his @entity3 deal , negotiated in secret for more than a year , shows @entity0 carrying through on that promise			1
@entity0 has just two years left in office to tackle a long list of complicated issues that played prominent roles in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns			0
will he finally close @entity110 ? will his approach to the international stage change now that election results are n't riding on how his moves are portrayed ? @entity116 's economy is tanking , but @entity117 is n't backing down			0
what 's next ? @entity116 's ruble has tumbled to historic lows , and its central bank raised its interest rate to a stunning 17 percent this week -- a downturn due to dropping oil prices and harsh @entity126 sanctions on the country 's oligarchs and its banking , energy and defense industries imposed as a result of the country 's annexation of @entity136 's @entity135			0
so @entity116 president @entity117 could have sent signals that he is willing to back off			2
instead , he used a three - hour long news conference thursday to compare @entity116 to a " bear " that the @entity15 and its @entity141 allies are trying to chain down before ripping out its " teeth and claws			1
" @entity0 and his top economic advisers have long insisted that the pressure of @entity126 sanctions will grow over time -- and there 's only so much @entity116 's economy can take			1
but @entity117 continues to resist that characterization			0
is a breaking point coming soon ? and if not , what will the @entity15 and @entity141 countries do to further pressure @entity117 ? related : @entity0 and @entity117 : from frosty to frozen what does @entity5 's @entity156 hack -- and @entity156 's decision to pull a film 's release as a result -- say about @entity15 ? the @entity0 administration is set to place the blame on @entity5 for hacking into @entity156 's computers and threatening attacks on theaters that show " @entity167 , " a movie that depicts the cartoonish assassination of @entity5 leader @entity170			0
@entity156 subsequently decided to halt the film 's planned release			0
@entity0 could be asked whether @entity156 was wrong to pull the movie -- and whether it 's troubling that a major company was so easily cowed			0
he could also face questions about whether there 's the @entity156 hack will build momentum in @entity50 for cybersecurity legislation that would increase data sharing between companies and the @entity15 government			1
other similar questions : is @entity156 's vulnerability an ominous sign for other corporate giants , the government , financial services institutions and more ? are cyber attacks akin to acts of violence ? what can the @entity15 do to better defend itself against future attacks ?			0

president @entity0 has a year - end press conference *scheduled* for friday *afternoon*
he is sure to face questions on @entity3 , cybersecurity and @entity116
@entity0 and family will depart for their @entity19 *vacation* friday night
