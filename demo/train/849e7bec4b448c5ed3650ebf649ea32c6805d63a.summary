-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 killed plans for a new train tunnel to connect his state with @entity8 's @entity7 island thursday , saying billions of dollars in possible cost overruns made the project " completely unthinkable			1
" the $ 8.7 billion tunnel beneath the @entity12 was the largest public works project in the @entity14 , but @entity1 said it was likely to cost up to $ 5 billion more than estimated			1
in a statement announcing his plan to withdraw from the project , he said the tunnel " costs far more than @entity2 taxpayers can afford , and the only prudent move is to end this project			1
" " i have made a pledge to the people of @entity2 that on my watch i will not allow taxpayers to fund projects that run over budget with no clear way of how these costs will be paid for , " said @entity1 , a @entity23 elected in 2009			1
" considering the unprecedented fiscal and economic climate our state is facing , it is completely unthinkable to borrow more money and leave taxpayers responsible for billions in cost overruns			0
" the tunnel , dubbed the @entity41 to the @entity43 project , was aimed at doubling the number of commuter trains between @entity8 and @entity2 and increasing the number of @entity48 trains serving the @entity49			1
it would have included an expansion of @entity8 's @entity52 , created 6,000 jobs and taken 22,000 cars off the road , according to @entity56 and the @entity57 and @entity2			2
@entity58 , the head of the @entity59 , said @entity1 's decision " is really going to take a hit on @entity2 's economic growth			1
" he said the $ 5 billion estimate for overruns that @entity1 cited is overstated , with the actual number being closer to $ 1 billion			2
" this is a potential overrun that 's many years down the road			0
it should not have been used as the excuse to kill this project , " he said			0
the @entity57 and the @entity72 each put up $ 3 billion for the access to the @entity43 project , with the state of @entity2 adding in $ 2.7 billion			1
the project also was partially funded by federal stimulus money			0
" @entity2 definitely has extreme financial burdens that they are dealing with , " said @entity58 , the executive director of the transportation and urban planning think tank			2
" however , access to the @entity43 was one project that was very well funded from federal and bi-state sources			0
very little of the money was actually coming from @entity2 citizens			2
" opponents of the planned tunnel said they would rather see @entity2 's share of the money go to the state 's @entity91 , which is rapidly running out of money			1
supporters of the project proposed covering any budget shortfalls with a surcharge on train tickets or an increase in @entity2 's gasoline tax , the third - lowest in the country			1
but @entity1 has said he 's opposed to raising gasoline taxes			0
@entity1 said he has asked his state transportation commissioner and the head of the @entity56 agency to work with federal and regional officials to find other ways to boost commuter capacity			0
" however , any future project must recognize the regional and national scale of such an effort and work within the scope of the state 's current fiscal and economic realities , " he added			0
@entity1 had put a 30 - day hold on the project in september to re-evaluate it			2
wednesday , @entity120 spokesman @entity119 said that @entity1 and @entity14 transportation secretary @entity121 had spoken by telephone and " agreed to have staff work together to further refine the estimated cost of the entire project , and those conversations are ongoing			0
" now that the project has been killed , the @entity72 could redirect its funds to other projects across the @entity14			0
the $ 600 million already spent on the project may not be reimbursed			1
@entity0 's @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
