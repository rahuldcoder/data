-- i was walking to my study on the campus recently when i came across the annual ritual : rows of cars were being unloaded by parents bringing their kids to college			1
there was a whole beehive of young people , with special t - shirts marked " staff , " who helped the parents carry the computers , boxes , and other gear			1
a generation ago , i had to schlep that stuff myself ( with the assistance of my bewildered freshman son )			0
by the time i walked back home in the late afternoon , about half a dozen parents were lingering , chatting with each other , obviously reluctant to leave			1
they must have skipped the " letting go " event that my university , like many colleges , organizes to make the parting easier -- as one college dean put it , " to take the gas out of the helicopters			1
" a couple asked me if i was a college professor			0
they wanted to know if my colleagues and i would notify them if their kid were to get into trouble			1
they assured me that they had no special concerns about their daughter			0
however , she had just turned 18 , she had never been away from home for any long period of time , and she sometimes can be swept away by peer pressure , they allowed			0
the father also wondered whether the parents of other students would be notified if their children showed signs of mental distress , referring to this summer 's shooting by a student at a theater in @entity57 , @entity58 , and to the @entity59 in 2007			1
i reassured the couple that if i saw a student in trouble i would help , but explained that notifying parents is a surprisingly complicated matter			1
help on the campus is readily available			0
my university , like most others , has elaborate psychological counseling services , medical clinics , and , of course , a police department			0
beyond that , it has a " care network , " whose staff members " connect the dots " of information about students from a variety of sources -- including concerned fellow students , staff , and faculty -- and when need be , reach out to troubled students			0
but calling the parents of a student -- like so much in our lives -- runs into laws , regulations , and , yes , lawsuits			1
in 1974 , @entity94 passed the @entity95			0
it was enacted to protect students ' records by requiring colleges to get written permission from students to share information about them with others , parents included			1
most colleges understood the law as posing a blanket ban on notifying parents , although lawyers found some loopholes ; they argued that maybe a professor could share " personal observations			1
" the @entity113 , passed by @entity94 in 1998 , allowed colleges to share information about students under the age of 21 with their parents in certain cases , including the violation of policies regarding drugs and alcohol			1
following this amendment , many colleges started to notify parents , a change in policy that according to some research had beneficial effects			1
for instance , one study found that more than half ( 52 % ) of the colleges that increased parental notification saw a decrease in alcohol violations			2
( critics argue that the main effect of such changes was to make the students more discreet when they abused alcohol			0
) the law ( by some interpretations at least ) limits the disclosure of information to parents who pay the bill for college			2
my university , for instance , will provide some information to a parent who submits a tax return in which they list the student as a dependent , a return that has to be resubmitted each year			2
the sociologist in me holds that family bonds do not suddenly end when a youngster goes to college , that the transition from being a kid at home to an adult on one 's own should be a gradual one , and that students need their families ' support			0
colleges should nurture these bonds -- and benefit from them in promoting good conduct -- whether or not @entity176 pay			2
as one student told me : " the legal firewall between universities and parents is unnecessarily strict			1
college life is a period of growth , and the university system does not always provide adequate guidance toward that end			0
parents conintue to play a major role and should be encouraged , not dissuaded from doing so			2
those students hoping to keep their affairs secret will just have to learn better discretion , which is in itself an important life skill for those hoping to hold on to their privacy in the modern world			0
" at the same time , i realize that some families are dysfunctional , and some students may have reasons to fear that the parents will yank them out of school ( or at least stop paying ) if they get less than an a average			2
others may load students with so much guilt , or such heavy demands to respect the family legacy , that a student may yield to family pressures and major in law instead of , say , in music			2
hence , it seems that a good way to sustain family bonds while protecting students from undue pressure is to allow the students , as my university does , to indicate from @entity218 which family members should be contacted			0
these may be grandparents , older siblings , or a stepmother or father			0
families may have to hover less , but that does n't mean students ought to be out of sight			2
the family 's continued involvement is a major resource in helping students mature , even if they are no longer minors , as long as colleges also provide ways of protecting students from excessively intrusive parents			1
this is why the form that allows students to change their designated family contact is so useful			0
an assistant dean who is called in the middle of the night because a parent is concerned about @entity244 's grades , or a parent who loads a student 's e-mail with endless suggestions , should be free to work out with the student a change in the approved family contact form			1
colleges need to nurture family bonds but cut the hovering			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			1

*federal* laws limit colleges ' ability to inform parents how their children are doing
@entity257 : parents wonder about grades , how they *'ll* know if a student gets in trouble
@entity257 says policies vary , but it makes sense to keep parents informed about their kids
he says colleges should also be wary of parents who hover too much
