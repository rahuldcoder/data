-- years before @entity2 was charged with child sexual abuse , a psychologist told @entity5 police in 1998 that the former assistant football coach acted the way a pedophile might			1
in her assessment , @entity9 described her involvement in a case in which the mother of a young boy reported that @entity2 had showered with her son and may have had inappropriate contact with him			2
a redacted version of that evaluation was published saturday by @entity19			2
" my consultants agree that the incidents meet all of our definitions , based on experience and education , of a likely pedophile 's pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch , within a context of a ' loving , ' ' special ' relationship , " @entity20 wrote			1
the assessment could be significant because it suggests the university was warned about @entity2 , in no uncertain terms , as early as 1998 , but did not stop the alleged abuse			1
@entity2 , a longtime defensive coordinator for the @entity39 , is currently under house arrest as he awaits trial on more than 50 counts of child sexual abuse			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0
former school officials @entity44 and @entity46 are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation			0
in addition to @entity9 ' evaluation , @entity19 released a 1998 campus police report tied to the same sexual misconduct allegations against @entity2			1
it described a second evaluation conducted by @entity57 , identified as another psychologist			0
like @entity9 , he spoke to the child in question about what transpired between him and @entity2			0
he went into the interview cold , and reported he found no indication of child abuse			0
" @entity57 said that he had n't heard of a 52 - year - old becoming a pedophile , " the report read			0
in an e-mail to @entity0 , @entity69 , spokesman for the @entity71 attorney general , declined comment on the 1998 assessment and differing opinions			1
@entity5 rejected a @entity0 public records request for a copy of the 1998 police report in december			1
@entity79 , an assistant general counsel , asserted in a letter to @entity0 then that @entity5 is " a state - related institution " and not a " state school " like some in other states , and therefore does not have the same public records requirements as other public institutions			1
" because the 1998 investigation did not result in any criminal charges , it is not criminal history information and the university 's police are thus required by law to keep that information within the police department , " @entity79 wrote			2
according to a grand jury 's report released in early november , the mother of one of @entity2 's accusers -- identified as @entity99 -- came forward and said the coach had showered with her son and hugged him			1
two campus police detectives eavesdropped on conversations in may 1998 when the mother confronted the coach , who retired a year later from the @entity39 program			0
police later monitored a second conversation that month , in which the mother told @entity2 to stay away from her son			2
i was wrong , " @entity2 said , according to the grand jury report			2
" i wish i could get forgiveness			0
i know i wo n't get it from you			0
i wish i were dead			0
" no charges were ever filed in that instance , and local and state law enforcement authorities did not look deeper into those and other allegations against @entity2 until years later			0
@entity120 , attorney for @entity121 , released a statement soon after news of the report broke on saturday , blasting @entity5 for failing to take action			1
" why was a second opinion sought from someone with a connection to @entity2 ? why were reports of inappropriate contact between @entity2 and young boys on the @entity5 campus and @entity5 state activities consistently ignored ? " " much of the evidence coming to light points to a conspiracy of silence surrounding @entity2 's behavior at the expense of children , " he wrote			1
@entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			1

the assessment and a police report were released saturday by @entity19
@entity20 : @entity2 's behavior *displayed* " a likely pedophile 's pattern "
an attorney for an alleged *victim* suggests a " conspiracy of silence "
@entity5 *previously* *rebuffed* a @entity0 request for a copy of the 1998 report
