-- rudeness is n't contagious -- but we all may be carrying the virus			1
has rudeness become a chronic condition ? i was in the @entity7 last weekend			1
the " @entity7 , " as the conductor pithily put it , means , " no cell phones , no fun ! " twenty minutes into our blissfully silent journey , this woman behind me makes a call			2
she was speaking in @entity15 , and i sort of wanted to use her transgression as a way to test what 's left of my @entity15 skills			1
but the most primal part of me wanted to grab her phone , just as @entity22 snatched @entity24 's mic ; i wanted to threaten to shove it down her throat , just as @entity28 threatened the line judge with a tennis ball ; and i wanted to yell j'accuse ! in the same @entity33 cadence of @entity35 's bug - eyed , " you lie ! " however , self - control prevailed , so i shot @entity37 a very pointed stare			1
@entity22 's interruption , @entity28 's threat , @entity35 's outburst , @entity37 ( not so ) quiet car : does @entity43 need a time - out ? is rudeness on the rise ? @entity0 : 3 rules of civil behavior not exaaaactly			1
i 'd say our capacity for incivility is the same as ever , but what is on the rise is our ability to express and bear witness to rudeness			1
i 'm not the first to point out that @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , talk radio -- all of these give us ways to behave rudely with immediacy , scope and , often , anonymity			2
we have more means at our fingertips to react without delay : we can tweet , text , phone or e-mail our nastiness , unfiltered			2
our outlets for rudeness are on the rise , but so is our consciousness of it -- and that 's not a bad thing			1
@entity0 : is there such thing as too much communication ? that ubiquitous technology that enables us to be so rude , so quickly and thoroughly , also allows us to broadcast people 's bad behavior			1
( thanks , @entity87 ! ) the boorishness of @entity22 , @entity28 and @entity35 was immediately disseminated , deconstructed and debated			1
the public has shamed and judged them			2
( although @entity43 rep. @entity35 seems to spell his : " i 'm $ $ $ @entity93			1
" ) but i think if our best answer to rudeness is self - righteousness , we 're missing something			1
that question -- " is rudeness on the rise ? " -- implicitly suggests that we might be in the throes of an epidemic , that rudeness is contagious			1
such a diagnosis implies we 're not rude until we " catch " rudeness from someone else			1
you ca n't help catching a cold right ? and if someone 's rude to you , you ca n't help being rude back , right ? wrong			1
this notion of contagious rudeness absolves us of responsibility			2
i think of it more as a latent virus we all carry			1
gross , i know , but helpful ... and hopeful			2
you know how when you feel stressed , or run - down , or @entity122 in @entity123 forgets to sneeze into his elbow , you " happen " to get sick -- because you 're in an environment that activates a virus ? i think it 's the same with rudeness : it 's this little beast inside us that just trolls about , waiting for its opportunity			1
and when someone is rude to us , that beastie lunges out of us -- if we let it			2
what this acknowledgment of our inner rude beastie does is create a little compassion , a little space , a little " there but for the grace of @entity144 go i " when we encounter the rudeness of others			1
@entity0 : what to do when a stranger attacks like any kind of chronic condition , we have to stay on top of it			0
if only there were a rudeness alert system so we could be prepared			2
you know , like the @entity157 or the @entity158 -- @entity159 could tell you , " there 's a cold effrontery hitting your neck of the woods ! " alas , we have stay on top of our own latent rudeness			1
if we own it , watch it , then we can take some spiritual vitamin c to keep it dormant			0
we can carry with us emotional @entity171 so we 're not at the mercy of others ' bad behavior			0
remember @entity175 ? well , a gentleman pointed to a sign that read " @entity178			0
" this was more productive than my passive - aggressive stare			0
@entity37 ended her call ( something about @entity185 going to le plage and @entity187 ? i really have to bone up on my @entity15 ... ) and immediately said : " no cell phone ? i 'm sorry ... i did not know			0
" pop ! my self - righteous bubble burst			0
i was so glad i had n't been ruder , more imperious			0
she was human ; she was sorry			0
the other day , i was invited to visit a k -- 8 school in @entity193			0
purell dispensers dotted the hallway walls			0
this school was taking precautions against getting sick			0
but a sign of even more robust health ? every single kid i passed stopped , introduced him or herself , and shook my hand			0
in their classrooms , they stood up before talking to me			0
some seventh - grade boys in " @entity207 " class explained to me how when they get upset , they check their " anger barometer			0
" while this made me feel very , very old , it also filled me with hope			0
seems like they 're doing some hand and heart sanitizing			0

@entity215 : rudeness is latent virus in @entity43 waiting to erupt
*examples* : @entity22 's interruption , @entity28 's threat , rep. @entity35 's outburst
ubiquitous technology enables us to be so rude quickly and thoroughly
but *possibility* our rudeness may be disseminated , may keep us in line
