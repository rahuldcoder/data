@entity0 , @entity1 -- as oil drifted onto beaches as far east as the @entity7 , a @entity4 official said saturday the company was pleased with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the @entity12			1
@entity4 senior vice president @entity13 said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap installed on the well to a drilling ship on the ocean surface			1
" that operation has gone extremely well , " @entity13 said at an @entity21 news conference			1
" we are very pleased			2
" that 's about 31 percent of the 798,000 gallons of crude federal authorities estimate is gushing into the sea every day			2
the company 's progress was not enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline			2
@entity32 , the mayor of @entity33 , @entity21 , confronted @entity13 at the afternoon news conference for not acting promptly when reports of tar balls washing ashore surfaced			1
visibly upset , @entity32 said local officials have been asking to meet with @entity4 officials for over a month , but their requests went unanswered			1
" if you sensed our frustration , you would have been here a lot sooner , " @entity32 told @entity13			2
" people in @entity33 are starving to death now because they ca n't get out to catch the fish			2
" @entity4 engineers are hoping to increase the amount being funneled to the drilling ship but have to be careful about the pressure within the cap that was placed on the well head a few days ago , said @entity53 adm. @entity52 , the federal government 's response manager			1
@entity52 told reporters at a briefing saturday that @entity4 plans to shut valves in the cap -- which are allowing oil to escape -- once the pressure is eased			1
the ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day , still shy of the amount spewing			1
earlier , coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of @entity4 's progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil to shorelines as far east as the @entity7			1
the @entity70 predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as @entity74 , home to popular destinations in @entity76			0
@entity1 beaches remained open saturday but the number of beachgoers was down			0
@entity80 and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean			2
@entity1 gov. @entity89 walked the beach accompanied by " @entity92 " singer @entity91 , who is building a hotel on the @entity0 shoreline			0
" i saw some tar balls , " @entity89 said			0
" it 's terrible when you see something like that			0
" @entity1 sen. @entity103 , a @entity104 , demanded that @entity4 donate $ 1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five @entity106 and said that president @entity109 " needs to push them to do that			1
" " i want to see this president more engaged here on the ground , working through problems , " @entity103 said			0
the oil slick has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the @entity106			2
images of oil - drenched pelicans were all over the internet , prompting even more public anger toward @entity4			1
@entity109 sought in his weekly address saturday to ease fear along the @entity106 by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in @entity124 history			2
" it 's brutally unfair			0
it 's wrong , " @entity109 said in the address , recorded a day earlier in @entity127 , @entity128			0
" and what i told these men and women -- and what i have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that i 'm going to stand with the people of the @entity106 until they are made whole			0
" it appeared that @entity4 was making progress after capping the breached well head , @entity109 said , but he said the federal government was " prepared for the worst			1
" he cited a series of statistics that illuminated the " largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country			0
" they are as follows : 17,500 @entity152 troops authorized for deployment			0
20,000 people currently working to protect water and coastlines			0
1,900 vessels are in the @entity12 assisting in the cleanup			0
4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available , enough to stretch 1,300 miles			0
17 staging areas across @entity128 , @entity162 , @entity21 , and @entity1 to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines			1
meanwhile , the @entity70 on saturday reopened an area of the @entity12 to fishing			0
after reviewing images and data , the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles west of the @entity169 and @entity170			0
at the same time , it closed 2,275 - square miles off the @entity7 , extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of @entity174			0
that means that 32 percent of the @entity12 still remains off - limits for fishing			0
the @entity4 well erupted after an explosion and fire on the @entity182 drilling rig on april 20			1
eleven people on board died and the @entity4 - leased rig sank two days later , leaving up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil pouring into the @entity12 daily , according to federal estimates			1
@entity4 has struggled to contain the gushing oil , trying myriad methods to plug the well and divert the crude			1
thursday was the first time the @entity193 oil giant was able to report progress , when it successfully lowered a containment cap on the ruptured well			1
even if the funneling procedure is able to contain most of the oil , the solution is temporary , @entity52 said			1
the gushing well can only be killed after @entity4 completes drilling of two relief wells			1
@entity52 said the first relief well is about 7,000 feet below the ocean floor			0
@entity4 will have to go down to between 16,000 and 18,000 feet to be able to intercept the breached well			2
the long - term threat , @entity52 said , will not go away until a relief well is completed			0
@entity4 has said the earliest that will be done is august .			2

new : @entity4 official " pleased " with containment progress
new : @entity21 mayor confronts @entity4 official
@entity4 *collects* 250,000 gallons of oil in first 24 hours of funneling
@entity4 hopes to increase that amount as pressure in cap eases
