-- cruising along the @entity2 , 20 bottlenose dolphins crisscrossed the currents as my family and i toured the @entity6 of @entity7 in a slow - and - easy , 55 - foot pontoon			1
on a warm summer evening , we joined captain @entity12 's @entity11 in @entity13 , @entity7 , which is across the bridge on @entity15			1
there are three simple words that tourists are encouraged to shout once someone spots dolphins : " there they are ! " ( even the most cautious adult sightseers ca n't resist yelling when they see a dolphin skimming the surf			2
) life 's a beach at @entity28 captain @entity12 's guarantees dolphin sightings on each cruise , and the popular boat tour enterprise does n't disappoint			1
halfway through our two - hour cruise , i stopped counting after spotting about 30 playful dolphins surrounding our boat			2
" this is a very active group of dolphins today , " our guide told us			2
" we do n't know how many dolphins we 'll see each day -- but we do know we 'll find them			2
" the dolphin watch cruise -- a must - do activity for families -- leaves from a bayside dock in @entity13 , a quaint waterfront town on the eastern side of @entity15 where in the late 1800s every store lining the waterfront had a door to come ashore by boat			2
