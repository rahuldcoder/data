-- a 10 - nation group the @entity4 administration has gathered to fight @entity5 could help , but more important will be the nations that surround the @entity9 militant group 's self - declared " caliphate , " experts say			1
after meetings at last week 's @entity13 , @entity11 defense secretary @entity10 spoke of a newly formed " core coalition			1
" president @entity4 said it would take on @entity5			1
the nations are @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , in addition to the @entity11			0
@entity25 , a @entity13 member , is the only nation in that group located close to @entity5 , which is also known as @entity5 and calls itself the @entity29			1
it has taken over parts of @entity32 and @entity33			1
this month the @entity11 plans to ask the @entity35 to support a resolution aimed at cracking down on foreign fighters in @entity5 , a @entity11 official said			1
and @entity11 secretary of state @entity38 says he 'll be heading to the @entity39 on tuesday to work on building a broader coalition to defeat the @entity9 group			0
the key to winning the battle against @entity5 , analysts say , could be courting countries in the region			1
" the most important element of this coalition is the local and the regional , " said @entity48 , chairman of @entity39 studies at the @entity50			0
" the @entity11 and allies wo n't put boots on the ground			0
... the @entity32 , @entity55 , and @entity33 will basically be doing the fighting			1
" analyst : stop @entity5 ' ' social oxygen ' defeating the group known for horrific acts of terror -- seizing towns , slaughtering civilians , beheading many people including journalists -- will demand much more than military action , said @entity48			1
" the most important element is to deny isis its social oxygen			0
" @entity5 has blended in with local communities " to portray itself as defender , " he said			2
members of the persecuted @entity74 community in @entity32 told @entity0 that after @entity5 came into town , @entity76 neighbors turned on the minorities and helped isis kill			2
stopping @entity5 means convincing @entity79 -- who have felt disaffected by the @entity32 government -- that @entity5 is an enemy			2
the goal is to " drive a wedge between local @entity79 communities and @entity5 , " @entity48 said			2
to that end , @entity85 and @entity86 , which are @entity79 states , can play a critical role , @entity48 said			1
they 're home to many @entity79 , including former @entity32 military officers who fled after the @entity11 invasion in 2003			0
" i bet you @entity11 , @entity85 and @entity86 officials are working 24 hours a day to try to convince these leaders to join their alliance , and to in turn convince their counterparts to stand up against the @entity29			2
" analysts : it 's up to the @entity85 " @entity85 is the only authority in the region with the power and legitimacy to bring @entity5 down , " two analysts write in the @entity104			1
the country " effectively eradicated @entity114 in the kingdom , " write @entity109 of @entity111 's @entity110 and @entity112 of the @entity113			0
it also " has a unique form of religious credibility and legitimacy , " since @entity85 is the epicenter of @entity121			2
having @entity85 " in the lead can only add to the legitimacy of the campaign against @entity5 , " said @entity122 , a former @entity11 ambassador who is now with the @entity123			1
" the @entity76 states in this campaign must also provide military support -- involving forces , arms , training , subsidies for the tribes , intelligence , and diplomatic and even religious efforts to discredit @entity5			2
" analyst : how to bring in @entity137 these efforts could bring about an alignment between @entity85 and @entity137 in fighting the militants , said @entity141 , a political science professor at @entity142			1
" @entity39 is characterized by a welter of conflicting fault lines and interests , " he said			0
when @entity121 nations have aligned along @entity79 and @entity148 lines , @entity85 and @entity137 moved further apart , " and in fact waged a proxy war against each other			1
" now , @entity141 said , new fault lines pit radical groups against authoritarian governments threatened by them -- and on that , the two nations could come together			0
@entity157 , president of the @entity158 , believes @entity137 is even better equipped to fight @entity5 than @entity85 is			1
" the @entity137 have far more battle experience , particularly with asymmetric warfare , as well as fighting against guerrilla forces , " he said			2
but @entity162 of the @entity163 cautions against the @entity11 coordinating with @entity137			2
" some diplomats might say because the @entity11 and @entity137 have a mutual interest in seeing @entity5 defeated , we should work together			1
that 's like saying because arsonists and firefighters both have an interest in fires , they should work together , " @entity162 says			0
" @entity137 seeks not to defeat terrorism , but swap one flavor for another			2
" @entity137 's and @entity33 's regimes are close , so @entity137 involvement would create the " awkward political problem of what you do with @entity33 president @entity182 , " says @entity141			1
" this is not unlike the problem of politics generally			0
when you build coalitions , not everybody likes every policy			0
" analyst : @entity33 let @entity5 grow the dire situation reflects a success of @entity182 's regime , some analysts say			1
" the @entity33 regime , backed by @entity137 , allowed @entity5 to proliferate so that they could present the @entity11 and @entity196 with a ' devil you know ' choice " -- pushing against @entity11 calls for @entity182 's ouster amid the nation 's bloody civil war , argues @entity202 of the @entity203			1
" each of the actors in the region has some kind of responsibility for the position we are in now , " she adds			0
" ironically , each of those players , @entity137 included , is looking to the @entity11 to fight the monster they created			1
" @entity4 's " core coalition " may be torn over just what role @entity33 should play in fighting @entity5 , said @entity217 of the @entity218			1
" the @entity219 would like very much for @entity182 to fall , but @entity11 airstrikes on his most militarily significant enemy are n't going to help that end			0
so there 's going to be a lot of disagreement about what to do with that problem			0
" given @entity11 tensions with both @entity32 and @entity33 , incorporating them into a joint effort against @entity5 will be " very complicated diplomatically , " notes @entity231 of @entity232			1
" the @entity11 is extremely unlikely to cooperate directly with the @entity182 regime or @entity137 at this juncture			2
" the focus , @entity231 said , will be on working with the @entity236 -- @entity55 forces in northern @entity32 -- and with @entity32 's own security forces			0
analyst : plan for @entity240 @entity4 has repeatedly called on the @entity32 government to build an inclusive government that brings together @entity79 , @entity148 , and @entity55			0
whether the government does so will be a critical factor in determining whether the country stands up to @entity5 and other militants looking to seize power			0
it 's also important to think ahead to what happens if @entity5 is defeated , said @entity250			0
" once @entity5 is gone , what will local governance look like in these areas ? how will federal governments reassert their presence ? " while ending @entity5 ' reign of terror is an immediate concern , a long series of problems with @entity9 groups in the @entity39 and @entity259 stemmed from political vacuums in which extremists grabbed power			0
for governments to succeed after @entity5 , particularly in @entity32 , they 'll have to include people in areas freed from @entity5 ' grip			0
" if the @entity32 government remains dominated by @entity148 politicians and if @entity33 remains a failed state , " said @entity250 , " this will be impossible			0
" @entity273 : where do jihadis come from ? @entity0 's @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0
