on monday , however , the party declared that it its candidate @entity18 had won 52.5 % of the votes in the weekend presidential election , putting the party in a position to reclaim power			0
what is the @entity2 ? the @entity2 is a religious and political group founded on the belief that @entity26 is not simply a religion , but a way of life			1
it advocates a move away from secularism , and a return to the rules of the @entity34 as a basis for healthy families , communities , and states			1

what is its history ? in its early years , the group concentrated on religion , education and social services , but as its membership grew , it moved into the political sphere , organizing protests against the @entity4 government			1

the movement went underground in the 1950s , and decades of oppression by successive @entity4 rulers led many of the @entity2 's members to flee abroad , while others were jailed			2
