@entity0 , @entity1 -- long before the sun came up over the newly vertical @entity6 cruise liner , a little party was going on in @entity0 harbor			1
it was just after 4am and the team of highly specialized salvage experts , who were feeling proud about the unprecedented rotation of the massive vessel that crashed on @entity0 's shores in january 2012 , were making their way to the dock from the control room where they 'd spent the last 19 hours			1
when the @entity6 finally came to rest on the platforms 30 meters below water at exactly 4am , the salvage vessels in the harbor blew their horns in celebration -- which summoned the villagers who came to the port			1
it escaped no one that a similar scene played out 20 months earlier when the @entity6 first came to rest on the rocky shores			1
only this time , instead of carrying blankets and warm clothes for the shipwreck victims , they carried champagne bottles for the salvage crews			2
interactive : how ill - fated cruise liner was raised from @entity39 seabed captain @entity40 , the director of @entity41 , which is leading the mammoth $ 800 million operation , was standing on shore in a well - worn gray @entity41 jumpsuit , to thank his team personally			1
he looked every bit like one of the workers and not at all like the big boss coming in from @entity50			2
" we 've worked on this for the last 18 months , and our efforts paid off well , " @entity40 later told @entity2 as he sipped a celebratory beer with workers at the @entity53 on the portside			2
" it came together well			0
" @entity40 , himself a salvage master , stepped aside while the star of this particular show , @entity61 , the 52 - year - old @entity62 in charge of the @entity6 salvage , and his key team took center stage			1
and what a stage it was			0
as the team walked from the port to the @entity72 , the crowds cheered and rushed to hug them			0
many popped champagne bottles and passed them around , almost as if the home team had just won the @entity76			0
many of the salvage workers sat at the outdoor tables , just like they do after every shift and wondered just what all the fuss was about			1
" it 's just a job , " said one of the @entity85 workers			2
" i ca n't believe they are all here at this hour waiting for us			0
" in fact , the people of @entity0 see the rotation , or parbuckling , of the @entity6 liner very differently than the salvage team that pulled off the feat. for the workers , it was a risky operation that succeeded			1
but for the @entity98 , it is the first concrete step towards moving the beast from the island 's shore			1
throughout the day on monday when the @entity6 slowly rolled to vertical , the islanders watched and waited and paced up and down the port like nervous parents before a birth			1
many of them lined the hills above the wreck with binoculars and time - lapse cameras to capture the event			0
when the morning sun finally rose to show the @entity6 's twisted and bent starboard side , the horror of the wreck suddenly seemed more real than even the night it happened			1
for 20 months , the ship had been melded to its rocky underwater perch			2
when it was peeled off , it exposed a scene that looked something like a cross between an earthquake and a bomb			0
soggy curtains hung limp in the broken windows , deck chairs were imbedded into the stateroom walls			0
one lone lifeboat that had been smashed into the ship 's carcass looked as flat as a painting hanging on the wall			2
suitcases and dingy brown stained bedding were pressed up against the few windows that were still intact			0
the stateroom balconies were folded up against the ship 's outer wall , some trapping deck chairs against the cabin doors			0
islanders mingled with journalists who studied the wreckage from every possible angle exchanging binoculars and long - lens cameras to get a better view , pointing out bizarre details of a scene that literally petrified the moment the ship crashed into the rocky shore			1
it was a surreal scene , and one made even more poignant by the fact that the other half of the ship was still pristine white , almost as if the ship was wearing a half - white , half - black masquerade mask			0
there was nothing to do but stare .			0

the @entity6 ship was *righted* after a huge salvage effort off the island of @entity0
the people of @entity0 see the operation as moving the beast off their shore , writes @entity170
to the workers , it was a risky operation that succeeded , she says
