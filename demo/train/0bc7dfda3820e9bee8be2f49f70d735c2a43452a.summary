-- the entire eastern coast of the @entity4 should prepare for @entity5 , a large and dangerous hurricane churning northwestward over the tropical waters of the @entity8 , the nation 's emergency chief warned tuesday			2
at 8 p.m. et , the @entity9 said the winds in @entity5 remained unchanged from its previous update , at 90 mph , making the storm a category 1 hurricane			1
however , the reduction is expected to be only temporary , and @entity5 is still forecast to become a category 3 event , a major hurricane , by wednesday night or thursday , the center said			2
@entity5 was moving through the southern @entity19 and will pass very near or over the @entity20 and @entity21 later tuesday night , @entity0 senior meteorologist @entity18 said early tuesday evening			1
the storm could threaten the @entity24 coast on saturday and is likely to continue to be a hurricane all the way into @entity27 as it moves along or over the northeast coast , @entity18 said			1
widespread damage is possible from coastal @entity24 all the way up to the @entity32 , including the major cities of the @entity34 , @entity18 said			1
conditions continue to be favorable for @entity5 to intensify to a major hurricane , a category 3 or higher , with 110 mph winds or stronger , as it moves through the @entity19 on thursday and passes just east of @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity18 said			1
but @entity42 , the @entity43 administrator , noted that @entity5 's exact path can not be predicted this far out			2
the storm , he said , will affect a large area			0
" people think hurricanes are a @entity50 thing but people in the mid-atlantic and @entity34 need to take @entity5 seriously , " @entity42 said			1
" we have a lot of time for people to get ready but we do n't have forever			0
" @entity18 said @entity5 is expected to pass well east of @entity56 so only minimal effects are expected thursday and friday as the storm moves northward toward the @entity59			0
a landfall is possible on saturday as the storm approaches @entity24			1
as of tuesday , the most likely place for landfall appears to be on the @entity63 of @entity24 as the computer models have continued to shift the track of the storm eastward , @entity18 said			1
he added it 's possible , if this trend continues , that the dangerous core of @entity5 may miss @entity24 altogether and stay just offshore			1
beyond saturday , most of the computer models continue to show the storm very close or over coastal sections of the @entity34 , @entity18 said			1
many models and the official forecast show a hurricane landfall in the @entity34 anywhere from @entity79 to @entity80 , @entity81 , into @entity82 and the islands			1
widespread damage from wind , rain , and heavy surf appears likely as the storm moves through , he said			0
even if the storm does not make a direct hit on the @entity34 , the impact could be the same as a very intense winter nor'easter , @entity18 said			1
hurricane - force winds may occur in major cities like @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 along with widespread power outages and severe flooding affecting possibly millions of people , @entity18 said			1
while the effects of a category 3 or higher hurricane hitting the @entity63 is potentially devastating , the bigger impact with @entity5 may be on the @entity34 , which could take a direct hit from a hurricane for the first time in decades or experience a very intense storm that stays just off the coast , @entity18 said			1
emergency officials in southeastern states have already stepped up operations in preparation for the first significant storm to threaten the @entity4 in three years			0
@entity24 's coastal @entity116 on the @entity63 and surrounding @entity118 have declared a state of emergency starting at 5 a.m. wednesday			1
officials declared a mandatory evacuation for all visitors and residents starting at 5 a.m. thursday			0
" we will be ready if @entity5 reaches @entity24 , " gov. @entity124 said			1
" our teams are already lining up supplies , trucks and resources to reach anywhere the storm might touch			0
" @entity124 said at a news conference tuesday that " in @entity24 , we 're prepared			1
" " quite frankly ( the state 's ) emergency center has done this over and over and over , and we have the best system in @entity4 , we know that ... and that system is very , very robust and strong			0
" but she advised coastal residents especially to make plans and to prepare hurricane evacuation kits : " food supplies , medicine , water -- begin to think about your pets , begin to think about those things all around your home or business that can cause damage if there are high winds			2
" in @entity154 , emergency officials in @entity152 , which includes @entity153 , worked to make certain that construction sites on major highways could be cleared quickly in case evacuations of coastal areas became necessary			0
" we 're contacting ( construction crews ) every day now to make sure if we should have to do something , that they could remove their barrels and construction equipment , etc. to clear the road so we do n't have impediment in the roadways , " county @entity160 director @entity159 said tuesday evening			2
" we ... will continue to do that until this threat is passed			0
" @entity5 became a category 2 hurricane monday evening , with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph			2
the storm , moving at 10 miles per hour , is expected to strengthen to a category 3 by wednesday , which would make it a major hurricane , forecasters said , and then approach category 4 status as it gathers steam and organizes over the warm ocean			2
" we see no reason for it not to be a major hurricane , " said @entity182 , director of the @entity183 - based @entity9			2
@entity182 said @entity5 could potentially affect the unveiling of the @entity188 memorial in @entity189 and cause problems with flooding in northeastern states that have already experienced high levels of rainfall this summer			0
he said the @entity195 up to @entity196 in @entity24 is warm enough to sustain a major hurricane			1
tuesday , @entity5 took aim at the @entity20 and @entity21 after lashing the @entity199 with 100 mph winds and heavy rain			2
it is expected to reach the southeastern and central @entity19 by early wednesday			0
forecasters said @entity5 could bring another 4 to 8 inches of rain to the @entity199 and @entity204 , with as much as 15 inches in higher elevations			0
potentially dangerous flooding and mudslides were a threat , the center said			0
rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are expected in the southeastern and central @entity19 and in the @entity21 , it said			0
on @entity213 , the skies grew dark tuesday morning			0
@entity214 , the office manager at the @entity215 , said many guests had evacuated but 11 remained and were planning to ride out the storm in the hotel			0
with memories still fresh of @entity221 , a monster 2008 hurricane , residents were taking no chances , @entity214 said			2
the streets were empty and windows boarded up			0
in @entity228 , the storm left widespread damage and about 600,000 of the island 's 1 million electricity customers were without power , gov. @entity226 said monday			0
nearly 800 people were in shelters , but no injuries had been reported			0
president @entity236 signed an emergency declaration for @entity228 , which will allow for federal disaster assistance to the @entity4 commonwealth			0
@entity0 ireporter @entity240 captured images of dark clouds in @entity244 as strong winds whipped against his microphone			1
" i have been prepared since the start of the hurricane season with plenty of water , food , flashlights , candles and of course all my camera and video equipment , " he wrote to @entity0			1
@entity0 's @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			2
