@entity0 , @entity1 -- islamic militants have moved fighters to the @entity7 border town of @entity8 in an effort to combat @entity1 forces who have entered @entity7 , the militant group @entity3 said tuesday			1
the group said it viewed the @entity1 forces crossing of the joint border as " an affront to @entity7 's territorial sovereignty			1
" this move of fighters , which started monday , comes after the militant group had threatened to " come into @entity1 " if @entity1 forces did not leave @entity7			1
" @entity1 troops have entered 100 kilometers into @entity7 , and their planes are bombarding and killing residents , " @entity18 , spokesman for @entity3 , said in an online message posted on a jihadist website this week			1
" we shall come into @entity1 if you do not go back			2
" in response , the @entity1 and @entity7 governments issued a joint communique declaring @entity3 " a common enemy to both countries			1
" they pledged to work together to stabilize @entity7 and cooperate in security and military operations			2
@entity1 forces crossed into @entity7 to pursue @entity3 fighters after the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in @entity1 heightened tensions in @entity38			1
@entity1 invoked the @entity40 charter allowing military action in self - defense against its largely lawless neighbor			2
the abductions are part of a " recent spate of blatant attacks " that are part of " a changed strategy by @entity3 calculated to terrorize civilians , " the communique said			1
" if you are attacked by an enemy , you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try ( to ) hit wherever that enemy is , " said @entity1 defense minister @entity52 in a news conference that aired sunday on @entity2 affiliate @entity54			2
@entity3 , which is linked to @entity60 , has been fighting to impose its interpretation of @entity63 law , or sharia , on @entity7			1
the group issued a statement tuesday , however , denying responsibility for the abductions			0
" these are mere suppositions unfounded in any solid evidence , " the statement said			0
" @entity1 authorities have been seeking justification for an aggressive incursion on to @entity7 territory			1
" on september 11 , armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where @entity79 @entity78 and @entity80 , both in their 50s , were staying			0
@entity80 was shot dead while trying to resist the attack			0
his wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat , and is believed to have been taken into @entity7			2
on october 1 , pirates made another cross-border raid , this time snatching a @entity88 woman in her 60s from a holiday home on @entity91 where she lived part of the year			0
earlier this month , gunmen abducted two @entity95 workers from the medical charity @entity96 from the @entity98 refugee complex , about 80 kilometers ( about 50 miles ) from the @entity7 border			0
@entity1 announced its new tactics days after @entity102 forces claimed victory against @entity3 in the @entity7 capital of @entity105			1
the military said last week it had taken the remaining @entity3 strongholds in the far northeast of the city			0
" the challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week , as they attempt to rebuild their lives , " said lt. col. @entity110 , spokesman for the @entity111			0
he was referring to a suicide truck bombing in @entity105 this month that left dozens dead			0
other @entity3 attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians			0
@entity124 and @entity102 forces have battled @entity3 in the impoverished and chaotic nation for years			0
many analysts believe the military push has severely affected @entity3 , along with targeted strikes against organization members and the weakening of @entity60			1
@entity3 said in august it was withdrawing from @entity105 , and @entity7 's @entity132 , backed by @entity102 peacekeepers , now controls most districts of the capital , the @entity40 office has said			2
however , the group still poses a threat , @entity110 has said .			0
