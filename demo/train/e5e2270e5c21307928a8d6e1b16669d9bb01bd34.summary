@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been nine months since i took the photos , but as the temperature drops below zero at the start of another @entity1 winter , one image stubbornly dwells on my mind			1
it 's not of the tsunami - inflicted destruction -- the flattened homes , mangled cars or piles of debris -- in @entity0 , one of the worst - hit areas in the @entity19 , in the country 's north			1
instead , it is an image of retirees huddled on small benches outside their temporary homes			1
the pre-assembled homes have ample heating and are equipped with small kitchens -- and yes , many people in other parts of the world live with much less			1
but in talking with some of the elderly residents in march , one year after the devastating earthquake and tsunami , it was clear that they were struggling to adapt to their new surroundings			1
now as a second winter arrives after march 2011 quake , i was curious as to how these people were coping and i wondered what their thoughts were on @entity1 's upcoming general election			0
did they have a strong preference on who should become @entity1 's seventh prime minster in just over six years ? or , with so much political change and their own upheaval , were they even paying any attention ? i was also compelled by the fact that , according to government figures , more than 320,000 people remain in temporary housing across the affected region			1
and it could be the case for quite some time			0
according to a recent report in the @entity63 newspaper , of the nearly 24,000 housing units set to be constructed in three prefectures , only roughly 13,700 will be completed by march of 2015			0
that 's four years after the tsunami hit			1
and with this all in mind , it 's particularly tough for many people in the @entity19 to grasp the concept of the revolving door of leaders , as they watch the reconstruction drag on			2
@entity76 , a resident at one housing center , told us , " nothing has changed here , but the prime minister has changed many times			2
i do n't understand the meaning of any of it			2
" sixty - seven - year - old @entity84 lost his wife in the tsunami			2
he used to run a small restaurant in @entity0			1
now it 's a simple food truck			0
he is even more outspoken , saying " the government has n't done a thing for us			1
they 've only cleared the debris			1
" @entity94 erected a sign it what was once a neighborhood that reads @entity98 , or " try your hardest , " in the hope of inspiring those who are struggling in the aftermath of the tsunami			1
he says , " i know it was a huge disaster and things would take time			0
the reaction has been too slow for too long			0
we are working hard and trying to move forward , but there are many people who are really struggling and need some help			2
" the people in the housing complexes are making the best of their situation though			0
one we visited outside @entity0 had setup a small sunday morning market the day we visited			1
they were also operating a basic convenience store			0
and we also met @entity119 at the complex 's barber shop			0
" another prime minster and another new cabinet , the reconstruction will be delayed again , " he sighs			2
but the barber shop 's owner , @entity125 , tried to keep things in perspective			0
" i sometimes wish i 'd wake , and it was all a dream , " he says			0
" but it happened to us , so we make the best of situation , and try to get back to the life we once had			0

elderly residents in @entity0 are struggling to adapt to *post-tsunami* surroundings
some live in temporary homes , *18* months after the earthquake and tsunami
one resident fears that another change in government will delay reconstruction work
another says : " the government has n't done a thing for us . they 've only cleared the debris "
