patience patience is the key to a good client - trainer relationship , says celebrity trainer @entity47			1
trainers should understand that what works for one client may not work for another			1
he or she should do an assessment of your body when you first meet to familiarize themselves with your needs			0
trainers should also find a comfortable pace for their clients , @entity47 says			1
some clients may progress at a faster rate , while others may require more coaching and assistance			2
" i love teaching and the journey of helping people find their bodies again , " she says			0
communication your trainer likely will not be with you at all times during your workouts			2

" ( @entity12 ) went above and beyond , " says @entity1			0
" when i first started the new plan , we spent half the day at the grocery store buying healthy foods because i 'm not a smart shopper			0
" @entity1 says since @entity12 told him what to eat and why , he has been able to shop and work out on his own			0
and communication goes two ways			0
" if a client always cancels on me and pushes back workouts , it makes me feel like they are n't committed , " @entity12 says			2
professionalism while it 's important to maintain a close relationship with a client , @entity47 says , there also needs to be a level of professionalism			1
