as far as hurricanes go , @entity0 is not particularly intense			1
with peak winds at 90 mph monday at 5 p.m. , it is still classified as a @entity4 , with only a small chance of briefly achieving the low end of category two before making landfall somewhere in @entity9 on monday evening			0
and yet , state and local governments have gone into full alert mode , with schools closed , cities shut down , and evacuations ordered across the @entity16			0
justifying the alarm are enormous waves arriving onshore , raising the mean water level by a few feet even here in @entity21 , where the winds are blowing directly offshore			0
@entity0 could bring ' catastrophe , ' affect 60 million @entity0 represents the confluence of a modestly strong hurricane coming up from the @entity26 and a fairly strong but not unusual continental weather system -- what meteorologists call a " trough " or " dip " in the jet stream -- that has been traversing the country over the last few days			1
in the vast majority of cases , these weather systems weaken hurricanes while at the same time pushing them quickly out to sea			2
such weather systems also generate their own cyclones , not as intense as hurricanes , but larger and slower moving			2
opinion : as @entity0 descends , tips from @entity46 survivors when these extra-tropical cyclones form over the ocean and move along the coast , we call them nor'easters ( for the strong northeasterly winds they generate )			1
sometimes , tropical and extra-tropical systems merge , and the hurricane turns into a large ocean cyclone			0
but again , almost all of these storms move quickly out to sea			0
there are two elements that make @entity0 very unusual , possibly even " super			1
" @entity62 is its pathway			0
rather than racing out to sea like most coastal storms , @entity0 has already turned hard to the left and it will make landfall at nearly a right angle to the @entity71 coastline			1
this extremely unusual track ( from right to left ) means that almost every piece of coastline from @entity9 to @entity76 will receive onshore winds at some point during the event			2
second , the core of @entity0 -- the part that will look and feel like a hurricane -- has remained intact , even as cooler and drier air from the @entity71 wraps around it			1
thus , @entity0 has each of the worst features of both kinds of storm : a small core of hurricane - force winds around its center , and a broad expanse of gale - force winds extending hundreds of miles outward that will batter the shorelines for several days			1
why did this happen ? it was simply a matter of positioning			0
@entity0 arrived east of @entity101 at exactly the right time and place to get the maximum benefits from its interaction with the dip in the jet stream			1
as a result , @entity0 became large enough to influence that system as well , and the two will wrap around each other into a single , deep cyclone , 800 miles across , extending from the ground to 40,000 feet in the sky			2
this will add to the duration of the event as the circulation takes several days to wind down over @entity120 and @entity121			0
opinion : climate change raises stakes for coast as for whether @entity0 is a " superstorm , " perhaps we should refrain from such a designation until after the event			2
there was already a " superstorm " in march 1993 -- a nor'easter that dumped snow from @entity134 to @entity135			0
there was the @entity137 of 1991 -- later known as the @entity137 -- which , like @entity0 , also grew from the confluence of a large extra-tropical cyclone and a hurricane ( which , unlike @entity0 , was destroyed in the process )			1
and there was the blizzard of ' 78 , the @entity144 of 1996 , and others			0
@entity0 will take its place in history , but we will not know what that place is until many days have passed .			1

@entity152 : as far as hurricanes go , the storm we call " @entity0 " is not very intense
@entity152 : there are two elements that make @entity0 unusual , possibly even " super "
he says @entity0 **'s** right - to - left pathway is *atypical* , as is its intact hurricane core
@entity152 : @entity0 will take its place in history , but we *'ll* have to wait until it **'s** over to know where
