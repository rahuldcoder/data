-- the family of @entity3 @entity2 had a message wednesday for the notorious leader of the terror group @entity6 , asking him to answer for the sin he committed with the beheading of the journalist			1
@entity2 's family broke its silence the same day @entity3 intelligence officials said the videotaped execution was authentic			1
" i have a message for @entity20 , " family spokesman @entity15 told reporters in @entity17 , reading from a statement			2
" where is your mercy ? " " wayluk , " @entity15 said , using an @entity17 phrase that roughly translates to committing a great sin			2
the statement went on to cite passages from the @entity28 , asking @entity29 why he violated the tenets			2
" i am here debating you with kindness			0
i do n't have a sword in my hand , and i am ready for your answer , " according to the statement read by @entity36			0
in @entity37 , @entity15 told reporters gathered outside the @entity2 family 's home in @entity41 : " today , we grieve			1
this week , we mourn			0
but we will emerge from this ordeal ... we will not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapons they possess , fear			1
" ' we will not forget ' the statement came just hours after president @entity49 said the @entity3 will not be intimidated by the killers of two @entity3 journalists			1
" those who make the mistake of harming @entity3 will learn that we will not forget ... that our reach is long and that justice will be served , " @entity49 said during a news conference in @entity53 , where he was meeting with leaders of the @entity56 nations			1
the killing is the second beheading of an @entity3 journalist in two weeks , and the militant group said it 's a result of @entity49 's decision to conduct airstrikes in @entity68 against @entity6 , which calls itself the @entity69			1
the goal of the @entity3 is to " degrade and destroy " the capabilities of @entity6 in @entity68 and @entity73 , " it 's not contain , " defense secretary @entity70 told @entity0 's @entity74			1
" it makes you sick to your stomach , but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world , " @entity75 said			0
" ... it wo n't just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it			0
" journalists most at risk @entity75 : options on the table all options -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- are on the table to address the threat posed by @entity6 , @entity75 said			1
those options include possible airstrikes in @entity73 , where @entity6 has established a stronghold in and around the northeastern city of @entity101			1
but there is a question of just how long it will take to defeat @entity6			1
" this , as the president has said , is going to have to be a sustained effort			2
and it 's going to take time , and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat , " deputy national security adviser @entity108 told @entity0 's @entity109			1
vice president @entity114 added his own voice to the calls for justice , saying the @entity3 will pursue the killers " to the gates of hell			1
" " as a nation , we are united , and when people harm @entity3 , we do n't retreat , we do n't forget , " he said at an appearance near @entity121 , @entity122			2
" we take care of those who are grieving			0
and when that 's finished , they should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice , because hell is where they will reside			0
@entity137 is where they will reside			0
" the video the video of @entity2 's execution was posted online tuesday			1
in a scene eerily similar to an earlier video of the death of @entity3 journalist @entity146 , @entity2 kneels in the desert , dressed in an orange prison - style jumpsuit			1
a masked " executioner " lords over him , wielding a knife			0
" i 'm back , @entity49 , and i 'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the @entity69 , " the executioner says			0
" just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			0
" the executioner appears to be the same person , and the location of the two killings appears to be similar , probably in or around @entity101 , one of the safest areas for @entity6 , said @entity165 , a professor at @entity166			2
" it is almost the exact same choreography , " @entity165 said			0
the journalist speaks ; the executioner speaks			2
then the victim is beheaded			0
in the video released tuesday , a @entity172 hostage is shown after the beheading of @entity2 , just as @entity2 was shown in @entity146 's video			1
@entity172 rescue attempt the @entity172 said it attempted to rescue one of its citizens held by @entity6 " some time ago " but failed			1
@entity172 foreign secretary @entity180 provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works			2
" you would n't expect me to discuss various options that we will be considering , " he said			0
" but i can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person			0
" @entity172 echoed the same sentiment as @entity49			0
" this country will never give into terrorism ... a country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers , " prime minister @entity192 said			0
this summer , several dozen of the most elite @entity3 commandos flew into @entity73 but could n't find the hostages , including @entity2 and @entity146 , a @entity3 official told @entity0 last month			1
' degrade and destroy ' speaking wednesday , @entity49 addressed his much - criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on @entity6			1
he said he was referring to a military strategy in @entity73 that " might " require congressional approval			0
" our objective is clear			0
that is to degrade and destroy ( @entity6 ) so it 's no longer a threat , " he said			1
" we can accomplish that			0
it 's going to take some time , it 's going to take some effort			2
" @entity49 said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group			2
" we 've been putting together a strategy that was designed to do a number of things			0
... what we have to make sure is we have a regional strategy in place , " he said			0
how will @entity49 respond to @entity6 ? remembering @entity2 maps : where do jihadis come from ? @entity0 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .			1

effort to defeat @entity6 will take time and go beyond this administration , official says
