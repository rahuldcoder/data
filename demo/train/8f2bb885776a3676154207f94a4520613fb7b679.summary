-- prince @entity1 may be head of state in the principality of @entity3 , but when it comes to the @entity7 street circuit of @entity8 there is only one king : @entity10			1
the @entity12 driver won a record six times at the legendary grand prix during a glittering career which included three world championship triumphs and 41 race victories			1
" as a competitor , from the point of view of all or nothing , he ranks up there at the top , " fellow world champion and former on - track rival @entity19 told @entity0			1
" sadly , as with so many other drivers in the history of the sport , he was prematurely taken away from us			0
" @entity3 : where exhaust fumes and foie gras mix @entity10 's tragic death aged 34 at the @entity34 in 1994 devastated millions in his homeland , and his passing led to three days of national mourning			1
@entity39 's narrow twists and turns are regarded as one of motorsport 's toughest tests , but @entity10 seemed to relish the technical challenge and excelled when pushing his car to the absolute limit around the harbor 's winding streets			2
he began his love affair with the track in 1984 , with a dazzling display of driving talent during his rookie season with @entity56 team @entity54			1
@entity10 qualified 13th for a grand prix blighted by torrential rain in an unspectacular car			0
it was only his sixth race and one which would mark the first step on his ascent into @entity7 's pantheon of greats			1
@entity10 's greatest @entity7 moments " winning the wet races , as @entity10 did , is all part of the challenge , " current @entity68 driver and 2008 world champion @entity67 told @entity56 newspaper @entity70 in 2008			1
" he proved he was the best by destroying everyone ... doing it ( at @entity3 ) is even harder			0
this track does bring out the true driver and the best drivers do rise to the top			0
" if what @entity67 said is true , then the legendary circuit unearthed its most precious jewel among the monsoon - like conditions of june 3 , 1984			2
the downpour was laying waste to a distinguished field , with @entity89 , already a double world champion , and @entity91 both out of proceedings inside the first 15 laps			2
after @entity10 unleashed a ruthless surge of speed to burn past future championship winner @entity97 and move into second place , the 24 - year - old had @entity68 's race leader @entity100 in his sights			1
with @entity10 tearing through the deluge and gaining on the @entity104 at a rate of three seconds per lap , the race officials came to @entity100 's rescue			2
the contest was brought to a premature end after 31 laps , seconds before @entity10 was able to overhaul @entity110 , and it heralded the beginning of a fierce rivalry between the two future teammates			0
despite an explosive start to his @entity3 career , it would be another three years until @entity10 secured his maiden victory on the street circuit while racing for @entity119 in 1987			1
the @entity121 's mastery of @entity8 's winding roads was coming to the fore , and the full extent of his ability was displayed during the 1988 event -- in his debut season as @entity100 's colleague at @entity68 , when he won his first world title			1
" managing two highly - motivated sportsmen such as @entity10 and @entity100 was always going to be a challenging task , " former team principal @entity130 told @entity0			2
" one of @entity10 's unique and great qualities was that he was determined , he wanted to be the best and nothing was about to stand in his way			1
" it was @entity10 's infatuation with supremacy which contributed to a legendary qualifying performance , with the sport 's official website claiming he " became a passenger on a surreal ride into the unknown			1
" despite driving identical cars , @entity10 was able to record a lap two seconds faster than his @entity104 teammate to clinch pole position in mesmeric fashion			2
" @entity10 had such an evident natural talent , " said @entity130 , who is now executive chairman of the @entity151			0
" he was physically fit to a level that caught so many of his opponents off - guard			0
" he had an admirable obsession with being the best , a superiority for which he was both known and loved			0
" @entity158 seemed a formality for @entity10 , who had built a 55 - second lead over @entity100 with only 11 laps remaining			2
determined to push himself harder and harder , the race leader lost control and smashed into the wall at the eighth turn on the track -- a corner known as @entity169			0
" i think it is always surprising , " @entity19 , who also crashed out that year , told @entity0 of @entity10 's failure to win in ' 88			1
" but at @entity3 the slightest mistake can turn into a big mistake , and @entity10 made a very small mistake and paid the penalty of not finishing			2
" it gifted prost a fourth @entity3 triumph in five years , but @entity10 would bounce back to emphatically trump his nemesis			1
in 1989 , aged 29 , he secured a second @entity8 crown and began a sequence of domination which saw him claim five successive editions of the marquee race			0
arguably his toughest -- and most fortuitous -- win came in 1992 , when the @entity185 of @entity19 had claimed maximum points in the year 's first five races and was blazing a trail towards world championship glory			0
" with @entity89 , @entity100 and @entity10 , as well as myself and many other drivers , it was very difficult in the late 1980s/early 1990s to win , " @entity19 said			0
" with competition being at its strongest , and having so many other committed drivers , it was a very satisfying experience when you beat them			0
" @entity19 was on course to once again defeat his rivals until disaster struck with seven laps remaining , when the world championship leader was forced into the pits			0
@entity10 took control but , on fresh , quicker tires and with a superior car , @entity19 quickly closed the gap on the new leader and furiously tried to overhaul him			0
a dogged @entity10 used every inch of his @entity68 to defend the @entity185 ' onslaught and he held on to temporarily derail @entity19 's championship charge			0
@entity19 was exhausted when he took to the podium , but the 31 - time race winner is not bitter when reflecting on the experience			1
" incredible excitement combined with disappointment , " said @entity19 when asked what emotions he experienced 23 years ago			0
" the rules then made it incredibly exciting , and i think the last closing laps were fantastic for the fans and for @entity7			0
" so what was it that made @entity10 a seemingly perfect match for @entity3 ? " at times @entity10 had a better team , a better car and reliability , which is all you need at @entity3 , " said @entity19			1
" but above all you have to have that total commitment and concentration to do the job			0
any great race - car driver will tell you that driving a car on a knife edge is sometimes very difficult			0
" two weeks after @entity10 's passing at @entity238 , @entity236 's @entity235 assumed the mantel of @entity8 maestro by claiming the first of his five victories on the @entity244 coast			1
the @entity245 can match @entity10 's all - time record by guiding his mercedes over the line in first position at this weekend 's race but -- at the age of 42 -- the seven - time world champion 's best days are certainly behind him			1
@entity10 's @entity8 achievements look set to be beyond even @entity7 's most successful driver			1
proof , if it was needed , that the @entity12 remains the king of @entity3 .			2

@entity10 won @entity7 's @entity3 a record six times
the @entity12 was second on his debut on the track in 1984 , with the @entity54 team
@entity10 's first win on the street circuit arrived in 1987 , his final season with @entity119
