@entity0 -- diversity is not a word that describes the @entity5 's makeup over most of its existence			1
only three women justices have served ( the first in 1981 ) , and only two african - americans ( the first in 1967 )			1
the first @entity11 was named last year , but no @entity12 or asian - americans have been named , nor have any openly homosexual or disabled justices			1
only about 11 @entity15 have served , and seven @entity16			0
the expected elevation of @entity18 to the high court would represent both a step forward and a retreat of sorts , for bench diversity on the high - profile court , especially when compared to the man she would replace			1
@entity18 is set to become the third woman on the current court , a move applauded by retired justice @entity30 and former first lady @entity32			1
the 50 - year - old also has no judicial experience , unlike every current member of the court , who were previously federal appeals court judges			1
justice @entity38 , for one , likes that			0
" currently , there is nobody on the court who has not served as a judge -- indeed , as a federal judge -- all nine of us , " he said last month in a speech			2
" i am happy to see that this latest nominee is not a federal judge -- and not a judge at all			0
" she would be the third @entity52 , joining justices @entity53 and @entity55			1
the other six members of the court are all @entity58 : chief justice @entity59 , and justices @entity38 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64			1
retiring justice @entity65 is the current court 's lone @entity66			2
that has prompted divergent views from the religious and political community on whether diversity of faith matters			0
his departure and replacement by @entity18 also would represent a loss of diversity on two other fronts : geography and education			2
the @entity83 native is a true @entity84 in his friendly personality and his approach to deciding many legal issues			0
@entity18 would help form an unusual majority : five natives of the @entity91 area			2
@entity38 is from @entity92 , @entity53 still retains her @entity94 accent , @entity64 grew up in the @entity95 and loves the @entity96 , and @entity63 called @entity97 , @entity98 , home			1
the nominee herself was raised in the upper west side of @entity102			0
only @entity103 among the boroughs would be unrepresented on the high court			1
and then there is the academic equation , with the new court to be composed entirely of @entity110 law graduates			2
@entity18 went to @entity111 , just like @entity59 , @entity38 , @entity61 and @entity55			1
that 's another majority @entity18 can boast			2
@entity53 also attended the @entity114 - area school , as well as @entity115			1
the three other justices went to @entity117			2
only @entity65 -- again -- stayed out of those ivied schools , graduating from @entity119 at the head of his class in 1947			0
@entity65 ' departure is a generational shift , too : he is the court 's last military veteran who came of age during the depression , served in the @entity127 during @entity128 , and began practicing law during the @entity130			2
with the advent in the 1920s of open @entity134 hearings of court nominees , public and press scrutiny of court diversity have become important talking points			0
at that time , tremendous social and political changes in the country were reflected in a slow push to diversify the court 's makeup			0
since then , seats unofficially have been set aside for individuals of certain backgrounds			0
the first @entity16 justice was @entity148 , whose bitter 1916 confirmation was marked by underlying anti-semitism			0
when @entity152 joined him in 1932 , a so - called @entity16 seat was established			0
@entity152 was replaced by @entity153 , who was replaced by @entity154 , who was replaced by @entity155			0
currently , two @entity16 justices sit on the bench , @entity53 and @entity55			1
a similar precedent was created when @entity159 became the first person of color to sit on the court			0
when he retired , @entity62 took @entity159 's seat , although president @entity164 considered a wide variety of candidates before settling on the @entity168 native			0
@entity62 has acknowledged to colleagues that he benefited to some extent from having the right connections in his career			0
many political and legal experts expected @entity174 to make his first court pick a @entity11 , but his two picks were white males			1
some court observers believe political pressure to choose a justice strictly on gender or race is no longer relevant			0
" the whole commentary of the court has evolved away from that , " said @entity184 winning author and court historian @entity183			0
" our society has changed ; the novelty no longer exists			0
" president @entity193 's two high court choices have been applauded by many advocacy groups for the diversity they brought to the court , but criticism also has arisen on some fronts			1
civil rights groups expressed disappointment the nation 's first black president did not seriously consider naming any african - americans to the court			1
" the nomination of @entity64 certainly was historic in that she became the first @entity11 to sit on the high court , and it was embraced by civil rights groups , " wrote @entity1 political analyst @entity206 in may			1
" yet this time , for highly qualified @entity211 female judges , such as @entity212 , the retired chief justice of the @entity168 @entity5 , to never make the cut for a face - to - face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders i 've talked with over the last several days			1
" @entity18 in fact has been criticized for the lack of diversity she brought as @entity111 's law dean from 2003 - 09			1
@entity223 , founding director of the @entity224 , looked at @entity18 's hiring record , noting of the 29 positions she had a chance to fill , 28 were of those appointed were white and one was @entity230			1
and of the group , only six were women -- five white and one @entity230			2
" these numbers on the surface are appalling , and would be ripped to shreds by those who value diversity , " @entity206 said			0
@entity18 's defenders say her hiring power was limited , but she did help bring a number of conservative professors to the faculty , earning praise from many on the right .			2

no @entity12 , @entity230 , homosexual or disabled justices named to high court
@entity11 , @entity64 , named last year
@entity18 would become third woman on @entity5
would join fellow *jewish* - americans @entity53 , @entity55
