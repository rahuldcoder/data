the mother of @entity1 -- an @entity2 journalist beheaded by @entity4 militants -- said she is " embarrassed and appalled " by how the @entity2 government dealt with her son 's case , telling @entity8 that officials even suggested family members could be charged if they raised ransom to free him			1
" i think our efforts to get @entity17 freed were an annoyance " to the @entity2 government , @entity13 told @entity8 's @entity14 in an interview that aired thursday			1
" it did n't seem to be in ( @entity2 ) strategic interest , if you will			2
" officials told @entity1 family members " not go to the media , " and that the " government would not exchange prisoners , " or carry out " military action " to try to rescue her son , according to @entity13			1
" @entity17 was killed in the most horrific way			0
he was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination , lack of communication , lack of prioritization , " @entity13 said			0
" as a family , we had to find our way through this on our own			2
" she added that the family was told many times that raising ransom " was illegal ( and ) we might be prosecuted			1
" " we were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow , miraculously , " @entity1 's mother told @entity8			1
" and he was n't , was he ? " in fact , video posted online on august 19 showed @entity1 kneeling next to a man dressed in black , with @entity1 reading a presumably scripted message that his " real killer " is @entity2 , then being summarily executed			1
@entity4 -- the @entity49 extremist group that 's taken over large swaths of @entity51 and @entity52 in its quest to create a far - reaching caliphate under its strict version of @entity57 law -- took credit for @entity1 's beheading , saying it was in response to @entity2 airstrikes in @entity52 and threatening more killings			1
' our government needs to be ... willing to negotiate ' more than three weeks later , @entity2 president @entity64 named @entity1 as he outlined his strategy for fighting @entity4 and described the terrorist group 's brutality			1
" they enslave , rape , and force women into marriage			0
they threatened a religious minority with genocide			0
in acts of barbarism , they took the lives of two @entity2 journalists -- @entity81 and @entity82 , " @entity64 said in a televised address wednesday night			1
as she watched the speech , @entity13 said one thing was going through her mind			0
" this whole strategy to eliminate @entity4 and the terror threat is important , obviously , so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them , and to engage in force			0
but that only caused @entity17 's death , " she said			2
" i guess all i 'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder , smarter , willing to negotiate with these people who hate us , so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror			1
" video shows @entity4 beheading @entity1 ' he was compelled to bear witness ' after her son 's death , @entity13 wrote on the free james foley facebook page that " we have never been prouder of our son @entity17			1
he gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the @entity51 people			0
" sometimes , she said thursday , it was tough for his family to deal with his decisions to report in dangerous parts of the world			0
" at times , even his siblings were angered that he would return after his captivity in @entity120			2
i mean , it was hard as a family to understand , because @entity17 was so loved ... and we were selfish			2
we wanted him with us			0
we wanted him safe , " she said			0
" but @entity17 was not			0
@entity17 was selfless , and he had the courage and the compassion			0
... he was compelled to bear witness			2
" to this end , his family launched a foundation -- the @entity130 -- aimed at helping families of @entity2 hostages , supporting @entity2 journalists in war zones and helping urban youth in educational endeavors			2
the organization is one way the @entity1 family is trying to honor @entity1 ' past and do something positive in the future			2
but none of it takes away @entity13 's disappointment that more was n't done -- especially by the @entity2 government -- to secure his release , somehow , since his november 22 , 2012 , disappearance in northwest @entity51			1
at the time he was working for @entity2 - based online news outlet @entity149			2
" @entity17 would have been saddened " by the @entity2 government 's efforts in the years after his abduction , his mother told @entity8			1
" @entity17 believed , till the end , that his country would come to ( his ) aid			0
" a failed rescue operation upon hearing these comments , @entity2 national security adviser @entity161 -- after praising the @entity1 family for doing " an amazing job ... to try to bring @entity17 home safely " -- said she " and others in the @entity2 government worked very hard with @entity13 and her family to try to be supportive , to try to provide what information we could			1
" @entity167 also pointed out " hundreds of @entity2 personnel " were involved in a " very daring and very well - executed rescue operation " to free @entity1 and other captives , after getting what they hoped was " actionable intelligence " about the location of the hostages			1
@entity177 spokesman rear adm. @entity176 has said elite @entity2 commandos undertook this mission this summer inside @entity51			2
official : @entity2 commandos tried , failed to rescue hostages " unfortunately , they were no longer there , " @entity167 , a former @entity2 ambassador to the @entity182 , told @entity8			1
" but i think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring @entity2 in captivity back home			1
" @entity13 , though , said the rescue operation came " very late			0
" " their location was known for more than a year , " she said			0
during her son 's time in captivity , she said , it often seemed the family knew more about his whereabouts than the authorities			1
" i did all i could , " she said			0
" i was unable to do enough			0
" lessons for the future now , @entity13 says she thinks @entity201 should change its approach to cases like that of her son and @entity82 , another @entity2 journalist beheaded by @entity4 weeks after @entity1			1
" i pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made , " she told @entity8 , " and to acknowledge that there are better ways for @entity2 citizens to be treated			1
" there should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups , she said			0
" the risk is becoming higher and higher , " she said , " and i really feel that our country let @entity17 down			0
" @entity64 escalates campaign against @entity4			0

@entity81 's mother says the @entity2 must find a way to negotiate with terrorists
she *criticizes* the @entity2 government over its actions since son 's 2012 disappearance
@entity1 kin " told ... many times " they might be charged for raising ransom , his mother says
@entity238 adds : " we were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow , miraculously "
