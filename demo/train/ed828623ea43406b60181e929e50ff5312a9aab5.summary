pope @entity0 created 19 new cardinals saturday in a ceremony in the @entity4 's @entity3 -- the first such appointments since he was elected pontiff last march			1
the new cardinals come from countries around the world , hailing from as far afield as @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			2
the pope presented them with the traditional biretta , or red cap , and ring at a formal ceremony called a public consistory			1
the scarlet color of the cap symbolizes the cardinals ' willingness to die for their faith			2
looking frail , @entity25 , the @entity27 @entity26 , lined up with the existing cardinals for the ceremony in the historic church			1
when last year he became the first pope in almost six centuries to stand down , @entity25 said he would live a life of seclusion and study			1
his presence in @entity3 alongside that of @entity0 and the cardinals who will one day vote for his successor is a highly unusual event			1
@entity0 spoke sixteen of the new cardinals are under the age of 80 , making them eligible to elect a new pope when the time comes , according to @entity47			1
three of them are over age 80 and " are chosen for their distinguished service " to the @entity4 and the @entity54 , it said			1
one of those is 98 - year - old archbishop @entity56 , who was the secretary of pope @entity57			0
he was not present for the ceremony , but will be presented with his biretta in the coming days			2
two of the newly appointed cardinals already hold top @entity63 positions -- archbishop @entity64 is its secretary of state , while archbishop @entity66 is head of the church 's chief doctrinal office , the @entity69			0
no @entity70 were named among the new members of the college of cardinals , but there is one @entity75 , @entity77 archbishop @entity76			0
@entity0 : not a promotion in a letter sent last month to the chosen clergy , @entity0 gave some words of advice about remaining humble			0
becoming a cardinal " does not signify a promotion , an honor nor a decoration : it is simply a service that demands a broader vision and a bigger heart , " he said			0
" and , although it seems a paradox , this ability to look further and love more universally with greater intensity can be acquired only by following the way of the lord : the way of lowliness and of humility , taking the form of a servant			0
" commenting last month on the clergy named by @entity0 , @entity4 spokesman father @entity100 highlighted the geographical range and diversity of the countries they come from			0
" the choice of cardinals of @entity11 and @entity13 shows concern for people struck by poverty , " he is quoted as saying by @entity47 .			0
