instead , as today 's charges show , he acted with others to support terrorists to further acts of murder , kidnapping and maiming , " @entity39 attorney @entity49 said			1
" but for law enforcement intervention , these defendants would have continued to transfer funds to @entity9 to finance the @entity9 @entity8 , including its purchase of guns			2
" the charges were the result of a three - and - a - half - year investigation , and federal authorities became suspicious by the number of financial transactions between the @entity39 and @entity9 , authorities said			2

authorities said their investigation focused on the mosque leadership			2

the elder @entity17 also built a madrassa in @entity9 's @entity96 that provided shelter for the terrorist group , the indictment states			1
" the main defendant @entity17 operated and controlled a madrassa to shelter members of the @entity9 @entity8 and to train children to become military fighters for the mujahideen , " @entity49 said			2
he said authorities are aware of several unindicted co-conspirators in the @entity39 and @entity9			2
" you can purchase in @entity9 a gun for as little as $ 10			0
he had money coming from all sources , " @entity49 said			0

" @entity115 , president of the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity4 , said his worshippers were shocked by the news			0

@entity129 is arabic for mosque			0
he added that the mosque has received threats , prompting a police car to be stationed in the parking lot			0
@entity134 , executive director of @entity4 's @entity135 , told @entity1 that he is concerned about possible fears the charges might stir in the community , even though authorities emphasized their investigation had nothing to do with @entity124 or the mosques themselves			0
" the teaching of @entity124 in any way shape or form does not financially support terrorism , " @entity134 said			1
" these allegations would be completely against @entity124			0
" he said he has been to the two mosques in question and that he 's listened to the imams at the services			0

those fighters attack targets in @entity9 and across the border in @entity173			0
the group , which is headquartered in @entity175 , is different from the @entity173 @entity8 , which has been focused on re-establishing the @entity176 in @entity173			0
both groups swear allegiance to @entity8 leader @entity180 and have close ties to @entity182 , he said			0
