-- @entity2 hair , piercings and the name @entity5 -- @entity7 father @entity6 saw his own teenage daughter as he read about a different @entity5 's harrowing experience with synthetic marijuana			1
@entity11 had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter			0
but reading about @entity15 , a @entity17 high school student left brain - damaged after smoking " potpourri " she bought at a convenience store , really put him in her parents ' shoes			1
" i felt horrible for her			0
i know we all do stupid things as kids , but to have an outcome like this is dreadful , " said @entity6 , one of the thousands of readers who took the time to comment on the @entity0 story			2
" i am a sucker for my little girl , so i know how i would feel in their place			0
" @entity15 's tale set off warning bells for parents across the country : what is this drug ? why did n't her family keep her from smoking it ? what should i tell my kids ? what if that were my daughter ? the teenager 's symptoms of psychosis and strokes would jolt just about any parent into a conversation about the dangers of synthetic marijuana			1
add in the statistics about the drug 's popularity -- one in every nine @entity64 high school seniors has admitted to smoking fake weed , according to a 2011 study -- and parents were alarmed			1
opinion : regulate fake pot , it 's not going away while parents like @entity11 sympathized with the @entity73 , others said it would never happen to their kid			1
" the story points to another example of people who should n't be allowed to be parents , " wrote @entity76 , who added she was thankful @entity5 is recovering			1
she said her six children understand that using weed is unacceptable and they would face consequences if they smoked it			2
" parents need to start being parents instead of friends			2
to do otherwise results in these kind of stories or worse			0
" on the other side of the debate were parents who might allow their children to smoke real marijuana if that would keep them from experiencing @entity5 's fate			1
one dad argued for its legalization and suggested monitoring children while they try pot. " honestly , if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot , or even just try it , i 'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home , in a safe environment , just to make sure they 're responsible , " commenter @entity101 wrote			0
" i think that 's the responsible thing to do			2
you 're being a parent , and monitoring your kid , making sure they do n't do anything dumb			0
" synthetic marijuana just as dangerous @entity5 's stepfather , @entity119 , welcomed the conversation because he wants to raise awareness of the drug , even if some of the comments were n't so kind			1
" i do n't wish this upon anybody , " he said			0
" my purpose is not to judge myself or judge others , but to get @entity5 well and help others learn from our mistakes , because obviously we did make a mistake , and i 'll be the first to admit it			0
" while @entity119 knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting , he said he 's just thankful to have more time with his daughter			2
" i think back to all the fond memories i have of her , then i realize that somehow , i got another chance to make more , " he said on wednesday			0
" and these new memories may actually impact others in a positive way ... i am thankful			0
