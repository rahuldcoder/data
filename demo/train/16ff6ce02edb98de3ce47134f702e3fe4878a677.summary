-- men do n't have " guilty pleasures			1
" we own , nay , celebrate what 's bad for us			1
our obsessions are points of pride , not shame			1
some men feel no shame in gobbling three slices of pizza at once if they want to			1
you 'll never see a guy wolf down a small mountain of waffles with a side of bacon and squeal , " oh my gosh , i ca n't believe i ate everything ! i 'm so ashamed			1
" we will shamelessly sit in a nest of pizza crusts playing video games for endless hours			1
unabashed tears will crawl out of the corners of eyes when the hometown team chokes at the last minute			1
beer will be quaffed , their caloric potency mocked			1
these are the things that make life worth living			2
feeling bad about feeling good , even if the good is short - term , is for puritan chumps			2
if i could , i 'd go out everywhere in my sweat pants			2
of course , overindulging has its prices			2
sloth and gluttony are venial sins for a reason			2
but the whole idea of " guilty pleasures " is something that is lady - specific			1
women feel shame over even tiny little hedonistic infractions			1
i dated a woman once who was very much my type -- hot nerd -- who was deeply embarrassed over her celebrity trash magazine addiction			2
she actually tried to hide her @entity55 's from prying , judgmental eyes			2
eventually , i staged an intervention that went a little like this : " please , woman , own your love of snickering over pictures of @entity64 stretch marks ! " this is not to say men are n't susceptible to social pressures , and masculine stereotypes			1
there are things that , while not " guilty pleasures , " are ... minor vices			1
things we are into that contradict standard male operating procedure			1
after all , one can not live on bacon and beer alone			2
but a lot of guys find themselves infatuated with hobbies , media , and creature comforts that do n't really fit the lumberjack mold			0
i 'll wager many ladies are the quiet guardians of their man 's not - really - secret , but not - really - public , quirks			0
i am not ashamed of anything			0
this is why i will admit to the following minor vices , and in the process , teach women that they can be loud and proud when it comes to the hours spent rehearsing pucker faces in front of the mirror			1
boldly rock your " guilty pleasures			1
" bubble baths anyone got a problem with that ? i love bath salts , bubbles , fizzy stuff that promises to magically transform your bathtub into a sauna			0
the whole kit and caboodle			0
there is nothing i love more than a good , frou - frou soak			0
@entity113 , maybe i 'll light a votive candle too			0
quiche i ate it this past weekend , in fact			0
i shoveled @entity120 egg pie into my mouth			0
yes , quiche , a food that sounds like an inappropriate bodily sound			0
it had spinach in it , and i washed it down with sparkling water			0
sure , i could have eaten something drenched in cheese , or deep - fried			0
but the moment called for something sensible , delicate , and ... flaky , okay ? quiche is awesome			0
reality tv shows about shallow women a recent minor vice has actually entered my life			0
every tuesday , i eat @entity141 food and watch " @entity142 of @entity143			1
" have you seen this show ? it 's like an open invitation to hate on women			0
is this really popular female wish fulfillment ? all that chattering , and glittering ? they are a bunch of bedazzled banshees that suddenly make me understand why the @entity120 guillotined all the rich aristocrats ! sigh			0
while i 'm not overly susceptible to gender norms , i think i need to go to the comic book store , or hit the shooting range			0
see you next week , my beloved " @entity142			1
