-- recently , the @entity1 has seen a resurgence of bordetella pertussis , a highly contagious bacterial disease more commonly known as " whooping cough			0
" the disease mostly afflicts children , though adults can catch it , too			0
whooping cough is easily prevented with vaccination			1
according to the @entity14 , vaccination , introduced in the 1940s , brought the number of cases per year down from 107,473 in 1922 to just 1,248 in 1981			2
since 1982 , however , the number of cases has steadily increased			0
in recent years , there has been a general decline in vaccination to prevent many childhood diseases in the @entity1			1
in 2012 , the number of whooping cough cases in the @entity1 hit a long - time high of 48,277			0
the decline in vaccination is in part due to the rise of the anti-vaccine movement , which has found spokespeople in celebrities like @entity32 and politicians like @entity34 and @entity35			1
it is a movement that relies on scientific fraud and pseudoscience			1
in the not too distant past , one of the scientific community 's primary concerns was preventing scientific fraud			1
episodes like the 1998 fabrication of data indicating a connection between childhood vaccines and autism risk have clear public health and policy repercussions			1
claiming a link between vaccines and autism opens the door for false claims about the dangers of other vaccines , allowing , for example , politicians like @entity34 to inflame the public 's doubts about the benefits of vaccination against the human papillomavirus , or @entity65			1
in a 2011 interview on the " today " show , @entity34 mentioned a woman whose daughter suffered from " mental retardation " as a result of receiving the hpv vaccination			2
in a subsequent interview , @entity34 defended her position , fueling the anti-vaccination movement			2
given that @entity65 can result in cancer , disseminating this kind of misinformation not based on scientific evidence is dangerous			2
the general public thinks of scientific journals as unimpeachable , but the rise of e-commerce and e-media has created an unprecedented opportunity for charlatans to inflate credentials and corrupt scientific publications			1
in this process , pseudoscience has become rampant			2
in a recent article , " who 's afraid of @entity99 ? " published in @entity100 , the flagship journal of @entity92 , @entity93 revealed that it is relatively easy to publish fake scientific data in open - access journals			1
unfortunately , @entity102 's piece barely received any attention from the popular media , squandering a vital opportunity to alert and inform the general public how to differentiate the wheat of real science from the chaff of pseudoscience			1
for the sake of public health , this issue must move beyond the confines of academia			2
the ideal behind open access journals is admirable : they aim to disseminate important scientific findings to audiences such as those in nonacademic settings or residing in developing countries who may not be have access to such information			2
but , the financial reality of open access is that the business model -- where an author agrees to pay a fee , often in the ballpark of $ 2,000 , to get the article accepted for publication -- favors quantity and moneymaking over integrity			0
such publications often fail to differentiate between the plastic @entity139 and the real one			2
it is somewhat unnerving to read some of the comments posted below @entity102 's article , where a number of readers think " scientific counterfeits " are a fact of life , that falsifying data is old news , and that scientists should focus on our scientific work instead of worrying about counterfeiting			1
scientists sometimes think it is not their role or responsibility to engage in public discourse regarding their work			0
in this instance , however , they could not be more wrong			0
as scientists , we have a responsibility to speak up about the damage that pseudoscience could inflict on society			0
for example , we are in the third decade of the @entity167 pandemic , and there are still well - trained scientists such as @entity170 , once an hiv / aids control and prevention adviser to the former president of @entity174 , who denies that @entity171 causes @entity167			0
@entity175 says that recreational drugs are the culprits for @entity167 among homosexual men in the @entity179 , while the cases in @entity174 are largely due to malnutrition and other diseases			1
people like @entity175 are not shy about spreading their half - baked , unproven ideas in spite of overwhelming contradictory scientific evidence			0
in this new business environment , publishers are often no longer responsible for preventing fake or less than credible data			0
meanwhile , some scientists who have the financial resources might opt for a quick and easy publication , though their findings may be questionable			0
a key scientific currency , peer - reviewed publication , is being corrupted outright by the unscrupulous pursuit of profit			0
sadly , the profit motive has begun to play an increasingly distortive role in the dissemination of scientific research findings			0
what 's at stake here ? lives , obviously			0
less dramatic , but no less important is the question of how we define " knowledge , " and how much we can trust science and scientists			1
reasonable people can disagree on how to interpret data , but first , we need good data			0
the longer we turn a blind eye to scientific fraud , the more we encourage a pay - to - play system that puts dollars before scientific data , and the more we will erode the public 's trust in science and its authority			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity226 : there 's been a decline in vaccination to prevent childhood diseases
@entity224 : it 's partly due to the rise of anti-vaccine movement that relies on scientific fraud
he says the rise of e-media allows charlatans to corrupt scientific publications
@entity224 : pseudoscience *undermines* public 's trust in science and scientific authority
