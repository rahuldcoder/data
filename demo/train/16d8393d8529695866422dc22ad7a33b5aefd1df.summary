@entity0 -- the @entity2 endorsed @entity3 @entity4 rep. @entity3 on friday , just six years after it backed @entity3 's opponent @entity6 sen. @entity5 for the position			1
" @entity8 is hardly functioning these days			2
it ca n't pass legislation that is controversial and it often ca n't even pass legislation on which there is broad agreement			0
its reputation is abysmal , and even its members rarely dispute the popular indictment , " the editorial board said in a statement			0
" it needs fresh leadership , energy and ideas , and @entity3 can help provide them in the @entity23			1
" the surprising decision could give @entity3 the significant edge he needs to pull ahead of @entity5 in the closely contested race			1
just last week , a @entity29 / @entity28 poll found @entity3 six percentage points ahead of @entity5			1
@entity31 rules the race a " toss up			0
" @entity5 is starting to trail his @entity34 opponent , two polls say earlier this week , both candidates argued over immigration , foreign policy , reproductive rights , and the @entity40 outbreak			0
the board sided with @entity3 , saying that his ideas largely reflect @entity44 's interests , especially in the next two years			2
" @entity3 has sound ideas on tax reform that could help the economy take off and has expressed willingness to compromise on immigration despite a fairly hard line over the years			2
and his stance on defense spending appears closer to those of rep. @entity54 , who favors restraint , than to those in the @entity34 who view the military as sacrosanct , " the statement said			0
yet the @entity2 went defensive against @entity3 's conservative opinions on same - sex marriage and abortion rights			1
his position on the controversial issues did n't deter their endorsement , saying that the issues will likely be irrelevant soon since the @entity65 is establishing an acceptable norm			0
will same - sex marriage become a 2014 issue ? the editorial board called @entity5 " a fine man with good intentions " and admitted that their views align closer with him than @entity3			2
however , they say that @entity5 has not been a prominent fighter on current issues , suggesting that @entity3 's growing leadership in the @entity4 " would very likely match " @entity6 sen. @entity76 's influence in the upper chamber			1
they did praise @entity5 for being an active member of the @entity83 , particularly when he spoke out against the government for spying on the public			0
the @entity2 endorsed president @entity86 in 2012 and 2008 , but did not make any specific mentions against his policies as a reason for supporting @entity3			1
@entity86 lines go straight into @entity34 attack ads for @entity23			0
