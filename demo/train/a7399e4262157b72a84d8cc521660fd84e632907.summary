-- the @entity1 is back in the spotlight -- and not everybody is happy about it			1
despite the well of affection for the late @entity1 , his " return " in the form of a hologram at sunday night 's @entity10 did n't meet with unanimous approval			1
the spectral @entity1 performed " @entity17 , " one of the singles from " @entity14 , " a new album of posthumously released @entity1 music			1
he was accompanied by actual , physically present dancers			2
@entity10 : @entity1 hologram and @entity22 's flub get buzz it was either the most amazing thing ever -- or super creepy , depending on which side of the fence you were viewing it from			1
recording artist @entity28 tweeted " @entity1 @entity29 is rad			1
" @entity32 's vulture assistant editor @entity31 tweeted " turns out this michael jackson hologram is just as confusing and uncomfortable as we imagined			2
" twitter user @entity35 seemed to fall in the middle , tweeting " that @entity1 hologram kind of scared me ... it was cool			1
" @entity42 deemed it " scarier than the ' @entity47 ' video " while @entity44 called it " stunning			0
" ' digital formaldehyde ' though the @entity1 hologram was new , the debate over whether or not deceased celebs should be brought back is not			1
the @entity10 " performance " also resurrected the discussion on whether fans even want to see their favorite artists as holograms			2
in 2012 a hologram of the late rapper @entity58 stunned audiences at the @entity61 music festival			2
@entity62 and @entity63 have also been reanimated , after a fashion			0
the technology bringing @entity58 , @entity62 back to life at the time , @entity68 writer @entity67 argued that dead stars should be allowed to rest in peace			0
" the technology is undeniably impressive , " @entity67 wrote in 2012			0
" but @entity58 is not a fictional character , owned by a studio , but a real - life human being			0
his work may be owned and licensed , but not his entire being			0
it is impossible to know how he 'd have felt about being on that stage			0
" @entity78 with the @entity79 wondered if this latest venture into digitally bringing artists back is the mark of more to come			0
" the @entity1 hologram raises some questions : is this where we 're headed ? " she wrote			1
" @entity89 after @entity90 is gone ( or perhaps , as with @entity1 's hologram , not that long ) , can we expect to see the @entity92 performing ' holiday ' in a @entity94 tribute , suspended in digital formaldehyde , just the way she was in 1983 ? and if so , what good are music videos ? " the technology seems to have gotten even better			1
as one person tweeted ( we hope jokingly ) , " i am very scared why is @entity1 alive			1
" the performance had the full support of the @entity1 family estate			2
according to @entity10 , brother " @entity105 started to tear up as he recalled watching ' @entity106 ' in the audience at the @entity108			0
" " when he started walking and dancing , i was teary - eyed , " @entity10 reported him as saying			0
" it 's hard to please @entity1 's fans and @entity1 ... i 'm telling you it 's amazing			1
" weathering criticism the performance was supposed to be a tightly held secret for the annual awards show , but that fell apart thanks to a lawsuit meant to stop it			0
according to the @entity124 , companies @entity122 and @entity125 had filed suit against the show to stop the bit , claiming the show was using their technology without permission			0
@entity122 acquired patent rights from @entity125 for projection / staging technology after @entity135 , the company which created the @entity58 hologram , filed for bankruptcy			2
@entity138 - winning @entity135 had produced special effects for several films , including " x-men : @entity142 " and " @entity143			0
" a judge ruled that @entity10 could use the @entity1 hologram			1
the @entity79 's @entity78 did n't find the technology to be all that precise			0
" the effect was quite realistic , though at times just jerky enough that @entity1 's hologram more closely resembled his representation in the @entity152 game ' @entity1 : the experience ' than the man himself			1
in fact , it was actually slightly less realistic than the @entity58 hologram that appeared at @entity61 in 2012 ( which was actually a projection , not a hologram ) , but the response was a little different			2
" complaints in social media ranged from points about the hologram 's youthful appearance ( @entity1 was 50 at the time of his death in 2009 ) to the thought that the digital representation 's mouth appeared to be " lip - syncing			1
" one fan was forgiving , however			0
" it 's okay , " sloth queen tweeted			0
" i forgive everyone for not making a perfect hologram i understand and accept @entity1 was too perfect to recreate			1

a hologram of @entity1 gets mixed reaction
some fans found it too realistic
