@entity0 -- female drivers in @entity3 are few and far between , but one woman aiming to change this is @entity6			1
the 29 - year - old is a development driver for @entity8 , where she works with engineers in a simulator and on track tests			1
she is about to compete in her seventh @entity13 racing car season for @entity14			1
she tells @entity1 about her journey so far			1
beginnings : i grew up in the west of @entity18			1
my dad had a motorbike dealership and my mother met my father when she went to buy her first bike			1
i have an older brother and we got little karts			1
that 's how it all started			1
it was never about him wanting to beat his little sister			1
he 's a film director and he 's just been commissioned to make a documentary on my job in @entity3			1
when i was 13 , the engineer that ran me in karts took me to a @entity39 race at @entity40			1
a very young @entity41 ended up winning that day and that 's when i said to myself ' okay : this is what i want to do when i 'm older			1
' i went to @entity45 to study international business but gave it up after two years to follow my dream			1
big break : the @entity51 award is a very prestigious award in @entity53 and i was the first ever female to make the final six			1
that got me noticed by @entity14			1
i joined their @entity57 touring car ( @entity13 ) program as a factory driver			1
( @entity62 founder ) @entity61 was always very interested in the fact that one of his board members ( @entity6 's husband , @entity66 ) had a wife who raced			1
two years ago he visited and was interested to see what i could do			1
i 'd had opportunities to be in a @entity3 car but only as a publicity stunt -- three laps , end of story			2
now , they are giving me the chance to be a development driver -- not just a one year deal , a proper chance to show what i can do			1

i drive up to 280km/h			2
the hardest thing is the g - force on your body under braking and the high speed cornering			2
i do a lot of back and stomach exercises and for the braking i need to have quite strong legs as well			2
some drivers are very aggressive			1
i 'm a smooth driver			1
i have very little movement on the steering wheel , which is why i 'm sometimes better at conserving my tires than my teammates			2
drivers try to stay as slim as they can and that 's where i have a massive advantage -- i 'm 20 to 30 kg less than the guys			1
blazing a trail : i do n't race to prove how good women can be against men			2
i race because i love racing			2
do n't get me wrong , i see these little girls all dressed in pink with @entity6 t - shirts on , and that 's fantastic			1
many girls who are really interested in motorsport watch @entity3 and see no females there , so maybe they do n't understand what they could do			2
i appreciate that i can have a positive influence in some kind of way			2
but i feel i still have a lot more to achieve before i can turn around and say i did something special , as a female in a man 's world			1
bikinis : it 's a very fine line : i 'm representing a car manufacturer and all the sponsors so of course you have to make an effort to look nice at the racetrack			2
on the other hand , you have these promo girls walking around in tiny bikinis			2
i have a lot of respect for them , because i could never walk in a paddock of men in a bikini			0
everyone does what they can and what they 're good at			0
see also : new wave of activists challenge notions of beauty role models : my role models are my mother and grandmother			0
they never said to me , ' you 're doing something unusual			0
' i do n't think my mother 's ever watched the start of any of my races -- she gets nervous because that 's when big accidents can happen -- but she 's very supportive			0
my grandmother was incredibly strong			0
when my grandfather was 39 , he ended up paralyzed from the waist down in a diving accident			0
she cared for him until she died last year			0
they never had any outside help			0
she devoted herself to him and i think she had an incredible strength			0
hardest lesson : in 2005 , i could n't get enough sponsorship to do @entity39			0
i broke my ankle , so i missed some races			0
i was trying to get a drive in with @entity178 and got dropped by them at the last minute			0
i phoned my dad and said ' i 've been dropped -- what am i going to do now ? ' as i put down the phone , it rang and it was @entity14			0
one week later i had a contract			0
it was quite a journey to get to where i am today and that was a point when i thought it was all going to fall apart			0
sometimes there 's not a lot of people around who believe in you , but you must always be willing to strive for your goals and never give up , even when things get really tough			0

if you wake up every morning and are motivated and ambitious to achieve your goals , that gives you the best feeling in life			0
that brings you a happiness you ca n't get from anything else			0
relaxation : i like to just chill out with my husband and go for nice dinners			0
i 'm not a great cook and i hate the thought of spending an hour in the kitchen to make dinner , then spend 10 minutes eating and then tidy it all up again			0
game face : my family say when they see me on a race weekend , i 'm a different person			0
i 'm more focused on what i 'm doing			0
away from the racetrack , i 'm a normal wife .			0
