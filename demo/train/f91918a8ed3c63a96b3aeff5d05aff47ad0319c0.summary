@entity1 's version of what happened when he confronted @entity3 has expanded since he gave his first recorded interview to detectives , but the key parts have stayed largely the same			1
witnesses corroborated and disputed what @entity1 said about events leading up to the police officer 's fatal shooting of the unarmed teenager in @entity13 , @entity14 , on august 9			1
much of the crime scene evidence supports @entity1 's story , but there are also some key differences , according to an analysis of available material			1
@entity1 spent 31 minutes being interviewed by police the day after the shooting , about four hours in front of the grand jury , and another 45 minutes talking to @entity25 of @entity26			1
the police interview was largely procedural -- what happened when -- while his answers to the grand jury got more into description and motives			1
to @entity26 , he added a few key points and revised an unfavorable view of the @entity13 neighborhood where he shot and killed @entity3			1
the police interview from the day after the shooting and the grand jury testimony were released as part of court records for a case that was closed on monday when the grand jury decided there was no probable cause to indict @entity1 in @entity3 's death			1
there were other interviews with law enforcement -- on the day of the shooting to local detectives and weeks later to the @entity52 -- that have not been released			1
@entity1 's story always starts the same way			1
it had been a quiet shift when he responded to a 911 call to help a sick baby			2
medical staff arrived to treat the infant and as he was heading back to his police car on @entity62 , he heard a call of a theft in progress , with a description of what he said was a black male in a black t - shirt			2
he called out on the radio to the other officers involved , " do you guys need me ? " but got no response			2
black t - shirt , cigarillos the black t - shirt that @entity1 mentioned in both his police and grand jury interviews was key			1
after @entity3 reacted so strongly to @entity1 's instruction to walk on the sidewalk , @entity1 said he took a good look at him and saw he was carrying cigarillos , the item that had been reported to have been stolen just minutes earlier			1
@entity1 then looked in his mirror at @entity3 's friend @entity85 and when he saw he was wearing a black t - shirt , he put two and two together			1
" that 's when it clicked for me because i now saw the cigarillos			0
i looked in my mirror , did a double - check that @entity85 was wearing a black shirt -- these are the two from the stealing , " he told the grand jury , echoing his police interview			1
the call logs from the @entity13 police dispatch -- also released as part of the grand jury records -- do show that a " stealing in progress " was reported by the dispatcher			1
but the suspect was mentioned as being a black male in a white shirt who took a whole box of @entity107 brand cigarillos			0
minutes later , an officer came on the radio with more of a description -- one that pretty closely matched @entity3 that day : " he 's with another male			0
he 's got a red @entity116 hat , white t - shirt , yellow socks , and khaki short			0
" we do n't know if there was any separate alert about a man in a black t - shirt			0
the struggle at the car @entity1 said the identification of @entity85 and @entity3 as suspects was what led him to reverse his car back to the pair			2
to the grand jury , he elaborated that he angled his car " to kind of cut them off , kind to keep them somewhat contained			1
" that 's when the confrontation with @entity3 began -- the slamming of the car door , the fight as @entity1 was inside the car , a shot fired , then another			2
@entity3 's blood and skin tissue inside the car , a close - range gunshot wound to the base of his right thumb , and two bullet casings found near @entity1 's car support at least that there was a struggle over @entity1 's gun			2
@entity1 told the detectives how he ran through in his mind what he could do -- mace , baton , flashlight -- before going for his gun			1
to the grand jury , he expanded , describing a " use of force " triangle as to what reaction was appropriate			1
to the grand jury , @entity1 also described his fear			1
he told jurors @entity3 was so powerful that when he grabbed the 18 - year - old 's forearm , " i felt like a 5 - year - old holding onto @entity170			2
" he also used that analogy to @entity26			2
later , he told @entity25 that he was also asking himself how the situation could have escalated so quickly			2
crime scene evidence shows he lost his baseball cap at the car , then first his left sandal and then his right as he ran down @entity62			1
@entity1 did n't address with the detectives why he got out of the car			1
to the grand jury , he said he had lost his " comfort zone " in the car			1
" i wanted to be out of the car , that way if i need to run i can run , " he said			0
he continued : " but i also did n't want him to run away , so i need to kind of stay where i can keep him there , keep myself safe and wait for someone to get there			0
" @entity26 's @entity25 also asked why he got out and @entity1 agreed it was his duty			1
" that 's what we were trained to do , " he said			0
what shell casings show , and what they do n't @entity1 also told @entity26 he ran through a mental checklist to determine whether he had the legal right to shoot @entity3 and decided that he did			1
it 's impossible to tell from the 10 shell casings found farther down the road exactly how many shots were fired and when , or where @entity3 and @entity1 were in relation to each other			2
but some of the casings were found farther from the car than @entity3 's body , suggesting that the men did head some distance east before @entity3 turned and headed west again , with @entity1 backing up			2
the autopsy showed no bullets hit @entity3 's back			0
the fatal shot hit @entity3 in the head from a downward direction as he bent down or was falling			0
@entity1 said @entity3 fell on his face after the fatal shot			2
he added that @entity3 had been moving with such momentum that his feet came up into the air before coming to rest on the ground			0
abrasions were noted by the county and family - hired pathologists , and the family - hired pathologist concluded " the most likely cause " for the wounds would be that @entity3 lost consciousness and his face would have been unprotected when he hit the roadway			0
where were @entity3 's hands ? to both detectives and grand jurors , @entity1 said that as @entity3 charged at him , @entity3 balled his left hand into a fist and put his right hand in the waistband of his shorts			1
that hand stayed in the waistband throughout the encounter , he said			0
he told the @entity245 detectives : " during his first stride , he took his right hand put it under his shirt and into his waistband			2
and i ordered him to stop and get on the ground again			0
he did n't ; i fired , a , multiple shots			0
after i fired the multiple shots i paused for a second , yelled at him to get on the ground again , he was still in the same state			0
still charging , hands still in his waistband , had n't slowed down			0
i fired another set of shots			0
same thing , still running at me , had n't slowed down , hands still in his waistband			0
" when @entity3 was 8 to 10 feet away , @entity1 fired at his head -- the fatal shot			2
and @entity1 said the arm had not moved			2
" when he went down his hand was still under his , his right hand was still under his body looked like it was still in his waistband			0
i never touched him , " he told detectives			1
the investigator from the @entity268 sent to the crime scene took no photographs , telling the grand jury later that the battery in his camera had died			1
and @entity274 could find no photographs of the body in the materials released by the prosecuting attorney			0
but the medical investigator did describe how the body was lying			0
one arm was indeed near @entity3 's waist			0
but it was the left , not the right			0
" the deceased was lying in the prone position			0
his right arm was extended away from his side			0
his left arm was next to his side his lower arm was beneath his abdomen and his hand was near the waistband of his shorts			0
" @entity1 used his interview with @entity26 to revise what he 'd said about @entity13 and the @entity298 area			1
while he told the grand jury it was a " hostile environment " and " anti-police , " he told @entity25 he was sad about the riots that hit @entity3 's @entity13 neighborhood after the grand jury decision was revealed			1
" that community is really a great community			0
" and while he stood by all his actions , @entity1 added one more sentiment in the @entity26 interview that he had n't been asked about by the detectives or in the grand jury -- remorse			1
" everyone feels remorse when a life is lost			0
... i never wanted to take anybody 's life , " he said .			0

three interviews with @entity1 are now *public*
his story followed the same lines when told to detectives , the grand jury and @entity26
