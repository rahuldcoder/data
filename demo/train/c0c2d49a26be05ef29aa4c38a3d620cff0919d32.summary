-- irony is a part of life , the @entity1 goes			0
and right now , president @entity5 is living the part , in a big way : he 's the civil libertarian defending an activist drone program			1
he 's the liberal with a spy agency caught eavesdropping on the private conversations of friendly leaders			1
and he 's the high - tech health care reformer whose website got stuck at @entity16			1
and so the ultimate irony may be this -- a president who extols the virtues of government has now been sucked into the big government vortex , experiencing ( up close and personal , as they say ) what it feels like to lose control to the bureaucrats			1
the ones who are afraid to deliver bad news , not to mention those who do n't deliver the news at all			2
( as in , " the website crashed			2
" ) and the surveillance chiefs who , um , did n't initially volunteer that they 're spying on the private phone lines of @entity38 's best friends			1
maybe the president needs to figure out some new communications tools to make himself clear			2
( as in , " @entity42 's cell is not just another data point			0
" ) @entity5 , we 're told , is frustrated and angered by the pathetic rollout of his signature legislative achievement			1
he 's also clearly re-examining how the @entity47 decides to target friendly leaders , what we get from it and why we need it at all			1
a couple of ex-intelligence officials tell me they 're not shocked gambling was going on in @entity57			0
( " our job is to know things , " says one			0
) whether the president should have known about the monitoring of these specific heads of state is another matter entirely -- and best left to intelligence aficionados			2
i 've asked -- and gotten answers on both sides of the argument			0
but here are the larger questions that play into both the website fiasco and the @entity47 issues : how can a president take control of his own government ? how can he make sure he knows what he needs to know ? and as the pro-government cheerleader , does n't he have a special responsibility to make sure it delivers , especially when his legacy hangs in the balance ? the problem is it 's never easy to untangle a bureaucratic mess			1
" so you 're the president , you 're angry and you want to know how all of this happened , " says a former senior administration official			2
" and the truth is , even you may not be able to figure it out			0
you just wo n't have enough time left in office			2
" stunning as that sounds , it 's probably accurate			0
presidents are often isolated , and always the first among equals			0
so it seems to me that especially in the @entity101 one of the principal jobs of an executive is to understand the incentive subordinates have to conceal information selectively			1
people may report facts and then spin them			0
bad news is not a good thing to deliver to presidents			0
some are protective of the office and the president ; giving the president plausible deniability of any problem is often the easiest and safest route			2
or , as one former @entity101 hand told me , " people just do n't want to upset the boss , or get him blamed for anything			1
" all of which a president should know going into the @entity122			2
if the reason the president did not know about the epic website issues is because the problems were hidden from the ground up , how about this solution : establish an atmosphere , at all levels , in which truth telling is rewarded , not punished			1
if @entity5 was surprised at the rollout of the @entity134 , then on some level he failed one of the principal tests : get the truth out of people , even if they know you are not going to like it			1
yes , this is government and humans are humans			2
but @entity134 has been the signature legislative achievement of this presidency			1
everyone knew how complex this would be to get going , at every level			0
so here 's a question : why was n't the a-team led out of the @entity101 , with a daily update to the president ? @entity5 the campaigner was incomparably good at establishing metrics and using information technology to assess the extent to which those metrics were being hit			1
what happened here ? what seems to have happened was what often happens : the work got delegated to the bureaucrats somewhere else -- @entity163 ? @entity165 ? -- and , as a result , it got bogged down , delayed and muddled			0
mistakes went either hidden or unrecognized			0
if folks down the food chain knew , they were keeping it from their bosses			0
after all , no reward in telling the truth			0
the big question now is whether these problems are evidence of a huge management failure			0
" one of the things you find after working in government is that , under tremendous pressure , organizations that are supposed to produce accurate information , often do n't , " says a former senior administration official ( think @entity180 )			1
" and you can only rely on what people are telling you			0
" or not telling you , as in the case of @entity42 's cell phone			0
if the president and senior officials were not told about the wide range of the program , who thought that secrecy was a good idea ? does a president have to play a game of @entity201 with his own people to figure things out ? or , conversely , as some intelligence officials claim , if the president did know something -- some giblet -- why not more ? it 's not as if @entity5 is a passive examiner of intelligence ; quite the contrary			1
so what gives here ? consider this : you 're president @entity5			1
you believe in the affirmative use of government			2
you 're trying to govern a country that has lost confidence in the ability of that government to execute anything			0
and now you discover the website of your prized legislative achievement is a disaster			0
and the spies were tapping a good ally 's cell phone , for no immediately obvious reason			0
the final irony may be this : four out of five @entity38 have little or no trust in their government to do anything right			1
and now @entity5 probably feels the same way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 says president @entity5 has been a believer in high - tech government
she says the @entity134 website woes and @entity47 spy practices have to shake his faith
@entity237 : should n't @entity101 have taken control of the signature health care initiative ?
president may now be among 80 *%* of @entity38 with little faith in government , she says
