on wednesday , the @entity0 issued an opinion in the matter of @entity3 v. @entity4 , holding that it is not illegal to secretly photograph underneath a person 's skirt on the subway , a practice widely known as " upskirting			2
" the court , and the justice who wrote the opinion , have since weathered harsh -- and undeserved -- criticism			1
on thursday , state lawmakers passed a bill banning upskirting , but that new law — which yet to be signed by the governor -- will still be subject to the same judicial scrutiny if it fails to adequately define the crime and the elements thereof			2
no one , including the members of the @entity0 , condones upskirting			0
but the court is not in the business of " condoning " activity , nor is it in a position to adjudicate the fairness of the outcome			2
the court is in the very limited business of applying the law enacted by the legislatures , and it did just that			1
in fact , it carefully applied the definitions provided by both the @entity38 and @entity40 's dictionary			0
the problem is n't the justice ; it 's the statute , as wrtitten , itself			2
general laws c. 272 , § 105 ( b ) provides : " whoever willfully photographs , videotapes or electronically surveils another person who is nude or partially nude , with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity , when the other person in such place and circumstance would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed , videotaped or electronically surveilled , and without that person 's knowledge and consent , shall be ( guilty and punished )			1
" the @entity0 recognized that the statute , as written , breaks down into five elements : 1			2
the victim was nude or partially nude			1
the defendant intended to photograph surreptitiously			0
the victim was in a place where she would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being " so photographed			1
the only elements really in dispute were nos. 2 and 4			0
the defendant 's argument was that , under the statute , the female passenger was not " nude or partially nude , " nor was she in a place where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy			1
the @entity3 had to prove both of these for a conviction , along with the other elements			0
the failure of any one of these elements meant the failure of them all			0
let 's break this down			0
partial nudity first , consider the legal definition of " partially nude			1
" most of our personal definitions of partial nudity were formed by vague warnings from opening credits on @entity96 movies in the 1990s			0
but " partial nudity " is actually a legal concept , with a legal definition			0
the law defines it as " the exposure of the human genitals , buttocks , pubic area or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola			1
" unfortunately , the statute , as written , ded not provide a definition of " exposure , " so the court properly turned to @entity40 's dictionary , which defines it as " a condition or instance of being laid bare or exposed to view			1
" to the court , " partially nude " means having private parts that are uncovered and visible to another person 's eyes			1
" a person who is ... partially nude , " according to the court , is a person who is partially clothed but whose private parts are exposed in plain view when photographed			1
it appears from the court 's opinion that " partially nude " is not to be confused with " almost nude , " as one might be if one 's private parts are covered but she or he is wearing only underwear			1
who knew nudity was so complicated ? what happened to " i know it when i see it ? " apparently , that phrase works for defining pornography , but when it comes to nudity , the court is a bit of a stickler			2
in @entity144 , it appears that a " female passenger on a @entity147 trolley who is wearing a skirt , dress , or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is ' partially nude , ' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing			1
" reasonable expectation of privacy the court went on to discuss the fourth statutory element : whether the victims were " in such place and circumstance ( where the person ) would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed			1
" to the court , because the @entity147 is a public transit system operating in a public place that uses cameras , the two alleged victims -- and all female straphangers -- were not in a place where they reasonably would or could have had an expectation of privacy			1
the prosecution valiantly argued that privacy is less about the location where the photographing occurs than the location on the body photographed			2
the court dismissed this argument			2
while on the subway , a woman has a diminished expectation of privacy ; she wears a skirt at her own risk			0
though reasonable minds can definitely disagree about where we have " reasonable " expectations of privacy , for purposes of this case , it 's immaterial			0
the way the statute was written , the defendant was " not guilty " the moment any one of the statutory elements failed			0
this case was over at " partial nudity			0
" the opinion raises privacy issues unique to female clothing -- and , in particular , the skirt			1
it 's a garment that from 90 % of vantage points completely conceals undergarments			0
it 's the other 10 % that is problematic ; sit or stand in the wrong place or position , and undergarments are now visible			0
even more problematic , if a defendant photographs a woman at the beach in a bikini , she is neither partially nude nor does she have an expectation of privacy			1
but if she then puts on a sarong and hops on a bus , should it be illegal to photograph up her skirt ? this definitely feels like a moral invasion of privacy , but under statutes like the one here , it might not be an illegal invasion of privacy			2
unfortunately for female subway passengers -- and men in kilts -- being upskirted in public by a disturbed person and his camera - phone is still not illegal in @entity144			1
under the statute the @entity0 considered , the act neither photographs partial nudity nor violates a reasonable expectation of privacy			0
that understandably drew some ire			0
indeed , if the law does not change , it represents a harbinger of failed future prosecutions of subway peeping @entity245			0
but ire at the @entity0 is misdirected			0
after all , the justices only interpreted the statute ; they did n't write it .			2

@entity249 : *people* *appalled* by @entity144 " upskirt " ruling , but justices enforcing law as written
he says victim was n't partially nude , was in *non-private* place ; law lets photog take picture
he says opinion raises privacy and moral issues unique to female clothing , mainly skirts
@entity249 : do n't be angry with court ; be angry with legislators who enacted law
