@entity0 -- television cameras are to be allowed into courts in @entity5 and @entity6 for the first time , justice secretary @entity2 announced tuesday			1
the new law will allow the filming only of judges delivering summaries , not victims , witnesses , defendants or juries , the @entity8 said in a statement			1
it will also permit filming only from the @entity19 , with the possibility of later expanding to @entity21 , which handle serious criminal cases such as rape and murder			2
the aim is to " improve transparency and public understanding of court , " @entity2 said			2
lawyer and broadcaster @entity29 , of the law firm @entity31 , praised the move , saying @entity5 and @entity6 were among few countries in the world still to have a blanket ban on cameras in court			1
" this is a very welcome , if cautious and tentative , step towards opening up the court system , " @entity29 told @entity1			0
" it helps the ' open justice ' principle -- the very soil in which justice is planted in this country , in which justice must not only be done , it must be seen to be done			0
" seeing the process in action would help people understand why certain sentences are given , he said -- a subject that has been widely debated as many of those accused of involvement in rioting in @entity5 's cities last month have appeared before the courts			1
the ban on filming in courts in @entity5 and @entity6 dates back to 1925 and will require the passage of new laws to overturn , the @entity61 said			1
no such ban exists in @entity67 , although cameras are not widely allowed into courtrooms			1
the ministry said consultations with the judiciary are planned that would cover newer technologies that could provide for live broadcasts			0
it did not say when the government planned to introduce legislation or when it would take effect			1
legislation announced by the government is generally passed quickly by @entity82			1
filming in courtrooms has been tried already in courts of appeal , @entity29 said , although the footage was not broadcast			0
the trial reassured many members of the judiciary that their concerns could be dealt with in cooperation with broadcasters , he added			0
" clearly there will need to be safeguards in some cases involving the young and the vulnerable , but in most cases i see no reason why there should not be a virtual public gallery , " he said			0
" it will have the effect of instilling a greater -- and justifiable -- sense of pride in , and comprehension of , the way in which our justice system works , " @entity99 said , adding that cameras would boost public scrutiny of judges and court proceedings			2
justice secretary @entity2 also announced plans to publish much more information about each court 's performance			2
data that will be compiled will include " the sentence given , the court , the age group , gender and ethnicity of those sentenced , and the time from when the offence was committed to when the case was complete , " he said			0
the government wants " to allow everyone to see what is happening and how the system works , " @entity2 said			2
court - by - court statistics will start to roll out later this month , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
