@entity0 -- this weekend i hosted part of the @entity4 in @entity0 , set up by a @entity6 - based organization devoting its time to trying to further women 's causes in the world			1
from politics to business , leaders of countries and industries gathered to share their views on women 's empowerment and how to harness their sisters ' contribution to society			1
providing able and ambitious women with the tools for a successful career is n't just the right thing to do , it 's good for business , as some of the biggest economies are finally beginning to grasp			1
after two decades spent in the financial doldrums , @entity29 -- one of the most socially conservative societies on the planet -- is now counting on its hidden female potential to help drag the country out of its 20 - year slump			0
in @entity44 , thanks to the formidable commitment of @entity42 commissioner @entity41 , among others , female participation has increased sharply			0
but to really take hold , moves to mobilize women into the workforce will require more than the usual one - term parliamentary pledge			1
they need generational commitments , major shifts in the cultural mind - set and years of adaptation			0
what 's more , the prescription should not be the same for all countries			1
women in the developing world face a myriad different pressures from those in @entity44 and the @entity61 they also have different priorities			1
so getting a local perspective is key			0
while it 's generally true that education is key to unlocking potential , girls are already doing better than boys at school in many parts of the globe			0
but the glass ceiling remains an ever - present stumbling block			0
two - time president of finland @entity74 believes offering practical childcare options ( for countries that can afford to do so ) is the first step in helping to prevent women feel they have to choose between kids and a career			1
having powerful female role models also gives them encouragement to overcome the bias and stigma many working mothers face			1
president of malta @entity86 -- only the second woman to hold the post -- says the stereotypes of women as purely mother and wife material must be smashed while children are in the classroom			1
she believes the self - belief needed to succeed comes at a tender age			0
it 's fair to say that the choice between having a family and a future in work is n't always a binary one			0
indeed , in today 's day in age more women than ever before have managed to achieve both			1
but , as @entity86 points out , not all women have the luxury of choosing between staying home to raise their offspring and going out to work in a job they enjoy			1
in some nations the lack of access to contraception prevents them from planning when they want to start a family			1
in others , women who want to take time out to raise their children , find themselves forced by their circumstances to have to take on a job they may not want			1
" the reality is if you are poor you do n't have a choice , " she says			0
" so we need to think of better ways to serve these women as well			2
" @entity86 believes that having more women in positions of power politically gives governments the sensitivity and empathy to look out for the marginalized			2
one area where much has been achieved in a relatively short period of time is in the corporate sector			0
quotas forcing boards to bring on more women have done much to smash sexism in the clubby male world of capitalism			2
@entity41 has spearheaded @entity42 moves to make company boards 40 % female			0
but legislature for the very top of an organization can paint an artificial picture of the demographic further down the pay scale			0
women workers were particularly hardly hit during the rounds of layoffs in 2008 , and an alarming number of them remain underemployed four years on -- stuck in jobs that are either part - time or lower paid than before			2
women make all sorts of contributions to society in ways that are n't just related to work and money			2
they play the vital role of raising the next generation			2
but for those who also covet a rewarding career , we owe it to them to get the balance right			0

@entity181 was a host at the @entity4 , where she met business and political leaders
she says countries are starting to discover how *valuable* able and ambitious women are in the workforce
yet still women face a myriad of issues *including* a lack of childcare and *dearth* of role models in senior roles
those in developing countries face far different issues to those in developed nations
