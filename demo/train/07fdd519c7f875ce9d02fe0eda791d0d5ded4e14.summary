@entity1 , @entity0 -- while the election of a new @entity6 president will be making headlines around the world on sunday night , it may well be that the @entity0 parliamentary election results -- marginal as they may be , obscure and hardly decipherable -- will turn out to be more important for the future of the @entity11 and the euro			1
@entity6 voting might alter the core @entity15 policy mix. voters in @entity1 will be sending out an sos			1
what the exact results will be is very hard to tell			2
experienced @entity0 pollsters fear their data might this time prove unreliable : people tend to fume anger instead of discussing politics when called for a poll			1
their findings keep predicting , though , that the two " establishment parties " -- conservative @entity29 and socialist @entity30 -- who have previously notched up 78 % to 86 % of the vote between them , might well lose almost one in two of their 2009 voters			1
faithful voters who have never betrayed their allegiance to one of the two main political families , descendants of the @entity35 and @entity36 of the 19th century divide , are for the first time considering going against tradition			1
the left wing vote is expected to double , and extreme right wing votes may triple			0
lackluster politicians who , overnight , turned from obscure backbenchers to leaders of new , radical , parties are dreaming of double - digit scores			2
and a gang of black - clad @entity53 admirers who polled just 0.2 % in 2009 is threatening to pass the 3 % threshold and make a violent entry in parliament			0
there is a sense of @entity59 vu to all that			0
all elections in crisis hit countries , during the current @entity64 , from @entity65 to @entity66 and from @entity67 to @entity68 , have fallen under the same pattern : government washed away , governing party defeated , extreme , nationalistic parties on the rise			1
@entity0 would n't be an exception			1
but it is not just a repeat			0
@entity0 is the first country to head for elections with its economy not just in recession but in a full - on depression			1
@entity0 will have lost 20 % of its pre-crisis gdp by the end of 2012			1
the economy has lost in 24 months a number of jobs equal to those created over the last decade , with unemployment over 21 %			0
labor costs are expected to fall by over 20 % and the tax burden on labor income has become the highest among @entity94 countries			0
was this the expected outcome of the austerity program attached to the bailout and applied by the euro - partners and the @entity100 two years ago ? not really			2
the recession was initially predicted by the @entity100 to be -7.5 %			0
the rise in unemployment was under - predicted by half			0
@entity0 was supposed to have regained its credibility and return to the bond markets by early 2012 with its economy back on growth			2
a failure of predictions , mass impoverishment and destitution , a recession that leads to failure to meet fiscal targets , growing social unrest : @entity0 , the poster child of austerity as cure - cum - punishment , is becoming the clear proof of the recipe 's shortcomings			2
how does that translate into politics ? in all the previous cases of elections in these times of recession , the parties that were unlucky enough to be in power when the crisis struck were punished , and alternative governments that did carry on with fiscal adjustment replaced incumbent governments			1
it happened in all cases under @entity100 or joint @entity100 - @entity11 programs from @entity138 to @entity139 to @entity140			0
in the @entity0 case , for the very first time , we might see a disapproval of both governing and opposition parties			1
@entity30 , the party in power when the country suffered its debilitating heart attack , will take a beating			0
but the alternative party , the conservatives , discredited by its pre-crisis record in power and doubly discredited by its participation in a coalition government implementing austerity measures , might be beaten too			0
the two of them , together might , and probably will have enough seats in parliament to form a coalition government , but their combined score will send a warning throughout @entity15			0
austerity and no growth , recession and unemployment , dictates from @entity169 and @entity170 and @entity171 and no consensus building at home , carry a real risk of de-legitimizing not just the euro project but @entity15 democracies as such			2
it should be read as a democratic sos			2
not as a sign that the country does not acknowledge the fact that it is facing ( alone , with @entity68 ) a true debt crisis and has a genuine need for fiscal adjustment , but as a sign that if @entity15 does not change its austerity dogma and invent new , more @entity15 , ways of decision making , even a small country like @entity0 , where 80 % of the electorate still believes in the @entity15 project and the euro , recession will win over politics			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity0 voters go to polls sunday in first election since euro crisis
*journalist* @entity203 says electorate will be " sending out an sos "
@entity206 : *mainstream* parties likely to be punished for their role in the financial crisis
extremist political *movements* may benefit from voters ' anger
