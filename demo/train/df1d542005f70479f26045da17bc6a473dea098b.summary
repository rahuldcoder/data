@entity1 's police chief was deeply offended			0
" it 's obscene , " he declared , and promptly arrested six young men and women who made a joyful fan video , dancing and lip - synching to the sound of @entity10 ' huge hit , " happy			1
" clap your hands if this sounds like one of the most ridiculous stories you ever heard			2
the six @entity19 , wearing colorful clothes , stylish sun shades and bright bandanas , dared to dance to the beat of " happy			1
" the women did not cover their heads with the required hijab			1
at times , the men and women danced together , which is forbidden and punishable under the law			2
but elsewhere -- when the police are n't looking -- @entity19 men and women dance together and see nothing wrong with it			1
but the police found it offensive			0
@entity19 state media called it " vulgar			1
" the backlash against the arrests was forceful , and before long , the police released the dancers , although the director of the video apparently remains in custody			1
the group describes itself as " @entity1 @entity43 , " which may strike the oversensitive authorities in the @entity45 as a highly subversive political affiliation			0
the nefarious motivation for making the video was revealed at the end of the clip , which reads , " ' @entity51 ' was an excuse to be happy			1
we enjoyed every second of making it			2
hope it puts a smile on your face			0
" as the opposition @entity64 noted , " the irony that the @entity19 youth were arrested for dancing to a song called ' happy ' seems to be lost on the @entity19 authorities			1
the @entity19 people can not be forced to live in a world where ( nuclear ) enrichment is a right , but happiness is not			1
" more than 100,000 people have viewed the @entity19 version of " happy , " which stirred up a bizarre political storm			1
@entity1 police chief @entity83 boasted of taking less than six hours to round up the evildoers and lock them up , but not before parading them before the television cameras , a stern warning to other young people who might be getting any crazy ideas in their heads ; no telling what may lurk in the minds of youngsters listening to @entity10 ' lyrics			0
@entity10 tweeted , " it 's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness			2
" @entity19 president @entity94 posted his own tweet , apparently quoting a statement he made more than a year ago , " # happiness is our people 's right			1
we should n't be too hard on behaviors caused by joy			2
" yes , it all seems incredible silly			0
behind the absurdity , ongoing tensions are shaping life in @entity19			1
there is a boiling over of frustration among a large part of the @entity19 population fed up with the restrictions imposed by the regime			1
the " @entity51 " video showed defiance from two groups who are chafing under the limits imposed by the authorities : young people and women			1
from the moment the @entity122 revolution took power in @entity19 , women , who had enjoyed @entity120 - style freedoms , started to endure new rules restricting their lives			1
the mandate to cover with a hijab stands as the most visible , ever - present and personally offensive of those rules			2
every year for the last 35 , the arrival of summer brings a battle between women pushing against the rules in the @entity19 heat and regime backers fighting against the loosening of restrictions			1
a few days ago , a @entity140 page went up called @entity141			0
in it , @entity19 women of all ages are posting pictures of themselves free from the restrictive clothing			1
the pictures show women dancing , smiling , with their arms extended , as if reaching for freedom , commenting on " the feeling of wind blowing through every strand of hair			2
" one wrote , " i am a 68 - year - old woman ... i want to be free and comfortable in my own skin			0
" another vows " we will get freedom of dressing , singing , dancing			0
... " on friday , a counterdemonstration took to the streets of @entity1 , demanding that authorities crack down on dress code violations and enforce the code on women			0
protesters carried signs that showed a sexy red stiletto shoe with a red line across it			0
clothing connotes free expression to some , a grave threat to others			0
the battle over social freedoms mirrors the contest in the government , where more conservative members are pushing back against @entity94 , who is considered a moderate by the @entity45 's unique standards , and is trying to improve @entity19 's international relations and image abroad			2
the arrest of the dancers came just after @entity94 gave a speech about @entity189 freedoms in which he declared " we must recognize our citizens ' right to connect to the @entity192			0
" the president , who is not the most powerful leader in the country , asked " why are we so shaky ? why have we cowered in a corner ... lest we take a bullet in this culture war ? " the speech was supposed to be broadcast on national television , but it was not			0
one of @entity94 's aides reportedly blamed a former member of the @entity204 for blocking the speech from television			0
the @entity204 and the president both answer to the unelected supreme leader @entity207			0
there is no word so far on how @entity207 feels about @entity10 ' hit song and the dancers			0
no word , so far , on whether the @entity213 is happy .			0

six @entity19 are arrested and later released for making a *fun* video
@entity217 : it is ridiculous they got in *trouble* for dancing to the hit " @entity51 "
she says the *incident* is a sign of frustration with the limits imposed by @entity19
@entity229 : for one thing , women should n't have to wear restrictive clothing like hijab
