-- singer @entity1 moved to the @entity2 as a child but his football heart remains in @entity5			1
as @entity5 prepares to play @entity6 on monday -- after losing to @entity7 in the first group game -- he talks to @entity0 about his heroes , football memories and fitting in games while doing promotion work			1
did you play football as a kid ? yes , i used to play right wing when i was a kid			2
i do n't play any more			2
i probably could not play for more than five minutes , i 'd be in the ground			2
i 've got no endurance whatsoever			0
maybe after a tour but not before one			0
as a kid i played in @entity5 til i was 8			1
i was medium , not great but not bad			0
then i moved to the @entity2 -- 20 years ago soccer was not as big in the @entity2 as it is now -- and i was actually pretty good in comparison to the rest of the players at the time			0
the coach would always put me in to play			0
the best memories were of scoring goals			0
when you score you felt like you were on top of the world			0
my favorite player back then was @entity35			0
the second goal he scored against @entity38 [ in 1986 @entity39 ) was so , so magnificent			1
it made the rest of the world -- maybe not @entity38 -- forget the handball goal and say " ok , you deserved to win			0
" who are your favorite players at this @entity39 ? between @entity47 and @entity48			1
and @entity49 and @entity50 and @entity51 and @entity52 and @entity53			0
what does the @entity39 mean to you ? my album " @entity56 " comes out in july and that means i am promoting it in all june and july			1
that was the only thing i hated about this album to the point that three weeks ago i called the president of the record company and told him that i wanted to delay my album and move it to september due to the @entity39			1
i was keen on it			0
i 'm like " please , please , please , " i begged and they said " if you move it to september just to watch the @entity39 we will never speak to you again			1
i was " come on , it is once every four years " and they were " come on , your albums are once every three years			0
" will @entity1 have a summer hit ? the @entity39 is the only time my career comes second			1
it 's crucial to me			2
when @entity5 plays they did promise me they would clear my schedule			1
how do you think @entity5 will do ? the worst part was i was in @entity81 for the @entity83 game and they cleared the schedule for two hours and i got to watch @entity5 and i got to see them lose			1
after that i did n't want to do more interviews			0
it was one of those games that you watch and you say how could we have lost ? you can tell their skill and they were the better team but at the end of the day it 's ' you ca n't forgive in football , ' you have to go for it			1
it 's not always the better team that wins and what matters is the final score			2
if there 's one @entity39 where you would think this is the time where they have a chance , i would think it 's this one			1
ever since i was a little kid @entity5 was always good , always promised a lot but they never quite get there			1
@entity0 tracks the @entity39 this time , since the @entity114 ( @entity115 championships ) , things have changed			1
from @entity49 to @entity117 to @entity50 to @entity52 to @entity118 to @entity119 , you have @entity51 , you have @entity53			0
you just have such a complete team , and they are so talented and each player is so good			0
but now there 's a lot of pressure			2
if @entity126 wins their group and if @entity5 qualifies second they have to play @entity126			1
i would rather @entity5 wins the group and plays @entity130 or @entity131			2
who do you think will do well ? i think @entity134 will go all the way or close			0
i got to watch a bit of the @entity138 game and they were really good			2
it will boil down to those teams -- to @entity134 , to @entity126 , @entity141 always starts bad and ends up in a good place , @entity140 will be there			0
and hopefully @entity5 will be in there			2
it 's so difficult to tell in the @entity39 because anything can happen			1
what are your best and worst memories of football ? worst was the 2002 ( @entity39 )			1
i think the referee made major mistakes to the point that it was so so obvious it almost made you think something was going on			0
it was too , too obvious			0
the best , when i was 5 years old , the @entity39 in @entity5 in ' 82 , the mascot was @entity160			1
the @entity141 - @entity140 game , i was there			0
he was my idol in that @entity39 .			2

@entity164 cleared to watch @entity5 's @entity39 games
@entity1 : i wanted to delay album release so i could watch the @entity39
defeat to @entity7 was " devastating "
best memory was at @entity5 ' 82 ; worst was at 2002 @entity39
