during his visit , he took on the aura of a virtual celebrity , surrounded by dozens of reporters , aides , and well - wishers			0
@entity2 , a state senator who defeated @entity9 state attorney general @entity16 on tuesday , is the first @entity3 @entity6 to win a @entity18 race since 1972			1
his win stripped @entity9 of their filibuster - proof 60 - seat @entity18 supermajority and has forced the @entity23 @entity22 to reconsider its options for passing a health care bill			1
one of the problems with @entity0 is that " there seems to be no transparency " on health care negotiations and other issues , @entity2 told reporters			1
" people are outraged by that			0

this is the best place in the world when it comes to solving problems , and we 've kind of lost our way , " he added			0
@entity2 's first meeting was with sen. @entity46 , @entity47			2
@entity46 , the 2008 @entity6 presidential nominee , was an early backer of @entity2 's bid to fill the last three years of the late sen. @entity51 's term			1

" they want the kind of leadership that the commonwealth of @entity3 just sent us			1
" @entity2 also met with @entity63 , the senior senator from @entity3			1
in the last week of the heated campaign , @entity63 , the @entity9 ' 2004 presidential nominee , accused @entity2 supporters of " bullying and threats " and urged @entity2 to speak out and get his supporters under control			2
the two senators had a friendlier exchange thursday , however , with @entity63 expressing hope that @entity2 will be seated soon			1
" i think seating @entity2 as expeditiously as possible is important			2
we want to respect the election results , " @entity63 said			0

" i 'm more of a states ' rights person , " he said			0
the plan being pushed by @entity9 before his election was n't good for his home state , @entity2 argued			0
@entity3 residents should n't " pay higher taxes and have half a trillion in [ @entity110 ] cuts and basically be subsidizing places like @entity112 when we already have 98 percent of our people insured , " he said			1
" we have a very good plan			0
it did n't make sense			0
" @entity3 implemented its own health care reform bill in 2006			0
