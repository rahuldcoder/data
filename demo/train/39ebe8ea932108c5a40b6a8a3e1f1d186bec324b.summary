@entity0 -- the peak of a cloud of volcanic ash that forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights has passed , @entity3 's prime minister said wednesday			1
" the worst is over , " prime minister @entity9 said			0
" and now the clean - up can begin			0
our geoscientists say that the eruption is waning day by day and that the problems arising in our neighboring countries as a result of volcanic ash should be resolved quickly			1
" according to the @entity18 , the eruption of the @entity21 volcano " paused " at 2:40 a.m. wednesday ( 10:40 p.m. tuesday et ) , meaning it was not erupting at the moment			1
the agency warned , however , that it could begin again , and that only after three months with no eruptions will the volcano be considered dormant			0
meanwhile , some @entity28 airports were reopened wednesday after cancellations due to the cloud of volcanic ash			1
@entity31 has reopened and @entity32 is allowing takeoffs and landings , according to @entity35 , the @entity28 aviation safety agency			0
airports in @entity0 will resume flights at 2 p.m. local time ( 8 a.m. et )			0
the closures affected at least 600 flights in @entity28 , authorities said			2
@entity46 could be affected later in the day , the @entity44 air traffic control agency @entity45 said			1
@entity47 , the spokesman for the @entity49 airport in @entity50 , said as of wednesday afternoon flights into @entity50 were still being accepted			2
but the ash cloud is dissipating and much of the rest of @entity44 air travel is expected to be running normally wednesday , the agency said			1
a portion of the ash from saturday 's eruption in @entity3 had spread over @entity60 by tuesday afternoon , with the cloud reaching @entity63 's @entity62 around lunchtime , a computer model indicated			1
@entity45 reported about 500 flights in @entity60 airspace were canceled tuesday			2
@entity62 alone normally operates about 1,300 flights a day , and @entity44 as a whole has about 29,000 daily , according to @entity45			1
the @entity21 eruption came about 13 months after @entity3 's @entity71 volcano belched smoke and ash into the skies over the continent , forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights per day at the peak of the problem			1
the ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft , reducing visibility , damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail			0
@entity21 's eruption was more than 10 times larger and put more ash into the air in 36 hours than last year 's burst did in a month , @entity87 geophysicist @entity86 told @entity1 tuesday -- but the main eruption is now over , he said			1
disruptions from the larger eruption are likely to be smaller than they were in 2010 , said @entity96 , a geophysicist at @entity60 's @entity97			0
most of the ash is blowing northwest , toward sparsely populated @entity99 , and the @entity44 aviation industry collected valuable safety data during last year 's event			2
" it 's much better able to set the safety thresholds accurately , so i think things are probably going to turn out very well for us , " @entity96 said			0
airlines have been making the case that it is safe to fly through ash clouds of medium density , @entity60 's @entity107 said tuesday			0
carriers including @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 are now free to fly through clouds of up to 4,000 micrograms per cubic meter if they feel it is safe to do so , @entity120 of the @entity107 told @entity1			0
@entity21 lies beneath @entity3 's @entity122 glacier , a sheet of ice more than three times the size of the @entity127 state of @entity128 -- larger than any on mainland @entity44			1
@entity21 is the country 's most active volcano and last erupted in 2004 , according to the @entity18			1
" if history is any guide , we expect the next eruption to be in five to six years , " said the agency 's @entity131 on wednesday			2
in 1783 , a 16.7 - mile fissure system from the volcano produced the world 's largest known historical lava flow over a seven - month period , damaging crops and livestock , according to the @entity143			0
a resulting famine led to the death of one - fifth of @entity3 's population , according to the museum			2
@entity1 's @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0

@entity46 could be affected later wednesday
