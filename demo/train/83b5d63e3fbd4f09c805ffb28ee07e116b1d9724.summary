-- when it comes to fast food , the big chains ca n't help going over the top			0
april brought consumers the @entity6 heard around the world -- a bunless bomb o ' meat from @entity10 touting the slogan " it 's real			1
" bloggers taste - tested it , the @entity15 's restaurant critic reviewed it , it was a top trending topic @entity17 alongside the likes of @entity19 - and after two weeks , did the company 's @entity6 wager pay off ? the stakes are high indeed , especially after @entity10 's sales fell 5.8 percent in 2009 , according to food industry research firm , @entity24			1
" unfortunately , we are not able to provide sales information , " @entity10 's public relations manager , @entity25 , told @entity0			1
those numbers only become available from @entity28 ! brands , the chain 's parent company that also owns @entity31 and @entity32 , during its quarterly reporting			0
" it [ the @entity6 ] continues to generate a tremendous amount of online buzz , from videotaped taste tests on @entity39 to real - time , in - store reviews via @entity17			2
if social media is an indication , the @entity6 is developing quite a cult following			2
but does the adage " any publicity is good publicity " hold true ? " stunt food has been a part of restaurant life probably since the first time a chef put a napkin over a customer 's head in order to serve him a whole , rare , roasted ortolan , " ( a legendarily decadent meal of a fatty bird , bones and all ) wrote @entity61 , the @entity15 restaurant critic			0
if the past is any indicator , the @entity62 of the fast food realm have worked			0
though their calorie count is a lot more evil than @entity68			0
@entity70 - based @entity69 rolled out its now - infamous @entity71 in 2004			2
the self - proclaimed " monument to decadence " features two 1/3 pound @entity73 beef patties , four bacon strips , three slices of @entity77 cheese , and mayonnaise on a buttered sesame seed bun - and clocks in at approximately 1,420 calories and 107 grams of fat			0
for @entity85 's , the sales for the fast food chain have risen steadily since it found its niche in behemoth burgers			1
the @entity71 produced an 8 percent growth in sales during its first year alone			1
" and i have to give @entity10 credit for doing something to get rid of all that grilled chicken , " said @entity93 , public relations and social media manager of @entity85 's @entity96			1
" oh , and we 've been doing that non-bread - as - a - carrier - thing since 2003 with the @entity103 and @entity104			0
" lettuce replaces the bun in these creations			0
in 2005 , @entity108 went against the fast food industry trend of offering more healthy choices by introducing the @entity111 -- two eggs , two slices of cheese and three slices of bacon and sausage on a large bun			1
the 760 - calorie no - utensils - required meal helped increase @entity108 's breakfast sales by 20 percent			1
the sandwich has since been discontinued in @entity77 stores			0
though these successes contain one thing the @entity6 is fairly modest in : calorie count			2
the @entity6 weighs in at 540 calories , 32 grams of fat , and 1,380 milligrams of sodium			2
while that 's still well over half the average adult 's recommended recommended daily allowance of sodium and nearly half a day 's fat intake , it 's practically a novelty compared to other chains ' dietary assaults			0
according to @entity140 , this type of product could muddy @entity10 's image after the chain heavily promoted the ostensibly healthful release of its grilled chicken in 2009 and most recently , its " buckets for the @entity149 " affiliation with cancer - fighting charity powerhouse , the @entity147			0
" the series of stunts drove buzz and the introduction of grilled chicken spiked short - term sales , the moves also contributed to a lack of consistent brand positioning and a distraction from @entity10 's flagship product -- both of which have hurt the chain , " said @entity150			1
despite the buzz , the @entity6 is still planned for a limited time only release -- through may 23 .			1

@entity10 launched its a bunless bomb o ' meat -- but did @entity6 boost sales ?
advertising age : @entity10 stunts contributed to a lack of consistent brand positioning
but @entity85 got a boost in sales from its @entity71
in 2005 , @entity108 got a boost from its @entity111
