-- they 've been separated for about a year - and - a - half , but @entity2 and @entity3 are proving once again they have no hard feelings			1
@entity0 confirms a report that @entity3 is set to guest star on " @entity8 's " season 3 finale as a concierge who crosses paths with @entity13 ( @entity2 ) and [ spoiler alert ] her bridal party			1
as you might now , this season , ( finally ) starting february 14 , will see @entity2 's character getting engaged to @entity19 ( which , creator @entity20 recently joked with @entity0 , " pretty much makes it the worst [ show ] title in the history of television " )			1
all of this , of course , comes at the end of a season riddled with as much fun as there is wine in the veins of the cul - de - sac crew			2
but what exactly is in store ? in addition to what @entity0 scooped up out at @entity39 , here 's some more intel for you to drink up ( some of which loyal readers of @entity0 's @entity46 are already privy to ) : - @entity47 ( @entity48 ) spends seven episodes in a helmet , following an accident that leaves him with a skull fracture			2
" our loyal fans and the writers and staff of the show hated his hair last year , and i was trying to think of a suitable punishment , " jokes creator @entity20			0
" he wears a big white foam helmet			0
but i think not only is it funny , but in a positive way , it teaches this young actor not to have ridiculous hair that people complain about			0
" adds @entity2 : " i do n't know that his hair looks much better now			1
" - @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , who will later this season also get a new love interest , opens a cake business after she and @entity75 ways			0
" that 's funny in the way that unfolds , " @entity20 teases			0
- @entity79 ( @entity78 ) finds a girlfriend in " @entity81 ' " @entity82			1
" besides the fact that i think she 's very talented and the episodes are funny , it was fun for @entity2 and me and the others to have her around her because she 's a friend , " says @entity20			1
- speaking of " scrubs , " @entity90 will also appear , but , says @entity20 , " i can only smile because one of the agreements i always make with friends that do favors for me [ is that ] when they are n't doing big guest star parts , i [ wo n't ] use them to promote the show			1
but i am allowed to say that it is one little scene this year that will certainly melt the brain of different ' @entity81 ' fans			1
" - @entity13 and @entity19 go to marriage counseling , a storyline , in part , inspired by @entity2 , according to @entity20			1
" when it comes to shrinks , one of the funniest things , between @entity111 and me , is that she 's a believer in counseling and therapy and stuff			2
and i 've often heard her tell stories or jokingly say that i should go to therapy with her , so it makes me really laugh -- the idea that @entity13 not only believes in [ therapy ] for herself but for the people around her , both to help them and as a threat because they misbehave , " he says			2
- there 's an appearance from @entity125 , a.k.a. @entity127 's a cappella band from " scrubs			0
" - @entity19 's past comes back to bite him			1
two words : love child			0
" we pursued this story last year and for the first two years of @entity136 ' character , @entity19 , wanting a kid and @entity2 's character being up for anything			1
so as writers , we had to solve that , and i did n't think we wanted to do an adoption story because @entity2 did that very well on ' friends , ' " he said			2
in fact , @entity20 says , that 's the situation they often run into			0
" one of the worst things about working with @entity2 is that every time you come up with what you think is a big funny interpersonal story , someone in the writer 's room -- because they all loved her on ' friends ' -- will be like ' yeah , that 's like when @entity159 and @entity160 adopted a baby ... ' and i 'm like ' shut up , i 'm going to kill you			1
' i 'm not as familiar with ' friends ' as i should be			0
i would have watched it constantly , but one of the people that created that show fired me early on , so i stopped watching it out of spite			0
" " you think i do n't have a filter ? ! " @entity2 responds with a laugh			2
" you do n't have a filter			0
