@entity0 -- armed with a silky - smooth voice and an uncompromising spirit , @entity3 singer / songwriter @entity2 has won admirers around the world			1
with a career spanning nearly two decades , the @entity3 singer has often been described as one of music 's best - kept secrets			1
@entity2 says that although he can hear " the hidden compliment " in that phrase , he works hard to do even better			1
" it 's not right that i should be a secret , i mean this is n't a profession in which to be kept a secret , " he says			2
" you stand on a stage and put it out there because you want as many people as possible to hear your song or your idea or your message			0
" his musical style blends his @entity30 roots with elements of jazz and soul , while his passionate singing moves between the heights and depths of emotion			1
in tune with his wide - ranging vocal skills , @entity39 's songs encompass a wide range of topics , from personal experiences to social - minded commentary			2
" i write songs about why in my dear continent we spend as much time as we do harking back to the things that were done to us in the past when , although they are incredibly valid these sentiments , there is also the argument for as much time to be put into finding our way out of this difficult situation , " says @entity2			1
born in @entity0 to @entity3 parents , the velvet - voiced singer moved to @entity3 at an early age			1
the vivid memories of pounding @entity30 drums and spicy @entity3 food followed him back to the @entity66 where he returned just before he turned 17			1
that transition was n't without its challenges , says @entity2 , as he spent the first couple of years trying to figure out his place in the world while bridging his different cultures			1
" i spent a very long time working out where i fitted in the whole scheme of things , " he says			0
" subconsciously i think i very much wanted to be a @entity3 , wanted very much to be an @entity30 and i had to work out a way of negotiating how i could do that whilst knowing that for survival purposes also i had to assimilate as much as possible into where i found myself in amongst here			2
" initially set for a career in law , @entity2 abandoned his studies to follow his passion for music and pursue a rather more uncertain career as a singer			1
his talents did n't go unnoticed and in the early 1990s he was signed by record label @entity87			0
however , his encounter with the system of big record companies did n't last long			0
" i learned through bitter experience what i definitely , absolutely wanted and what i did n't , " he says			0
" ( there was ) a lot of kind pre-described , focus group - type artist development where you 'd bring a song in and people take their metaphorical scalpels out and shave bits -- ' the kids wo n't love that , the kids wo n't love that ' -- take bits off			0
" when the deal fell apart little more than a year later , @entity2 says he knew " without a shadow of a doubt that i wanted as much autonomy as possible and that would mean walking my own path independently			2
" @entity112 's perseverance saw him eventually building his own studio and setting up his own label			2
he has seven albums under his belt so far , and his latest offering , " @entity118 , " was released earlier in 2011			0
as in his previous works , @entity112 's @entity30 roots are evident in his latest album and influence the message he is trying to convey			0
he says : " i 'm very keen for @entity30 to change its course , to find its way and really find a way of standing shoulder to shoulder with the league of nations			0
" if i switch on the news and i see another sad story about @entity30 , i wonder , i want to write a song that says how come we have n't managed to get across the fact that repeatedly on the @entity135 ' happiest countries lists the top 10 counties are almost always @entity30 ? i mean how come we do n't get that story across ? how come it 's always the representations of poverty and corruption , brutality ?
