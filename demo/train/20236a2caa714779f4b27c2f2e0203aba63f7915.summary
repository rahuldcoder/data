-- could sewage be recycled to provide water that 's cleaner than what comes out of your tap ? the place to find out is the small yet highly urbanized city - state of @entity8			1
the @entity11 - east @entity10 island country has a population of 5 million residing on less than 750 square kilometers of land			1
whilst known for its strong economy , @entity8 is lacking one essential asset -- water			2
water security has long been a national priority in @entity8 as half of its current water supplies are imported from neighboring @entity22			1
" we are preparing for the day that should the water agreement expire , we should be ready to fulfill our own needs , " says @entity23 , chief executive of the @entity24			0
the agreement with @entity22 is due to expire in 2061 , so the country has time to be ready			2
@entity8 's strategy for a hydrated nation is four-fold : as well as importation , it includes desalinization plants , efficient catchment of rainwater and recycling of sewage			1
@entity39 is collected through a network of drains , canals , rivers , storm water , collection ponds and reservoirs with the aim to catch water across two - thirds of the country			2
but the real hope lies in the membrane technology to treat wastewater known as ' newater ' , created by the country 's public utilities board			1
through a four - step series of barriers and membranes , wastewater is made free of solids , microorganisms , and contaminants resulting in potable water supplies for use by humans and industry			1
after one decade , the technology meets 30 percent of @entity8 's water needs , with plans to triple volumes by 2060			1
" the level of quality we receive from the @entity79 meets and exceeds the expectation , " explains @entity70 , ceo of @entity71 , where the water is used in their processing of silicon wafers			0
" we are using the water three times before we let it into the drain , " he says			0
the demand by industry is being further met by a new collaboration with @entity88 firm @entity87 that will supply factories with recycled industrial water			1
one and a half @entity92 - sized swimming pools of water are currently filtered and treated every day			0
the goal is to more cost - effectively treat industrial waste streams in the long run			0
professor @entity98 from the @entity99 feels other countries should follow the example set by @entity8 and even the current standards can be improved to eventually re-use every last drop of water			2
" there are two major future challenges , " he says			0
" @entity107 is how to make the water system less energy intensive and the second one is consumer behavior with respect to water			0
" if these challenges can be overcome , this small country will continue to flourish , long into the future			0
read more from @entity117 : shared space , where the streets have no rules invisible solar panels hidden in your windows ? they 're coming @entity126 's idea for future mobility ? the good old bus			0

@entity8 currently imports 50 percent of its water from @entity22 .
with 5 million *people* living in the country new *options* for water supplies are needed .
newater technologies are *transforming* wastewater to qualities better than that in your tap .
30 percent of @entity8 's water supply is currently met by recycled water .
