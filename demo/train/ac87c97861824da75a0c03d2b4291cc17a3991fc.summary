-- it 's hard to believe another year is coming to end			1
where on earth did 2013 go ? while we try to answer that question , we 're thinking about the year that was -- and all the stories that inspired us , those that made us crazy and those we could n't stop talking to our friends about -- on and offline			2
we put our list together based on those stories that resonated the most on @entity0 and in social media -- the 20 stories that seemed to spark the biggest conversations among women this year			1
( click on our gallery above to see them all ! ) no surprise that @entity23 tops our list			1
if the former @entity26 star 's goal was to be one of the most talked about women of 2013 , she arguably succeeded			2
her twerking at the @entity30 ( full disclosure -- i did n't know what twerking was until the @entity34 ! ) followed by her nearly nude performance in a video for her single " @entity37 " got tongues wagging all over the country			0
will @entity23 continue to shock in 2014 ? we 'll be watching ! @entity40 : 2013 : the year in pictures other women who generated some heated debate this year include @entity44 , the @entity45 chief operating officer whose book " @entity46 " became an immediate best - seller			1
but was @entity44 , a mom of two , accusing women of not being ambitious enough or not doing enough to put more cracks in the glass ceiling , many women asked this year ? many women criticized @entity54 ceo @entity53 for banning working from home , and for donning a designer dress and stiletto heels in a sexy pose for @entity59			1
i sided with others who asked : why ca n't a woman be smart and beautiful and sexy ? the sexualization of girls was another big topic in 2013 illuminated not just by @entity23 but by media outlets counting the days until @entity67 , one of the youngest members of the @entity70 clan , turned 18			1
" there is a countdown clock waiting for a girl to turn 18 so they can ( ogle ) her more inappropriately then they already do , " reader @entity71 said on @entity0 's @entity45 page			1
" i think it 's a valid question about the appropriateness of waiting for a young lady to age so you can objectify her as a sex object			0
" there were many inspiring moments this year for women , too , such as that @entity88 ad campaign , which went viral , showcasing our inability as women to see just how beautiful we are			1
one of our favorite ads ever , about a fictional place called ' @entity94 , ' took the internet by storm			0
in the ad , a tween is the first girl to get her period at camp , what she calls her " red badge of courage , " and proudly sets out to teach her pals about this milestone			2
we were inspired by celebrities too , such as @entity109 whose " @entity111 " video motivated a 16 - year - old @entity113 girl named @entity114 with an inoperable brain tumor to do her own version			1
two months after @entity117 recorded her " @entity111 " video , which brings me to tears every single time i watch it , she died			1
@entity123 took to @entity124 , telling her 48 million followers ( she bumped @entity126 from the top spot on @entity124 this year ) that @entity117 's strength and spirit inspired her and so many others			2
and how could we not mention @entity131 , the 5 - year - old leukemia patient from @entity132 ? he won the hearts of people around the world when he joined @entity137 fighting crime in a made - up @entity138 as part of a wish granted by the @entity141			1
@entity40 : the year in entertainment there were big debates among parents , too			0
the documentary " @entity147 , " showcased on @entity0 , prompted families to discuss whether to take their kids to @entity150			0
the question of whether schools go too far in enforcing zero tolerance policies also came up after a 17 - year - old who hugged a teacher and a 6 - year - old who kissed a fellow first grader were suspended for sexual harassment			0
some relatively unknown women were thrust into the national spotlight this year			0
@entity161 , a @entity162 state senator , became a hero to women abortion rights supporters when she staged a dramatic 11 - hour filibuster			0
@entity167 , the wife of the former @entity169 mayoral candidate @entity168 , also got women talking for her decision to stick with her husband after his second bout with sexting and reports that she blamed herself for his indiscretions			0
and there were definitely some lighter moments that we women loved to dish about , from @entity185 's bangs ( yes , they really generated a ton of conversation ! ) to the arrival of @entity189 with @entity190 showing the world that contrary to what you see in @entity194 , women do actually have a post-baby belly right after giving birth			2
i always love these opportunities to look back and showcase the issues and stories that really struck a chord with us			0
we just must might be talking about them again next year			0
until then , can we go back to that question from the top -- where did 2013 go ? follow @entity207 on @entity124 and like @entity208 on @entity45 .			0
