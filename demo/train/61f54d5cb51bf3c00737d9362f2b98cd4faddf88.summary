@entity0 , @entity1 -- mr. president , the midterm elections are over			1
you 're out of excuses			2
your stalling has worn thin			2
and the hour is late			0
it 's time to keep your word and do what you promised to do before the end of summer â € ” use the executive power of the presidency to fix part of the immigration system and offer relief to millions of undocumented immigrants			1
of course , there 's a lot of debate about what that " fix " would look like			1
you seem to be considering two specific goals : decreasing the number of deportations and strengthening border security			0
the former might mean giving temporary work permits to 1 or 2 million people			1
the latter is low - hanging fruit , since both @entity34 and @entity35 are always eager to throw money at the border by hiring more agents and building more walls			1
the trouble is that activists want a lot more -- a total moratorium on deportations , and the expansion of the @entity47 program beyond its intended beneficiaries ( undocumented young people brought as children ) to include the parents of @entity47 recipients and parents with @entity55 - born children			2
they want work permits for as many as 4 or 5 million people			2
frankly , as i 've said before , i do n't think any of this is going to happen			0
this week 's election is over , but there 's always another series of elections around the corner			0
given that many @entity55 still resist the idea of rewarding illegal activity by conferring legal status to the undocumented , for other @entity34 there would be a significant downside to using executive action			1
who would worry ? for one , probably @entity74 , who is eager to run for president in 2016 but not eager to take the blame for executive action taken by the previous president			1
besides , mr. president , let 's look at what you told reporters in this week 's press conference			2
you said , " i have no doubt that there will be some republicans who are angered or frustrated by any executive action that i may take			2
" may take ? do n't you mean " will " take ? and , if i 'm wrong and something does happen on the executive front , it likely wo n't be what immigration activists want			1
you might throw them a crumb , which the loyal @entity34 who have been apologists for your administration will generously declare a full loaf of bread			0
time and again , you have held out the promise of executive action to @entity104 voters who want reform and who are furious at you for deporting a record 2 million people in five years			2
those of us with long memories can appreciate the irony of this exercise given that you spent much of your first term arguing that you were n't " a king " and insisting you did n't have the executive power you now claim to be eager to use			1
meanwhile , mr. president , you 've used the promise of executive action as a cynical ploy intended to distract critics and rally support for @entity121 candidates for elective office			1
the sad part is that , for a while , it actually worked			0
but , take a look at the election returns			0
it 's not working anymore			0
hispanics never turn out in large numbers for midterm elections			0
even so , this year 's showing was weaker than usual			0
according to some exit polls , @entity104 voters made up only 8 % of 2014 voters			0
it was 10 % in 2012			0
if you want people to vote , you 've got to get them excited and interested and vested in the outcome of the election			0
@entity34 did n't do that with @entity104 voters			0
perhaps that 's because , in places like the @entity146 , they were busy impersonating @entity35			1
and speaking of the @entity35 , there 's no argument that your loyal opposition is part of the problem			1
the day after retaking the @entity153 , they were already blasting away at what they 're calling your planned " executive amnesty			2
for one thing , amnesty is a permanent legislative solution , and all the president has the power to do is offer temporary relief			1
for another , if @entity35 are really that nervous about the president acting on his own on immigration reform , then they should do something they 've been reluctant to do for decades â € ” cobble together a bill that offers legal status to at least some of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the @entity55			1
is n't that exactly what @entity174 , the 2012 @entity35 nominee , recently predicted would happen if voters put the @entity153 back in the hands of @entity35 ? well consider it done			1
now , we might ask , where is the willingness on the part of @entity35 lawmakers to pass an immigration reform bill rather than continue to demagogue the issue ? as with the @entity186 , @entity35 are out of excuses			1
their stalling has worn thin			0
and the hour is late .			0

@entity191 : president @entity192 has no more excuse to not address immigration
@entity191 : he can use executive power to fix system and offer relief to undocumented
he says @entity35 also need to act ; they can work on a bill that reforms the broken system
