@entity0 -- world leaders met at the @entity0 on tuesday for the first day of debate at the 67th session of the @entity5			1
here are five things we learned : 1			2
the @entity9 conflict is at a stalemate , and the global community ca n't agree on how to stop the bloodshed			1
@entity0 @entity13 ban ki - moon opened the day with a strong condemnation of the 18 - month crisis in @entity9 , which has spiraled into a civil war			1
the situation grows worse by the day , he said , and is no longer limited to that country			2
" it is a regional calamity with global ramifications			0
this is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security , which requires @entity26 action , " he said			0
@entity13 's comments were no doubt directed at @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity26 members that have repeatedly blocked draft resolutions that would take strong action against the embattled government of @entity9 president @entity35			1
@entity37 president @entity36 described the situation in @entity9 as urgent , adding that @entity37 -- also a @entity26 member -- would recognize a new government as soon as it was officially formed			1
earlier , international peace envoy @entity41 said the conflict was at a stalemate			0
" there is no prospect for today or tomorrow to move forward			0
" @entity41 added that he has plans to meet with @entity29 and @entity30 leaders in an effort to forge a lasting solution , and that there were indications the country 's anti-government resistance is growing more unified			2
@entity54 may be running out for a two - state solution to the @entity58 - @entity57 conflict			2
@entity13 and others dived head - first into the controversial issue of @entity58 statehood			2
nearly a year after its failed bid to win @entity0 recognition as an independent state , the @entity63 is preparing to try again			1
but unlike last year 's attempt , which stalled in the @entity26 , the @entity63 is expected this time to seek nonmember observer status , one step up from its current status as a permanent observer			0
" the @entity58 must be able to realize their right to a viable state of their own			0
@entity57 must be able to live in peace and security , free from threats and rockets			0
the two - state solution is the only sustainable option , yet the door may be closing for good , " @entity13 said			2
president @entity82 called on world leaders to " leave behind those who thrive on conflict , those who reject the right of @entity57 to exist			2
" " the road is hard but the destination is clear -- a secure , jewish state of @entity57 ; and an independent , prosperous @entity93 , " the @entity89 president said			1
@entity95 's @entity94 urged both sides to resume full negotiations toward a lasting settlement			0
" for almost 65 years , the @entity58 people have been the exception of the @entity0 promise , " he said			1
" the shelter of international law and human rights , except not yet			0
" " enough , " he demanded			0
the @entity89 will " do what ( it ) must " to stop @entity108 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			1
delivering remarks thought to be as much of a warning to @entity108 as an assurance to @entity57 , which has repeatedly threatened a pre-emptive strike , @entity82 said he remains committed to a diplomatic solution to @entity108 's disputed nuclear program			1
but , he warned , " time is not unlimited			0
" " make no mistake , a nuclear - armed @entity108 is not a challenge that can be contained , " @entity82 said			1
" the @entity89 will do what we must to prevent @entity108 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			1
" @entity108 says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and to fill energy shortages , but @entity126 leaders believe @entity127 is an aspiring armed nuclear power			1
@entity0 inspectors have also expressed doubts about the program 's aims			1
secretary - general @entity13 said @entity108 must prove the " solely peaceful intent of its ( nuclear ) program			1
fault lines appear among nations in their reaction to the anti-islam film that triggered protests in the @entity142 world			2
several leaders addressed the inflammatory video that mocks the @entity145 as a womanizer , child molester and killer			2
the privately produced film sparked protests against the @entity89 , where it was made			1
while most of the demonstrations were peaceful , some were marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them @entity89 ambassador to @entity158 @entity157 and three other @entity89 killed in an attack on the consulate in @entity161			1
@entity163 president @entity162 opened his remarks by commenting on the film			1
" i want to express the strongest condemnation for the acts of incitement against the faith of billions of @entity170 of the world , and our beloved @entity145 , " he said			0
" although we can never condone violence , the international community must not become silent observer , and should criminalize such acts that destroy the peace of the world and endanger the world security by misusing freedom of expression			0
" @entity82 , who described the video as " crude and disgusting , " said he understood why people would take offense to it as millions of @entity89 did , too			1
he stressed the @entity89 had nothing to do with its production , but defended the right of such a film to exist and slammed the violent reaction to it			1
" i know there are some who ask why do n't we just ban such a video			0
the answer is enshrined in our laws , " @entity82 said			0
" there is no speech that justifies mindless violence			0
there are no words that excuse the killing of innocents			0
there 's no video that justifies an attack on an embassy			0
the crisis in the @entity211 region of @entity212 is " intolerable			0
" @entity37 president @entity36 spoke out from the lectern about the @entity211 , where a deadly mix of drought , famine and @entity170 militancy has unleashed a crisis			1
" the situation created by the occupation of territory in the north of @entity224 by terrorist groups is intolerable , " he said			0
the @entity226 has warned that more than 6 million people are at risk of hunger in the @entity211 region of @entity212 , including more than a million children exposed to severe malnutrition			0
@entity13 also addressed the @entity211 during his remarks , saying it " is not getting sufficient attention and support			0
" the two leaders met to talk about ways to forge a stronger response to the worsening crisis .			2
