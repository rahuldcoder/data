@entity0 -- two days after a @entity4 official told contractors that steps were being taken to shut down 168 air traffic control towers on april 1 , the agency gave the towers an unexpected reprieve friday , saying the official 's comments were " unauthorized			1
" in a telephone conference call on wednesday , an @entity4 official told contractors who operate the towers they would soon be receiving a letter giving notice that 168 towers would be closed on the first day of april because of government - wide spending cuts that were set in motion on friday night			1
another 16 towers would be closed on september 30 , the end of the fiscal year , the official said			0
but the news -- devastating to the three companies and hundreds of employees who staff the towers -- was short - lived			2
on friday , the @entity4 arranged a second conference call , retracting without explanation the earlier call , according to @entity33 , head of the @entity34			2
the contractors were told that the first call " was not an authorized call , " @entity33 said			0
the wednesday conference call " was n't just some coffee break conversation at the water cooler , " he said , saying it included @entity4 officials and representatives of all three contractors who operate @entity4 control towers in the @entity45			1
the move prolongs operation of the contract towers at least a couple of weeks , said @entity52 , head of @entity53 , who called the change " good news			0
" " it is my understanding that we will hear official news from the @entity4 in the coming days and coming weeks , and until such time we wo n't have any definitive guidance on whether or not our towers will face closure , " @entity52 said			1
said @entity33 , " quite frankly , i do n't think it changes the outcome			0
i think they 'll still be closing all these towers			0
it just may be on a different schedule			0
" while the @entity4 has said it may have to close more than 100 control towers , it has given few specifics			1
it has released a list of towers on a list of potential closings , targeting those with fewer than 150,000 aircraft operations ( take - offs and landings ) or 10,000 commercial operations a year			2
tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures , because some aircraft can land without @entity86 help , and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant @entity4 facilities			0
contract controllers are a widely used but little - known part of the @entity4 's air traffic control system			1
about 250 of the nation 's 374 towers are staffed by contactors , though they must meet @entity4 standards and are overseen by @entity4 managers			1
restricted to lower - volume airports , contract towers nonetheless handle 28 percent of all domestic airport operations			2
a 2011 report by the @entity103 's @entity102 said contract towers cost on average $ 537,000 a year to operate , compared to $ 2 million for comparably busy @entity4 - staffed towers			1
the lower costs were chiefly due to lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers			0
contract towers had an average of six controllers , while @entity4 towers had 16			2
and a typical contract controller near @entity113 received a base pay of $ 56,000 per year compared to a base pay ranging from $ 63,000 to $ 85,000 a year for an @entity4 controller in @entity117 , @entity118 , the study said			0
@entity33 said contract towers are carrying the brunt of the cuts , despite having comparable safety records and being more cost efficient			0
but the forced government spending cuts , known as sequestration , are also impacting @entity4 staff			1
most of the agency 's 47,000 workers , including its 14,700 controllers , have been told to expect one - or two - furlough days every two - week pay period			0
and 49 @entity4 - staffed towers are on the list of those facing possible closure .			1
