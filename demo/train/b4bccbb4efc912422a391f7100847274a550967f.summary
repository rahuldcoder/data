well , there 's one thing we can be sure of when the @entity5 nominations are announced thursday morning : @entity8 's " blended " wo n't get any love			1
other than that , the battle for nominations is pretty wide open			1
( yes , even " @entity14 " will probably pick up a nod in a technical category			2
) it 's a strange year for the @entity5 , where the divide between blockbusters and critic - friendly movies continues to grow			1
of all the likely major - category nominees , only " @entity22 " and " @entity23 " were $ 100 million - level box - office hits			1
the films that have dominated awards season -- " boyhood , " " birdman , " " @entity28 " and " @entity29 " -- have remained unseen by the majority of moviegoers			1
still , the @entity5 are as much a useful promotional exercise for little - seen films as they are a celebration of the booming blockbuster			1
( the actual @entity5 show is february 22			1
) with that in mind , here are our thoughts on who will make the final cut in the six major categories			1
best picture locks : " boyhood , " a coming - of - age story filmed over 12 years , and " birdman , " about a faded movie star mounting a @entity51 comeback and shot as if in one long continuous take , have drawn near - universal raves for their audacious filmmaking			1
" @entity57 " infuses a pivotal historical moment with fresh urgency			1
count on nods also for two well - made @entity61 period dramas , " @entity62 " and " @entity29			2
" ( under the @entity5 's confusing voting system , there can be between five and 10 best picture nominees , unlike the other categories			1
count on nods for eight or nine films			2
) contenders : the @entity71 ' love for @entity72 's " @entity28 " makes it a likely nominee			2
@entity76 's " @entity22 " has been a critical and commercial smash			2
" @entity78 , " based on a tragic true story , is respected but may be too downbeat for @entity5 voters			1
that leaves an opening for " @entity82 , " the riveting indie drama about a music student falling under the spell of an abusive mentor			2
wild cards : @entity90 's topical " @entity89 , " just hitting theaters this week , is gaining momentum			2
few people have seen @entity94 's crime drama " @entity95 , " but it 's getting strong reviews			2
then again , the @entity5 may want to lighten things up by honoring the star - studded @entity99 musical " @entity23			1
" best actor locks : @entity103 , in a career - defining role , will earn his first - ever nomination for " birdman			1
" he 'll be joined by three actors who brilliantly channeled real - life historical figures : @entity108 as disabled physicist @entity109 in " @entity29 , " @entity110 as a flesh - and - blood @entity111 in " @entity57 " and @entity113 as @entity114 , the closeted @entity116 codebreaker in " @entity62			1
" contenders : in the creepy - role acting sweepstakes , @entity119 's bloodthirsty tv cameraman from " @entity120 " may have the edge over @entity124 's homicidal millionaire in " @entity78			2
" but voters may prefer the surprisingly nimble comic skills of @entity127 , whose resourceful concierge held " @entity28 " together			2
wild cards : @entity130 bulked up to play a lethal but conflicted soldier in " @entity89			2
" and do n't forget @entity132 , who won best actor at @entity134 for his performance as the titular @entity61 painter in " mr. @entity137			2
" best actress locks : " @entity150 " has barely opened , and reviews have been mixed , but @entity141 , who plays a woman with early - onset @entity143 , has been leading handicappers ' surveys since it screened at the @entity149 film festival			0
@entity151 , who holds " wild " together , is also a sure bet			0
contenders : despite what @entity157 said at the @entity71 , rich leading roles for women are hard to come by in movies , which makes this category harder to fill than best actor			0
relative newcomer @entity162 will probably get in for playing the shifty wife in " @entity22			0
" @entity164 got a boost from her @entity71 for " @entity166			0
" @entity167 seems to be on everybody 's shortlist for " @entity29			0
" and @entity170 is earning good reviews for " @entity23			0
" wild cards : previous @entity5 winner @entity173 was brilliant in two movies : " the immigrant " and " two days , one night			1
" she may pick up a nomination for the latter			0
" @entity182 " earned respectful reviews , and two - time oscar winner @entity179 was singled out in many of them			0
@entity183 has been playing the publicity game -- and earning raves -- for " cake			0
" and what about @entity188 ? the @entity61 actress was great in " @entity190 " and " beyond the @entity191			0
" best supporting actor locks : we can start with @entity195 , who was given a terrific part as a brutal music instructor in " @entity82 " and played it to the hilt			0
we can also probably end with him , since he 's the odds - on favorite to win			0
contenders : but the category has to be filled out with five nominees , so for starters , look for @entity206 as a pompous actor who goes head to head with @entity103 in " birdman " and @entity211 as the good - hearted but sometimes absent father in " boyhood			1
" other possibilities are @entity215 , one of the wrestling brothers in " @entity78 , " and @entity218 , who 's been the only actor noticed in " @entity220			0
" wild cards : " @entity222 " received mixed reviews , but @entity225 's ramrod - straight cop got plenty of praise			0
@entity228 continues his good work as a character actor in " @entity95			0
" and for a real left - field pick , how about @entity231 as a slick lawyer in " @entity22 " ? sure , he may not have known who @entity76 was , but he did a splendid job under @entity76 's direction			0
maybe he even picked up a few directing tips			0
best supporting actress locks : @entity241 has earned much praise , and a @entity71 , for her struggling but empathetic mom in " boyhood			1
" @entity245 made a strong impression as @entity103 's bitter daughter in " birdman			1
" @entity249 will probably earn her annual nomination ( her 19th ! ) for a showy role as " @entity23 ' " singing witch			0
contenders : @entity254 ably crashed the all - male codebreakers ' club in " @entity62 , " while @entity257 was deeply affecting as @entity151 's dying mom in " @entity259			0
" wild cards : voters may want to reward @entity262 for her ruthless wife in " @entity95 " ( and , indirectly , for " @entity264 " )			0
@entity265 was superb as a desperate tv news producer in " @entity120			0
" and the always - memorable @entity267 has support for her fascist - on - a - train role in the overlooked " @entity270			0
" best director locks : @entity273 pioneered a new method of feature filmmaking with " boyhood , " and the gamble paid off			1
@entity278 brought a bravura style to " birdman			2
" contenders : this may finally be the year that quirky formalist @entity72 ( " @entity28 " ) gets in			0
the film won the @entity71 for comedy / musical , and he picked up a @entity288 nomination -- a key indicator , given that @entity5 nominations are voted on by peers			1
@entity292 has been the driving force behind " @entity57 " and would be the first @entity296 - @entity295 woman in this category			1
and @entity298 directed " @entity62 , " the kind of upright , @entity61 - flavored movie the @entity5 loves ... even though @entity298 is @entity302			1
wild cards : @entity90 earned a @entity288 nod for " @entity89 , " and he 's beloved by peers			0
two youngsters , @entity94 ( " @entity95 " ) and newcomer @entity307 ( " @entity82 " ) , could find support			0
and then there 's 84 - year - old @entity310 , the ornery @entity312 pioneer who 's never received a competitive @entity5 nomination ( he did get an honorary @entity5 in 2011 )			1
his film " @entity315 " was hailed at @entity134 , although @entity310 , being @entity310 , might just set his @entity5 nomination certificate aflame .			1
