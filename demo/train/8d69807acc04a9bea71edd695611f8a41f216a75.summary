-- when two - time winner @entity2 was forced to quit the @entity3 after a painful crash the outlook looked bleak for the @entity6 team but since his departure a new star has emerged in @entity10 rider @entity9			1
the 24 - year - old was a last - minute inclusion in its squad for the @entity3 , but has seized his opportunity with both hands , claiming his second stage win wednesday and the second in a row for @entity19			1
like teammate @entity20 the day before , @entity9 proved the strongest of a breakaway group on the short but punishing 124.5 km stage from @entity24 to @entity25			2
the points he gained on the climbs and at the finish saw him stretch his lead in the battle for the polka dot jersey of the @entity33 winner			1
@entity9 is one of a number of young riders making a big impression in the @entity3 , but it is still being led by @entity39 's @entity38 , who finished third on stage 17 , pulling away from his nearest rivals on the final climb			1
only @entity44 's @entity43 was able to hold his wheel to improve his chances of finishing on the podium in @entity48 sunday , holding fourth spot , but only eight seconds adrift of compatriot @entity50			0
@entity38 has extended his advantage to five minutes 26 seconds over @entity53 's @entity52 with one further tough stage in the @entity55 to come ahead of saturday 's individual time trial			2
with @entity2 and defending champion @entity59 sidelined by earlier crashes , the @entity58 star has dominated the race and looked untroubled again on the penultimate stage in the mountains			0
@entity9 , who finished sixth in this year 's @entity64 , first made his mark on the @entity3 in the @entity66 , winning at the @entity68 ski station last saturday in fine style , a major boost for his team after the loss of @entity2 to a broken shin on @entity74 , july 4			1
" our team had bad luck in stage 10 , but after that @entity80 ( @entity81 ) said that we needed to fight for a stage victory , " he told the official @entity3 website			0
" we did n't win one but three stages , and now with the polka dot jersey , i feel good			0
but there 's still one hard stage to go , i will fight more because this jersey is really important for the team			0
" thursday will see @entity38 and the rest of the peloton tackle the feared climbs of the @entity92 on a 145.5km leg from @entity94 .			0

@entity9 wins 17th stage of @entity3
