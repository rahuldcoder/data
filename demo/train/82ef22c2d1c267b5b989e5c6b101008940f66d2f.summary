-- highly - skilled foreign - born workers contribute more to the economy than they take away and unless the @entity4 government enacts immigration reform , the @entity4 " risks falling behing in the global race for talent , " according to a report released wednesday			1
the @entity10 on wednesday released its 2010 annual report			0
attached to the report was an essay authored by two economists who argue that that reform is needed to boost the legal immigration of highly - educated workers to the @entity4 " the disproportionate focus on illegal immigration is missing the picture that the legal system of immigration is broken as well , " @entity10 senior economist @entity18 told @entity0			1
" the cost of ignoring problems with the legal immigration of high - skilled workers in some respects is higher than the costs of illegal immigration			1
" @entity18 and @entity32 economics professor @entity31 co-authored the essay , " from @entity34 to @entity35			0
" the essay contains ideas included in a book the two economists co-authored for the @entity38 in 2010 , @entity31 told @entity0			0
the book is entitled " beside the @entity40 -- @entity4 @entity41 in a @entity42 of @entity43			2
" pointing to economic and census data , the authors say that skilled immigrants boost economic productivity and entrepreneurship			2
in highly technical fields , immigrants tend to complement @entity4 born workers by moving into expanding fields " where native labor supply can not keep up , " the author 's @entity10 essay states			1
immigrant entrepreneurs obtain patents at more than a two - to - one rate than native - born americans , according to @entity18 and @entity31 , and tend to boost " patent activity " overall			0
more highly educated immigrants also contribute more to government coffers than lower - educated workers drain from them , according to @entity18 and @entity31			1
the authors argue there is a line of approximately 1 million skilled - workers waiting on " employment - based " green cards from the @entity4 government			1
that 's because the number of permanent resident visas issued by the federal government has n't changed since 1996			0
" @entity77 numbers have given up on waiting or even applying , " the essay states			0
" for those in the queue , their applications have been approved , but their green cards wo n't be available for years because of strict numerical limits on employment - based permanent visas			0
" @entity18 and @entity31 also point out that @entity4 policy on granting green - card status to immigrants overwhelmingly favors relatives of @entity4 citizens , other legal residents or refugees			2
employment - based green cards for skilled workers and their families account for 15 % of the total issued by the @entity4 government every year , according to the authors .			2
