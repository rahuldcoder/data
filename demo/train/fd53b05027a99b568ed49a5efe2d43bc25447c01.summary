-- as we enter the final months of 2011 , the thoughts of tech watchers like me are turning to what we can expect in 2012			2
voice recognition in all our devices ? touch control replacing the mouse and keyboard ? the death of the wallet as mobile payments become mainstream ? maybe			2
but what i 'm most excited about is something far more audacious : flexible screens			1
expecting this much - anticipated technology to become widely available in 2012 is optimistic but not unthinkable			0
last week , @entity20 demoed a mindblowing prototype handheld device that lets you bend and twist the screen to complete actions like scrolling and zooming			1
meanwhile , @entity25 said on an earnings call last week that it expected to debut phones with flexible displays in 2012 and that flexible tablets would follow			1
the advantages of flexible displays are obvious : they 're more durable , and they pave the way for new input methods , such as bending the display to zoom			1
but where will this new tech take us ? i think this technology will lead to the biggest breakthrough in mobile devices since the touchscreen			0
in fact , the next innovation in screen technologies may be an even bigger leap forward than touch displays			1
think not of a bendable display but of a foldable one			0
you see , the biggest limitation of any device these days is screen size			1
there 's a constant tension at play : you can have a small screen that fits in your pocket ( your phone ) or a big screen for home use ( a tablet computer )			1
but you ca n't have both			0
or can you ? the ultimate dream for these flexible displays is that they could roll up : imagine a phone - sized device that could unfurl to be the size of a tablet			1
perhaps it would be like an ancient scroll , a tube that unrolls to create a full 10 - inch screen			2
or perhaps a phone display could expand in two directions , making it useable both when collapsed and when unfurled			0
ah , but why stop with our current form factors ? would n't it be wonderful if these devices could take forms more like the paper they replaced ? while the transition from newspapers , magazines and books to digital devices has led to a few compromises -- those tactile forms are all reduced to a rectangular square of glass -- flexible screens can mimic the paper they replace			1
e-book readers might simply become single sheets of digital paper			0
magazines and newspapers could be made up of multiple sheets that update their content wirelessly on a daily or even hourly basis			0
where flexible screens might have the biggest impact , however , is in their ubiquity			1
the @entity108 remains an expensive device , but that has n't stopped it popping up in unexpected locations			2
some hotels let guests check in on an @entity108 installed with a custom app or even borrow one for the duration of their stay			0
upscale restaurants are using @entity108 instead of menus			0
one auto enthusiast installed one as his in - car entertainment system			0
another put one in his kitchen cupboard , calling it a " kitchen entertainment system			0
" what will happen when screens are millimeters thick and virtually unbreakable ? simply put : the cheaper , thinner , more portable and more durable screens become , the more uses we 'll find for them			1
and what could be thinner or more durable than a flexible display ? any surface could -- and will -- become a screen			1
@entity136 released a video this past week imagining what will happen when every surface is a digital display			2
it 's an exciting future and one that 's rapidly approaching : if the device makers can pull it off , next year could see the launch of the first " bendable " phone			2
let 's hope so .			0
