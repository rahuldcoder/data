while some children whose mothers took the drug were born with one or more affected limbs , others suffered heart problems , damaged hearing or eyesight , and in some cases , brain damage			1
the drug was pulled from sale in late 1961 after doctors linked it to birth defects			2
@entity42 , the president of campaign group @entity26 , who was born in 1959 without arms or legs , said it was too little , too late			2

he expressed the company 's " sincere regrets about the consequences of thalidomide and our deep sympathy for all those affected , their mothers and their families			1
" @entity10 's nearly 50 - year delay in reaching out " person to person " to those affected was a result of its " silent shock " over their fate , he said			1
" instead , we have been silent and we are very sorry for that , " @entity73 said in a translated copy of the speech on the company 's website			0
many people have only recently started to receive compensation for the drug 's effects			1
more than 10,000 children worldwide are thought to have been affected by thalidomide			1

the company also pledged 50 million euros in 2009 to help more of those people affected in @entity6 and elsewhere , he said			0
" we see both the physical hardship and the emotional stress that the affected , their families and particularly their mothers , had to suffer because of thalidomide and still have to endure day by day , " he said			1
" we wish that the thalidomide tragedy had never happened			0
" personal account : a life shaped by bad medicine but @entity73 also pointed to how regulatory and testing organizations had changed since the 1950s			0
" the thalidomide tragedy took place 50 years ago in a world completely different from today , " he said			2
" the international scientific community , the pharmaceutical industry and governments , legislators and administrations have had to learn a lot from it			0
" @entity10 had " acted in accordance with the state of scientific knowledge and all industry standards for testing new drugs " that were current in that period , he said , and regretted that the drug 's potential to cause fetal malformations had not been detected			1
the drug was available over the counter in @entity6 from 1957 , under the name @entity24 , leading to more cases there than anywhere else , according to the @entity24 website			2
in @entity61 , where it was sold as @entity24 , it was a prescription - only medication			0
the drug was released only for clinical trials in the @entity158 , the @entity24 says , because of concerns following reports of certain side effects from @entity162			0
compounds that included thalidomide also appeared in a range of other medications , including some for asthma and migraine , the @entity24 says			0
it is still used to treat a handful of conditions including leprosy and multiple myeloma , a cancer of the plasma cell			0
@entity24 @entity26 urges strict controls to avoid the drug impacting unborn children			2
the @entity26 government allocated funds in 2010 to help those affected by thalidomide			0
