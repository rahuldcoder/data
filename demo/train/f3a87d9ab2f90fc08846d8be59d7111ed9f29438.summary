-- the @entity1 from @entity2 is the latest member of a new , multi-use generation of technology			1
it 's a book , it 's e-mail , it 's your social network or your office , it 's your music and your photos plus the apps for all of that			2
and the more ways we can use a device , the more we 'll want to take a look at how using it affects those around us			2
in a nutshell , that 's how " old " etiquette is applied to new technology			2
if you have an @entity1 , here are a few places you might find yourself : first , be prepared for jealous looks , curious stares and questions from strangers			1
do n't break it out in public unless you 're ready to play show and tell , and possibly share			2
" can i see it ? can i touch it ? can i try it ? " know your answer , because like a proud momma with a new infant , all the old ladies will want to hold your baby			0
have kids ? set the rules for use first thing			1
tell them it 's only for mommy 's or daddy 's work , or else be prepared to lose your latest spreadsheet when you walk in the door			1
back at the office , think about your work culture			2
will the @entity1 be a handy tool , mr. @entity53 , or overkill ? be explicit with colleagues about what you 're using it for , such as taking notes or checking a calendar , so they do n't think you 're playing online @entity60 during your morning meeting			1
the reading feature is a huge component of @entity1 use , so feel free to pull it out during your morning commute			1
the upside : no more awkwardly folding your newspaper into a postage stamp			0
the downside ? people are bound to read over your shoulder ; until @entity1 are ubiquitous , curiosity will draw wandering eyes			1
when you 're with your family , equate @entity1 reading to the same choices you make with your books and magazines			1
for example , if your family is watching " @entity81 " but it is n't your thing , and you 'd be reading a magazine during the show regardless , fire up the @entity1			1
just consider dimming it if the room is dark			0
but if the idea is to spend quality time interacting with your family , put it away			0
even if you think you 're paying attention , you wo n't look like it -- and that 's all that 's going to matter to your spouse			1
without question , turn it off at the dinner table			0
reading in bed is another time to think about dimming the @entity1			1
again , how will it affect others ? if their light is out , it 's time to dim			2
what about reading in the car ? it 's sad to have to spell this out , but never use it if you 're the driver ! causing an accident is the ultimate rudeness , to say the least			2
you know what else is rude ? getting carsick			0
no matter how excited you are to read the latest updates on @entity117 , the laws of physics still apply			0
have an iron stomach ? while catching up on " csi " may be a good idea , using headphones might be a better one if you 'll spoil it for the driver who ca n't watch			2
the internet abounds with free recipes , making the @entity1 handy in the kitchen			1
@entity128 fingerprints on your new gadget are n't so nice , however			1
if you share your @entity1 with someone else , wipe it down after kitchen use			1
as for the bathroom , this debate may continue to rage as it does now for magazines			0
but since the @entity1 's resting place in your home is n't likely to be the back of the toilet , this is the one time treating it like a magazine is n't such a hot idea			1
the @entity142 has already created a debate with its access to answers anywhere , anytime			0
need to know the capital of @entity147 to win an argument at the dinner table ? pulling out your @entity1 may win you the debate , but trumping others this way may come off a bit know - it - all			1
then again , it could be a huge success			0
the point of etiquette ? know your audience , and think before you trump			0
technology and etiquette have a fascinating intersection			0
etiquette lets people know how to act in common -- and sometimes uncommon -- situations , and how to expect others to react			0
but the pace of technology is blazingly fast and creates new situations daily			0
so we have to apply a basic tenet of etiquette -- be considerate of those around us -- to constantly adapt to how we , as a society , want to use technology			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

when taking out your @entity1 , be prepared for jealous looks , curious stares and questions
free recipes make the @entity1 handy in the kitchen , but *greasy* fingerprints are n't nice
have kids ? set the rules for use first thing : tell them it 's only for your work
