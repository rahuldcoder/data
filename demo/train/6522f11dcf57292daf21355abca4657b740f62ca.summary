well , that escalated quickly			2
in fairness to my conservative friends , there 's noooooo way they could have ever known that their newest hero , @entity8 rancher @entity7 , would let loose a racist rant			1
it was unimaginable , crazy			2
who 'd have thought ? sure , he refused to recognize the legitimacy of the federal government , also known as the @entity14			2
but so did the secessionists of @entity17 's time , and they were n't racists			1
no , not at all			2
they just believed that some people should own other people and that the determining factor in deciding whether you were master or slave was the color of your skin			2
besides , by what right does the federal gubmint own that land in @entity8 ? other than the fact that the federal government bought it and paid for it in 1848			1
) that does n't mean it 's " theirs " or anything , does it ? @entity7 said of blacks , " i want to tell you one more thing i know about the @entity41			1
they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton			1
and i 've often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? they did n't get no more freedom			1
" on thursday , he defended his remarks			0
" i do n't think i 'm wrong , " @entity7 told @entity61 's @entity60			1
" i think i 'm right			1
" so who can blame poor @entity63 for looking like a right - wing blockhead for promoting the cause of a guy who turned around and said crazy , racist things ? well , i can			0
let me tell @entity63 about the @entity69 : the @entity69 hates federal subsidies			0
not the subsidies that provide grassland to @entity8 ranchers at below - market values			0
nor the subsidies that bring water to the desert by , say , building @entity77			0
nor the subsidies that benefit mining operations in the @entity8			0
no , the @entity69 hates subsidies that sap the human soul : like food stamps for moms with hungry children			0
especially if those moms happen to be , well , differently pigmented from him			0
politicians denounce @entity7 's racist remarks that 's what 's so interesting , not about this racist moron but about the @entity90 who supported him until he revealed his views on slavery			1
@entity7 was plainly a nutcase , and the right - wing pundits and politicians should have seen that			1
he should never have been portrayed as a hero or a victim or anything other than a lawbreaker , a freeloader , a moocher			0
for two decades , he grazed his cattle on land that did not belong to him and refused to pay the landowner			2
right - wingers , one would think , would hate that			0
he refused to respect law enforcement , in fact threatened to take up arms against the peace officers whom @entity90 usually trip over themselves to honor			1
i thought conservatives believed in law and order			0
what if , instead of being a right - wing rancher who flouted the law , @entity7 was the leader of a left - wing group of college radicals who occupied a government building ? @entity124 notoriously said of @entity126 protestors , " if there is to be a bloodbath , let 's get it over with			1
no more appeasement ! " or what if @entity7 had been the leader of the @entity132 ? what if he and his followers had , for 20 years , brazenly stolen from the federal government , refused to obey court orders and threatened police with guns ? would @entity63 have been duped into defending him ? fat chance			1
or , umm , what if @entity7 had been a @entity141 , declaring a tiny caliphate on that dusty piece of @entity8 ? does anyone really think @entity145 would have made a hero of him then ? @entity7 : another conservative folk hero exposes racial nerve @entity7 's status as a deadbeat welfare queen should have been sufficient for the likes of @entity63 to know better than to support him			1
his threats of violence against @entity14 law enforcement personnel should have had @entity63 up in arms			0
instead , the right - wing noise machine once more looks like a bunch of dupes and dopes , blindsided when their newest hero turns out to be a racist			0
it wo n't be the last time this happens			2
join us on @entity167 / @entity166 .			0

@entity169 wonders why *republicans* who championed @entity7 were *surprised*
a few @entity90 *initially* rallied around @entity172 in *dispute* over land
@entity7 wondered this week of blacks , " are they better off as slaves , picking cotton ? "
@entity7 told @entity61 , " i do n't think i 'm wrong . *...* i think i 'm right "
