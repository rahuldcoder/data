well over a year after @entity3 voluntarily imposed a ban on pork barrel spending , the number and cost of earmarks have dropped dramatically , a report said tuesday -- but the snouts are not out of the trough altogether			1
the 2012 database of pork - barrel projects compiled by the nongovernmental group @entity11 , known as the @entity12 , says @entity3 has some way to go to cut out wasteful spending			1
it finds that the number of earmarks has decreased by 98.3 % from 9,129 in fiscal year 2010 , when the @entity12 was last produced , to just 152 in fiscal year 2012			1
the cost has also plummeted by 80 % , from $ 16.5 billion in 2010 to $ 3.3 billion in 2012 , the lowest sum in a decade , it says			0
numerous pet projects still found their way into appropriations bills despite the supposed moratorium on earmarks , the @entity12 's authors say -- and despite @entity3 certifying each appropriations bill as earmark - free			1
citizens @entity11 acknowledges that its criteria for what constitutes an earmark differ from those of @entity3			0
the report comes amid a political furor over allegations of lavish spending on conferences and rewards programs by the @entity39 , a government agency			1
earmarks , which are federal funds that members of @entity3 direct to specific projects back home , were common practice for years but have become a target for budget - conscious deficit hawks			2
those detected in 2012 " involve larger amounts of money and include fewer details than in prior years , " the @entity12 says , with a side effect of the moratorium being that pork barrel spending is much harder to spot			1
" the supposed lack of earmarks resulted in a completely opaque process			2
since earmarks were deemed to be non-existent , there were no names of legislators , no information on where and why the money will be spent , and no list or chart of earmarks in the appropriations bills or reports , " the report says			1
" while the lower number and cost of earmarks are a vast improvement over prior years , transparency and accountability have regressed immeasurably			1
" the @entity12 highlights several earmarks slipped into the defense appropriations bill , including $ 255 million to upgrade the @entity79 tank , a project opposed by the @entity81 ; $ 239 million for cancer research that is already funded elsewhere ; and $ 50 million for @entity84 state plans			1
it also flags $ 9.5 million for high energy cost grants , $ 3.4 million for national fish hatchery operations and $ 3 million for aquatic plant control as among the " most blatant examples of pork			1
" but as part of an overall downward trend , the appropriations bill for @entity92 , @entity93 saw a huge decline in earmarks , from 1,789 in 2010 to three in 2012			2
one of those that made it through was $ 5 million for abstinence education			0
only one earmark showed up in the 2012 financial services appropriations bill , the report says , down from 270 in the 2010 financial year			2
that was $ 38.5 million for a drug trafficking program at the @entity108			0
four earmarks were spotted in the @entity112 and @entity113 appropriations bill , the report says , including $ 114.8 million for the @entity114 , despite the @entity116 administration never requesting funding for it			2
another is a $ 5.9 million award for the @entity120 in @entity121 , which its authors flag as a home - state project of @entity125 chairman @entity124 , @entity121			0
earmarks have typically accounted for less than 1 % of the budget			0
but critics say the funding awards do not undergo the same scrutiny as other spending and tend to reflect the influence individual lawmakers wield in @entity3 , rather than merit			0
while some lawmakers have called for legislation to be passed to turn the moratorium into a permanent ban on earmarks , others oppose that step			0
the report names @entity124 ; senate majority leader @entity144 , @entity145 ; @entity125 ranking member @entity146 , @entity147 ; and @entity125 appropriator @entity148 , @entity149 , as among those critical of the continuation of the moratorium			0
citizens @entity11 suggests that until a ban is imposed , " taxpayers will be justified in their belief that members of @entity3 are being creative and deceptive in skirting the moratorium and continuing to obtain earmarks			0

the number of earmarks has fallen dramatically for 2012 , the @entity12 report says
some earmarks are still finding their way into spending bills despite a voluntary ban
a tank upgrade program and fish hatchery projects are examples highlighted by the report
the supposed ban on pork barrel spending has *damaged* transparency , its authors say
