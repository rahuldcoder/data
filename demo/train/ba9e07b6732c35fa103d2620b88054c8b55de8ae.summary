-- if the reports of a proposed $ 13 billion settlement between the @entity6 and @entity7 are correct , the public and the company 's shareholders will not see justice done			1
while the tentative deal is being portrayed as a larger settlement , it really represents the company coming forward with an additional $ 9 billion			1
the other $ 4 billion represents loan workouts that @entity7 would do anyway to reduce its losses on mortgages that would otherwise cause it greater losses through foreclosure			1
from the perspective of the company 's shareholders , the problems amount to an even bigger loss because of alleged fraud			2
the full $ 13 billion would represent a loss to the shareholders , and @entity7 estimates its future increased legal and investigative costs for its past scandals at $ 9.2 billion			1
and so , it will cost @entity7 's shareholders heavily to buy what could well be a " get out of jail free " card from @entity6 for wrongdoers at @entity7 and the banks it purchased			1
while the reported settlement would n't close down a federal investigation based in @entity37 , it remains to be seen whether it will target any current employees of @entity7			1
a settlement of this kind would release @entity7 and its officers from civil and criminal liability for a wide range of alleged frauds			1
many of these alleged frauds added to the profits of @entity7 and the companies it acquired			1
the shareholders should not be enriched by fraud			0
where officers ' frauds created profits that enriched the shareholders , @entity7 should fire such officers , and the @entity6 should prosecute and recover any fraud proceeds			1
@entity7 should pay the damages it caused to others through fraud			1
in cases where a firm 's senior officers engage in a wide range of frauds , the courts should award punitive damages against the officers and the firm			2
@entity69 : five things to know about @entity72 settlement the problem in terms of justice is when the frauds created fictional profits that enriched corporate officers through unjust bonuses but also created real losses that were booked by the company years later			1
the shareholders suffer twice from such frauds -- they paid the unjust bonuses and then have to bear the losses			1
the shareholders ' losses are compounded by the legal fees , which are primarily driven by the desire to keep the officers from being prosecuted or their unjust bonuses recovered , and by the fine			2
the appropriate policy would be for @entity7 to fire such officers and for @entity6 to prosecute them and recover their unjust bonuses			1
there is a triple failure of accountability for officers of @entity98 companies			0
@entity6 failed to prosecute any elite @entity98 banker for the frauds that drove the financial crisis			0
the banks have failed to fire and " claw back " the compensation of the officers who led these massive frauds			0
we can not deter frauds when we do not prosecute them , fire those responsible or recover the wealth they gained through fraud			0
@entity7 's supporters argue that the settlement is unjust for two reasons			1
first , they argue that @entity6 is engaged in a " vendetta " designed to shrink @entity7 's size to the point that it no longer poses a " systemic " risk to the global economy			1
@entity119 , a @entity98 analyst , made the vendetta and shrinkage claims without presenting any supporting evidence			0
i wish that it were true that the @entity126 government was requiring the systemically dangerous institutions ( the " too big to fail " banks ) to shrink to the point that their failures will no longer cause a global financial crisis			2
the @entity133 and @entity134 administrations have refused to require these huge institutions to shrink			0
the @entity136 does not require them to shrink and though it gives the regulators power to require these companies to shrink , they have refused to use the power			0
no @entity6 settlement requires any of these institutions to shrink			0
@entity145 , @entity7 's ceo , was an early and strong supporter of president @entity134 ( though he became critical of the administration subsequently ) , so he is an unlikely vendetta target			2
second , @entity7 's supporters argue it is unjust for the @entity6 to hold @entity7 financially liable for the damages caused by the frauds of the two enormous failed banks it acquired : @entity152 and @entity153			1
it 's true that the @entity133 administration did encourage @entity7 to buy @entity152 and @entity153			2
the owners are liable for the liabilities of companies they buy			0
any other rule would leave victims of misconduct and fraud unable to recover their losses			0
@entity145 knew that acquirers of failed banks can refuse to buy unless the @entity167 agrees to bear the banks ' liabilities for fraud			0
@entity145 appeared eager to buy @entity153 and @entity152 despite their terrible reputations and their collapse			0
@entity152 was notorious in the finance industry , inspiring the phrase : " @entity174			0
" yet @entity145 chose not to insist that the @entity167 retain the banks ' fraud liabilities or indemnify @entity7 against losses because of those alleged frauds			2
first , the purchase price would have increased substantially if the @entity167 had to bear the banks ' fraud liabilities			0
second , @entity145 knew that if the @entity167 offered broad indemnification , rival banks could outbid @entity7 and buy the banks			2
without doing the due diligence essential to judging the banks ' fraud liabilities , @entity145 likely decided that the purchase prices were so low that it was better to buy them immediately without indemnification			0
it would be unjust to allow @entity145 to change the deal five years later because his business decision proved disastrous			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity7 is reported to be in talks with @entity126 over $ 13 billion settlement
@entity193 says if reports are correct , the public and shareholders will not see justice
reports say @entity37 criminal probe will continue , but it 's not clear what may result , he says
black : shareholders pay bonuses to execs who profit from frauds , then pay the fines
