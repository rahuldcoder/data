-- after @entity2 was killed , the chorus was loud among those who felt video evidence would illuminate what happened between the unarmed teen and officer @entity7 on august 9			1
they asked : why did n't @entity7 have a body camera ? following the grand jury 's wednesday decision not to indict officer @entity12 , who , on camera , used a chokehold on @entity15 that 's banned by the @entity16 , a different question emerged : what 's the point ? president @entity20 has called for 50,000 body cameras for police officers			1
@entity24 mayor @entity23 has called for officers to wear them as well , but skeptics were out in force on @entity29 after the grand jury 's decision in @entity15 's death			1
" body cameras on cops are n't going to change anything			1
" there was clear footage of this cop killing @entity15 , cop still was n't indicted			2
" " introducing police body cameras will do nothing , , , this was on camera ! " read another tweet			1
asked about @entity20 's plan , @entity15 's dad , @entity46 , also expressed doubt , telling @entity0 , " throwing money away			1
@entity50 did n't matter here			0
" camera phone footage shows @entity15 , whom police accused of illegally selling single cigarettes , arguing with two officers			1
the 350 - pound man tells the police he 's minding his business			2
he 's clearly upset , gesticulating as he accuses officers of previous harassment			0
" i 'm tired of it			0
this stops today , " he tells them			0
" i did not sell nothing			0
" as the two officers reach for his arms to make an arrest , he pulls away , telling them , " do n't touch me			0
" @entity66 administers the chokehold after two more officers appear , and within nine seconds , they take @entity15 to the ground			2
a fifth officer joins the fray as @entity66 forces @entity15 's head into the sidewalk , eliciting repeated , muffled cries from the 43 - year - old , " i ca n't breathe			1
when it was announced @entity12 would n't be indicted , people took to @entity29 to question the usefulness of body cameras if a grand jury wo n't indict an officer who was caught on video using a maneuver banned by his own police department			1
this is an even more pointed question when you consider a statistic from the department 's own @entity88 : despite the @entity16 banning chokeholds in the 1990s , @entity24 officer was accused of putting someone in a chokehold , on average , every other day from 2009 through the first half of 2014 ( you can see the numbers for yourself on page 55 of the board 's report )			1
of those 1,048 complaints , the review board substantiated only 10 , and at the time of the board 's report , only one officer had been charged and only one had been disciplined , with a " loss of up to 10 days of vacation " ( three of the 10 were still " pending disposition " at the time of the report )			2
following @entity2 's shooting , body cameras became cause du jour			1
sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , said in august that if local police agencies want to qualify for federal funding , their officers should be required to wear body cameras , and @entity20 said he would ask for $ 263 million that would , in part , provide police departments with the recording devices			1
@entity0 and @entity126 ran numerous stories under headlines such as : -- " can cell phones stop police brutality ? " -- " no dashcams in @entity132 : one less tool in @entity2 shooting investigation " -- " @entity136 , more police uniforms include cameras " -- " can technology prevent another @entity132 ? " yet all this clamoring to put cameras on officers ' lapels ignores that police use of force has remained relatively static despite the increasing popularity of camera phones over the years			1
cell phone companies began equipping their devices with cameras in the @entity149 in 2002			0
they 've proliferated since , but according to @entity158 , reports of police using force or threatening to use force barely budged , from 1.5 % of those who had contact with police in 2002 , to 1.6 % in 2005 , to 1.4 % in 2008			2
it important to note that juries are asked to hold police officers to a different standard than civilians			0
in 1989 , the @entity164 decided in @entity165 that a police officer 's use of force should be " analyzed under the @entity167 's ' objective reasonableness ' standard , rather than under a substantive due process standard , " under which the average @entity149 's actions would be gauged			1
the ruling requires juries to determine whether an officer 's actions were " ' objectively reasonable ' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them , without regard to their underlying intent or motivation			2
" it also demands juries consider that a " reasonable officer " is " forced to make split - second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation			2
" twenty - two months later , the country watched home video of four @entity195 police officers using a stun gun on @entity197 and hitting him more than 50 times with batons			2
in april 1992 , an all - white jury acquitted three of the officers , while it was hung on the fate of the fourth officer , resulting in a mistrial			2
fast - foward to 2014 , and in addition to @entity15 's death you have more instances in which seemingly excessive force caught on tape did n't result in a conviction for the accused officer			1
a grand jury declined to indict an @entity215 police officer who killed 22 - year - old @entity216 in august as he walked through a @entity217 carrying an air rifle			1
the @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 stood by officers who in march shot a mentally disturbed , homeless 38 - year - old , @entity223 , in the back after hours of negotiation in which @entity223 wielded two small camping knives			0
police then released a dog and fired bean bags at him as he gasped for breath			0
a county and federal investigation are ongoing			0
police in @entity236 , @entity237 , also stood by officers who smashed the passenger window of a car and used a stun gun on @entity242 in september after pulling over his partner , @entity243 , for a seat belt violation			0
police say @entity242 refused to identify himself and exit the car , leading them to believe he was armed			0
at the same time , there are instances in which police departments did not stand by their officers when cameras captured what appears to be excessive force			1
" why did you shoot me ? " begged @entity255 , 35 , in september after a @entity257 state trooper asked him for his driver 's license and opened fire when he reached into his car for it			0
@entity264 was fired and charged with aggravated assault and battery , the @entity263 said			0
a witness said @entity268 , @entity24 , deputy @entity269 hit a man in the head last month after the man told him he did n't want his car searched			0
@entity269 was caught on tape cursing at the man and telling the witness , who recorded parts of the incident , " i 'll rip your f * * * ing head off			2
" @entity269 , who has resigned , was charged with official misconduct and second - degree harassment			0
the facts , along with these incidents -- and the disparity in how the cases were handled -- do n't appear to provide a solid answer on whether body cameras are the answer to curbing excessive uses of force by police in @entity149			1
in fact , they seem to demonstrate that these are complicated issues that wo n't likely be resolved by a simple camera on a cop 's lapel			0
@entity0 's @entity300 contributed to this report .			0

@entity116 senator , president @entity20 lead calls for police body cameras
death of @entity15 , caught on video , raised question : what 's the point ?
