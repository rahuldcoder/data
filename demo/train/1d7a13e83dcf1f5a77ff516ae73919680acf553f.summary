-- @entity3 has promised to give @entity2 $ 50 million to replace money that the @entity5 said this week it would withhold from the @entity7 country , @entity2 president @entity1 said saturday			1
@entity2 president @entity1 expressed disappointment in @entity5 president @entity11 's decision			1
@entity3 president @entity12 promised the aid after @entity1 learned that the @entity5 was canceling $ 62 million of aid that was to have come from the @entity15 , a @entity5 - government - funded anti-poverty fund set up by former president @entity18			1
@entity1 expressed disappointment in president @entity11 for the decision			1
" he expresses good will , but in practice , he has the same policies as president @entity30 , " @entity1 told a crowd of supporters in @entity25 's @entity24			1
in 1982 , then - president @entity30 supported funding the contras , the forces opposed to @entity1 and his socialist @entity33 , which had come to power after overthrowing the @entity5 - backed @entity35 in 1979			1
@entity1 called this week 's decision not to follow through on the payment " disrespectful			1
" " the @entity5 had given its word to the people of @entity2 and in particular to the people of the cities involved in the program , " he said			1
wednesday 's decision to cut the funds altogether came after the @entity5 announced last november that it was suspending aid to @entity25 in the wake of what it said were fraudulent municipal elections			1
@entity1 , whose party members won most of the mayoralties , disputed that			2
and he warned his @entity5 counterpart that the world has changed since the @entity5 funded the contras			2
" he is the first to know that the @entity5 of today is not the @entity5 of 20 , 30 , 40 years ago , " @entity1 said			1
" today , the @entity5 can not do whatever it wants in the world			2
it does n't have the moral force , even though it may have the material force to do it			0
they have even lost the support of the @entity5 people			2
" still chafing over his loss to @entity65 , who replaced him as president in 1990 , @entity1 said those were the elections that were fraudulent			2
he said president @entity69 affected the outcome by telling the @entity2 , " if you vote for the [ @entity33 ] front , the war is going to continue ; if you vote for the enemies of the front , go in peace			0
' that was the promise that @entity18 made			0
" he described that pact as " a big lie , since the peace was already coming			0
we , the @entity2 , were making peace			0
" what @entity18 then wanted , @entity1 said , was war throughout @entity7			2
" he fed the war in @entity86 , he fed the war in @entity88 , he fed the war in @entity2 , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 described the three @entity5 - backed governments that ruled @entity2 from 1990 until 2007 -- when he reclaimed power -- as anti-democratic			1
" they robbed the people of the right to health , the right to education , the right to decent housing , " he said			0
" they privatized energy industry , the telecommunications industry , the businesses of the workers -- those were nothing more than acts of corruption			0
" and he said that the $ 62 million would have been used to build 12 highways , not to support his government			1
but work that has begun on two of the roads will be completed , said @entity113 , deputy ceo for the @entity15 in an interview friday with @entity0 en @entity115			0
he denied any suggestion that the money was being used for political ends rather than simply to alleviate poverty			0
" that 's totally false , " @entity113 said , adding that his corporation 's funds are doled out regardless of a government 's leftist , centrist or conservative policies			0
" we want a clean government , " he said , adding that because the elections were not clean , " we had to act			0
