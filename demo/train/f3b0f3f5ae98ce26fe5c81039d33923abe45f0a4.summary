-- the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting from the @entity4 will be commemorated by this year 's @entity5			1
a hundred years after the start of the global conflict and the first battle of @entity11 , the @entity7 town will host stage five of cycling 's blue - riband event			1
during @entity4 there were three battle at @entity11 , with over 900,000 @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 casualties			1
it is a nod by @entity22 to a conflict that had a major bearing on the race			0
for four years -- from 1915 to 1918 -- the race was cancelled while some of its first overall victors lost their lives in the war , namely @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			2
the modern - day focal point for @entity11 violent past is the @entity37 , completed in 1927 , and a memorial to the @entity18 and @entity40 soldiers that lost their lives in what today is a relatively sleepy town with a population of just 35,000 people			1
" we of course can not forget them			0
the tour is also a moment of collective remembrance , " said @entity5 director @entity47			0
from a racing perspective , the stage could have a significant impact on the race as it boasts nine cobblestone sections along part of the route of the classic day race @entity59 , often referred to as " the @entity60 "			1
the last time the @entity5 visited sustained periods of cobbles during the 2010 race , it resulted in a litany of crashes and the exit of some notable @entity5 contenders , namely @entity69			0
when defending @entity5 champion @entity70 was asked to come up with is ideal @entity5 route last week , he admitted he wanted plenty of time trials and no cobblestones			1
revelation of this 2014 route -- starting in the @entity18 town of @entity78 and finishing in @entity79 -- was not quite the antithesis of the defending champion 's dream tour but there was a sense organisers were perhaps trying to halt the @entity18 hegemony and a possible hat - trick of @entity18 winners after @entity89 success in 2012			1
the route boasts just 33.5 kilometres against the clock -- the smallest amount for 80 years			2
that said , it comes on the penultimate stage , thereby giving @entity96 one final throw of the dice should he have a deficit to make up			0
more precariously lying in wait is the aforementioned cobblestones			0
prior to the route announcement , @entity70 had said : " what worries me about cobbles are the crashes , the mechanical problems			2
a mechanical problem in the wrong moment of the race when things are kicking off could lead to you losing the @entity5			0
" i 'm not a big fan of that			0
it 's the unknown factor that worries me about the cobbles			0
" more positively for @entity70 is the volume of mountainous terrain scheduled for the route			1
this summer , he showed he was comfortably the best climber in the field , so the 2014 race 's five mountain - top finishes should play to his strengths			2
this year , the @entity124 first lies in wait , some of it familiar territory for @entity70 , including @entity129 , scene of his first stage win in the @entity5			1
arguably the toughest terrain , however , is the @entity134 stages that follow			0
for the second time in the race 's history it will begin in @entity18 , this time in the county of @entity139 , the @entity140 ( the official start of the race ) taking place in its major city @entity78			2
@entity70 's defence of the yellow jersey , handed out to the @entity5 leader , is likely to come notably from this year 's runner - up @entity148 as well as @entity151 @entity150 and former winner @entity152			1
sprinter @entity153 will be hoping to add to the @entity18 success on home soil by winning the first stage in @entity157 where his mother lives .			0

@entity161 for @entity160 is *unveiled* at *glitzy* *ceremony* in @entity19 *capital* @entity79
@entity11 to be remembered 100 years after start of @entity4 with stage start
defending champion @entity70 wary of the cobblestone *nature* to the route
just one 33.5 - kilometre time trial on this year 's very mountainous scheduled route
