-- two @entity2 athletes issued angry denials tuesday that their exchange of a kiss on the victory podium at the world championships was a protest against their country 's strict new anti gay propaganda law			1
@entity11 and @entity12 were part of the @entity2 quartet who won the women 's 4x400m relay saturday in the @entity18 , beating the favored @entity20 team			1
all four embraced as they received their gold medals , but @entity11 and @entity12 were pictured kissing each other on the lips , prompting reports that it was a symbol of defiance in face of the controversial new laws			1
@entity11 told a media conference in @entity31 that she and the three other members of the team had merely been overcome with emotion after finally topping the podium after a series of near misses			1
" for eight years we have not won a gold medal			1
you ca n't even imagine what it was like , when we understood that we 'd won , " she said , addressing reporters in @entity2			2
" it was a wave of unbelievable feelings and if somehow , completely by chance , while we were congratulating each other , our lips touched , i do n't know in whose fantasy this all gets thought up			0
" she added : " @entity52 and @entity12 are both married and we are not having any kind of relationship			2
" earlier in the championships , @entity2 's pole vault gold medal winner @entity55 defended the new legislation , speaking in @entity59 at a press conference			1
" if we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street , we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal , standard people , " @entity55 said			0
" we just live boys with woman , women with boys			0
" she also criticized two @entity71 competitors who had painted their fingernails with rainbows in support of gay rights , claiming them to be " disrespectful			0
" @entity55 , an ambassador for the @entity76 in @entity77 , later back tracked and said her comments had been " misunderstood " as @entity59 was not her first language			0
they prompted a storm of international criticism , but @entity12 claimed tuesday that she had not been aware of the controversy			2
" i simply did not hear or read about it because i was totally focused on my performance at the championships , " she told gathered reporters			0
both @entity2 athletes complained that the media spotlight on their kiss had taken the shine off their victory celebrations			1
" these victories are hard to come by and we were happy			0
i do n't understand how everything could be tarnished in such a way , " @entity12 said			2
the legislation banning the promotion of " gay propaganda " among minors came on to the @entity2 statute book in june as @entity102 embarks on his third term as president			1
it has prompted calls for a boycott of the @entity76 and the 2018 @entity108 , which is also to be staged in @entity2 .			0
