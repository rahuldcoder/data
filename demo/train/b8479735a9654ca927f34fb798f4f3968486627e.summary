on thursday , the 35 - year - old actor appeared to take a stand against the @entity7 and its theater critic , @entity8 , after the paper ran a hesitant review of @entity2 's @entity12 debut in an " @entity14 " revival			1
in the april 16 piece , @entity8 called " @entity14 's " opening night on wednesday " respectable " and " respectful , " but also " generally inert			1

@entity8 wrote that the two leads , who star alongside @entity28 , " wear their archetypes like armor			0
" and while the production would make " an excellent audiovisual aid for middle - school instructors who are teaching ( @entity18 ) @entity20 's novella , " @entity8 believes " habitual theatergoers ... should n't expect the kind of revivifying interpretation that makes revisiting a classic feel essential			0
" @entity2 has been blissfully promoting his turn in " @entity14 " for weeks , and seemed pretty excited to both land the part and read the reaction to it			2
following " @entity14 's " opening night , the actor shared @entity44 's more favorable review , which credited director @entity17 for " an impeccably mounted production " and praised the ensemble acting as " flawless			1
" but @entity2 was vehement about the @entity7 ' take			2
" sadly @entity8 and the @entity7 have embarrassed themselves , " @entity2 said in an @entity49 post that has since been removed			1
" @entity8 is such a little b * * * * he should be working for @entity51 instead of the paper of record			0
the theatre community hates him , and for good reason , he 's an idiot			0
" the remarks have since been removed from @entity2 's account , but not before they were screengrabbed for posterity			1
