-- it took more than 20 years to get an answer for the injustices i suffered as an unfairly paid worker , so i know what it 's like to wait			2
but the six seconds of silence from @entity10 's campaign recently seemed like forever			1
@entity10 's advisers held a conference call inviting reporters to ask questions			1
one was simple and straightforward : " does gov. @entity10 support the @entity15 ? " in other words , when a woman is paid less than a man for doing the same work , does the presumptive @entity21 nominee support her right to fight for the equal pay she 's guaranteed under the law ? that 's exactly what the bill that bears my name ensures -- it simply gives workers a fair shot to make their case in court			1
it 's not a hypothetical question			0
women get paid just 77 cents for every dollar a man gets			0
that means a woman would have had to work from january 1 , 2011 , until this tuesday to match what men earned in 2011 alone			0
@entity10 's team has certainly had enough time to think about its candidate 's positions -- he 's been running for president for six years -- and about the law in question , which was the very first one that @entity51 signed as president more than three years ago			1
but @entity10 's team drew a blank			1
when an adviser finally piped up , it was n't to answer the question			2
it was to tell the reporter , " we 'll get back to you on that			0
" the @entity21 nominee for president does n't know whether he supports the principle of equal pay for an equal day 's work ? he needs some time to think about it ? what an insult			1
@entity10 then went on national television , where @entity72 asked him if he would have signed the bill into law			1
he still would n't give a straight answer , saying that he had no " intention of changing that law			1
" in other words , he ducked the question			0
for all we know , had the @entity82 bill crossed @entity10 's desk instead of president @entity51 's , @entity10 would have vetoed womens ' right to fight back			1
and if a future @entity21 @entity86 tries to repeal the @entity82 law , we do n't know whether @entity10 would let it			1
if the @entity89 , which goes even further to outlaw gender discrimination in the workplace , reached his desk , we do n't know whether he would stop it			0
while @entity10 decides whether he opposes gender discrimination , here is an important reality he should consider : this is n't just about women			2
it 's about all families and their economic security			1
the consequences of unequal pay reach far beyond the paychecks women take home every week			2
my pension and @entity106 were based on an unfair salary , so over the course of my career , i was cheated out of hundreds of thousands of dollars that could have gone to my kids ' education or my family 's medical bills or to support the shops and small businesses in my community			0
i also worked countless hours of overtime , but the extra pay i earned was based on the same uneven scale			0
the question @entity10 's campaign could n't answer is a question of fairness and whether @entity125 workers have a level playing field on which everyone has the same opportunity to get ahead			1
i know @entity51 believes in those values			0
as the grandson of a woman who worked in a bank long after she hit the glass ceiling -- and who was paid less than the men she trained -- he believes equal pay is an essential right			0
as the father of two girls , he cares deeply about making sure the work force they 'll join one day is n't slanted against them			0
but i have no idea where @entity10 stands -- and from the sound of it , neither do those closest to him			2
what we do know about whom and what @entity10 supports is even more unsettling than his silence on this issue			2
@entity154 gov. @entity153 recently took away citizens ' rights to fight workplace discrimination			0
@entity10 called him a " hero " and a " man of courage			2
" he 'd also repeal @entity51 's health reforms and bring back the discriminatory days when being a woman was considered a pre-existing condition , which means insurance companies could charge us more than men for the same coverage or deny it to us altogether			0
when combined with pay inequality , @entity10 's promises would mean women would earn less income and then be forced to pay more for basic health care			1
that 's devastating for our families and the economic security of the middle class			1
anyone who wants to be president of the @entity125 should n't have to think about whether hardworking , responsible middle - class families deserve the opportunity to succeed			2
we know all too well what it 's like to hear silence when we fight for fairness -- and we 've heard enough			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity82 .			0

@entity10 's campaign drew a blank when asked if it supports the @entity15
@entity82 : it 's insulting that @entity10 would n't give a straight answer on whether he would sign the law
she says pay equality is not just about fairness , it 's about economic security for all families
@entity82 : @entity10 's positions would mean that women would face economic *setbacks*
