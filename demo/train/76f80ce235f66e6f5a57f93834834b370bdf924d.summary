@entity0 -- the death of @entity3 is an undeniable tragedy			2
people are outraged , and rightly so , because a young , unarmed teenager lost his life			0
the incident has brought @entity9 's " stand your ground " law into sharp focus in the center of a media and legal firestorm			1
the shooting of @entity3 was not something that the @entity19 anticipated would happen when it enacted the law in 2005			2
when the law was pushed through the legislature , its supporters , including the @entity23 , proclaimed it as necessary to give law - abiding citizens the ability to protect themselves			1
the law expanded an individual 's legal right to use force , including deadly force , in self - defense			1
and it allows it in any place , not just in one 's home , without fear of civil or criminal consequences when the individual has a " reasonable " fear of death or great bodily harm			0
the @entity23 lobbied hard for the law in @entity9 , which passed the @entity47 and @entity48 with almost no opposition			1
based on its resounding success in @entity9 , the @entity23 lobbied for similar legislation in many other states			1
the vast majority of these acts also passed			0
one can not entirely fault the @entity23 for supporting the bill			0
simply put , it 's good for business			0
as people are encouraged to purchase and use firearms to protect themselves , presumably more guns are purchased and more individuals join the association			0
however , it 's becoming increasingly clear that the ramifications of the law are murky			0
in hindsight , it 's easy to say the @entity19 should have been troubled by the law when it was introduced in the state			0
and that more attention should have been paid to law enforcement officers and prosecutors who strongly opposed it			1
now , these people 's fears have proved to be well - founded			0
for police and prosecutors , the law causes confusion as to when prosecution is appropriate			0
the statute has led to many nonprosecutions after investigations -- it is hard to find that a person did not act in self - defense when the person that was being defended against can not refute the allegations , i.e. , dead men do n't talk			1
many blame the present lack of prosecution in the @entity3 case on the law			2
@entity98 's belief in his right to use a firearm in self - defense against @entity3 is difficult to dispute			1
and legally , the police can not simply arrest and prosecute him for @entity3 's death			2
so the question remains : is the law working for the residents of @entity9 and other states ? the answer depends on your perspective			2
more cases result in no prosecution because of the law , and the law has led to a variety of wins for defendants on motions to dismiss before a trial by jury			0
potential defendants and their attorneys undoubtedly see this as a positive change and certainly there are instances where the use of force in self - defense is warranted			1
but this expanded right to self - defense comes at a price -- more individuals are likely to use deadly force because they feel protected by the law , and more innocent people who may have been in the wrong place at the wrong time are likely to die or be seriously injured as a result			1
@entity3 's death highlights the potential deficiencies and problematic aspects of the law			1
let 's hope it will force the @entity19 and legal system to face these difficult gray areas in what perhaps seemed like a straightforward law when it was passed			2
regardless of how the facts of the @entity3 case play out , lawmakers and the public that elects them should consider whether the law is a benefit to all citizens			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

@entity9 's ' stand your ground ' law permit citizens to use force in self - defense
@entity167 : @entity23 had reasons to support the law
@entity159 : law officers who opposed the measure should have gotten more attention
he says given the tragegy of @entity3 , we need to *reconsider* the law
