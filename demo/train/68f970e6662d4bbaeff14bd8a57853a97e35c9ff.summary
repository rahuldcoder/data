@entity0 -- initial legal challenges to the government 's sweeping electronic surveillance programs began to emerge with one couple alleging they were singled out for monitoring because they criticized the @entity9 military			1
a $ 3 billion class - action complaint by @entity11 and @entity12 of @entity13 was believed to be the first civil case against the @entity16 administration since last week 's blockbuster disclosure in published reports about the super-secret @entity20 surveillance efforts			1
the disclosures in the @entity23 newspaper and the @entity24 have outraged civil libertarians , political liberals and some conservatives , and triggered new policy and privacy debates			0
but legal challenges are expected to be uphill fights in federal court			1
the @entity35 ' suit and another by civil liberties groups this week centered on phone monitoring in which the @entity20 is said to have received data from a major telecommunications company			1
" this dragnet program is surely one of the largest surveillance efforts ever launched by a democratic government against its own citizens , " said @entity40 , said legal director for the @entity47 , which joined with the @entity48 in filing suit			1
they argue the program , which the @entity52 says is carefully and lawfully applied and a necessary tool in fighting terrorism , violates the @entity56 free speech rights as well as the @entity57 right to privacy			0
no sign of @entity20 leaker as @entity9 investigation builds steam the complaint also charges the initiative exceeds the authority that @entity66 provided through the @entity67 , which was a response to the september 2001 @entity70 attacks against the @entity9			1
the @entity35 ' son , @entity73 seal @entity71 , was killed in a 2011 helicopter crash in @entity75			0
along with the government watchdog @entity76 , the @entity35 say their phone records were illegally accessed by domestic spy agencies because they " have been vocal about their criticism of president @entity16 as commander - in - chief , his administration , and the @entity9 military			1
" a former @entity20 computer contractor , @entity85 , has admitted to leaking details about government surveillance activities , telling a @entity89 reporter that @entity90 was ordered by a secret federal court to turn over details of phone calls published from april 25 to july 19			1
intelligence officials later confirmed the program , which analysts say likely covers all @entity9 carriers			0
that disclosure and a second involving @entity20 surveillance of e-mails have reignited debate about government collection of personal data in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals			1
civil liberties advocates say the measures are unacceptable intrusions			0
but supporters say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped stop terror plots			2
the @entity35 have sued @entity16 , attorney general @entity113 , @entity20 director @entity114 , @entity90 , government agencies and the judge who signed the secret order on phone monitoring			1
@entity52 has tough questions about secret surveillance in the complaint , the couple claims their privacy and free speech rights were compromised by the alleged " criminal acts			2
" the alleged surveillance " violated plaintiffs ' and class members ' right of freedom of association by making them and others weary and fearful of contacting other persons and entities via cell phone out of fear of the misuse of government power and retaliation against these persons and entities who challenge the misuse of government power			2
" the lawsuit offered no specifics of any targeted surveillance			2
the @entity35 based their allegations on " information and belief			0
" they previously filed a lawsuit against the government over the @entity75 copter crash that killed 38 people			0
@entity12 , 25 , and fellow members of his elite @entity156 were killed , along with other @entity157 , @entity158 , and @entity75 military troops			0
the @entity160 and other families of those killed have alleged a government cover - up , questioning the official story of the incident			0
the @entity35 say that questioning has made them targets for surveillance			2
there was no initial response to the surveillance lawsuit from administration officials , including the @entity171			0
@entity172 head @entity172 said in a statement it was necessary to hold the government accountable			0
" we can not allow a ' @entity177 , ' orwellian government spy on the @entity9 people to access their confidential communications to effectively turn ' citizens into its prisoners			0
" that is why this class action lawsuit , which all @entity90 users are welcome to join , no matter what their political persuasion , will serve as the vehicle for a second @entity9 revolution , one that is carried out peacefully and legally , but also forcefully			0
" other lawsuits over the @entity20 surveillance program could be filed in coming days by other telecommunications customers			1
the @entity47 , other privacy advocates and individual telecom customers have challenged various @entity20 programs in the past , but have not been successful in federal courts			1
the @entity198 in february blocked a lawsuit over sweeping electronic eavesdropping on @entity9 potentially linked to suspected foreign terrorists and spies			0
the @entity13 case is @entity172 v. @entity16 ( 1:13 - cv - 851 )			1
second term mostly drama for @entity16			2

@entity13 couple , @entity47 file lawsuits over surveillance
court complaints involve @entity20 phone monitoring
legal challenges expected to be uphill fight in federal courts
president @entity16 says surveillance necessary and lawful to fight terror
