a much - used -- and thus often misused -- moniker that anoints the something or someone that greets the status quo with a seismic blow so great that the game is placed on a new , irreversible trajectory			1
the internal combustion engine , for example , was a game changer			0
electricity , @entity14 and @entity15 were game changers			0
and longtime @entity18 anchor @entity17 was also a game changer			1
if you find that proclamation a bit hyperbolic , it 's only because you either did n't know or have forgotten how sports anchoring sounded before @entity17 's arrival at @entity18 in 1993			1
@entity26 brought personality to the field			1
@entity29 , @entity30 and others smashed glass ceilings			0
@entity33 and @entity34 brought jovial irreverence			1
but it was @entity17 who looked at the profession and doused it with hot sauce			1
as hip - hop was shoehorning its way into mainstream , @entity17 -- with his " @entity43 " fade and urban vernacular -- was one of its leading ambassadors			1
though he was so much more than a young black sports anchor at the right time at the right place			1
he was a workhorse , a personable interviewer and a nimble reporter			1
the creative insight wrapped around one of his popular catchphrases , " as cool as the other side of the pillow , " showed he was a talent who did n't sacrifice journalistic integrity just to bring barbershop talk to television			0
his humorous flashes of black @entity66 did n't appeal to everyone and his critics were not shy about sending him letters to let him know			0
but for those of us who longed for a soundtrack to accompany the soul of the new generation of black athletes who were redefining how big - time sports were played , @entity17 was a welcomed and masterful composer			1
and the music he made was a sound that today is repeatedly mimicked			2
sometimes by earnest youngsters who have no idea who dared to change the game , like someone 's classic hip - hop playlist without the @entity85			1
my friends and i watched @entity17 in college at night and would use his catchphrases -- such as " booyah " -- to trash - talk each other on the court the next day			1
when i was offered a job at @entity18 10 years ago , meeting @entity17 was one of my top priorities on my list			1
and when i finally did get to introduce myself , i was so nervous , i tripped over my own name			0
this was before his first cancer diagnosis in 2007			2
our first meeting was brief but his advice was long lasting : do your homework and be yourself			0
each time i saw @entity17 after that , he did n't just greet me with a smile , he met me with infectious joy			1
this , even after the cancer had returned			2
" when you die , it does not mean that you lose to cancer , " he said at the @entity109 's last july			2
" you beat cancer by how you live , why you live , and in the manner in which you live			2
" there are not many of us who have not been intimately touched by this terrible disease			0
some have lost mothers , sisters , daughters			0
others forced to say goodbye to fathers , brothers and sons			0
we fundraise through local @entity126 , wear yellow , @entity129 wristbands or find something pink to wear in october , all to let cancer know it will not win			2
i was not a close friend of @entity17 's , but i can tell you whenever i spoke with him , he was the embodiment of this spirit			1
never pity , always fighting			0
perhaps spending 20 years at @entity18 encountering some of the greatest champions in the history of sports influenced his approach to his own battle			2
maybe his demeanor was just a natural reflection of who he was , considering he played club football at the @entity145 and " game recognizes game " was one of his on - air sayings			2
or maybe he knew we were all watching and he never wanted to let us down			0
the way he knew being one of but a handful of black men on primetime television in the early 1990s , we were all watching			0
the way he knew young journalists roaming the halls at a @entity161 conference were watching			0
the way he knew aspiring journalists and sports fans everywhere were watching			2
and listening -- to the songs only he could write			0
to the music only he dared to play			0
like many of my @entity18 colleagues , i am deeply saddened by his passing			0
but there is comfort in knowing each time a sports anchor tries to add a little somethin ' - somethin ' to their report , we can still hear his voice .			1

@entity180 : @entity17 brought the sound of hip - hop to the sports anchoring world
a personable interviewer and nimble reporter , @entity17 fought cancer *bravely*
