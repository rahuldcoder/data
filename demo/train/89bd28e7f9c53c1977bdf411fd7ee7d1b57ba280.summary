homeland security secretary @entity0 has something to say to people contemplating illegal migration to the @entity4 : " we 'll send you back			1
" deportations will begin this week , he said			0
it 's a message the @entity9 administration wants to amplify more loudly now that it is wrestling with a huge influx of minors crossing the southern border -- 57,000 in the past nine months			1
they 're from troubled @entity15 countries and a lot are unaccompanied and many of those are young children			1
it 's all overwhelming already stressed immigration services as more and more kids find themselves caught in a bureaucratic limbo and a political firestorm			1
reforming an immigration system most in and out of @entity25 agree is broken is an all - but dead legislative issue in @entity27 now with midterm elections around the corner			0
but there is growing pressure on both to address the current influx of minors			1
@entity9 has asked @entity27 for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to fortify the border patrol and strengthen other programs for dealing with those crossing into the @entity4 illegally			2
but the @entity39 - led @entity38 is not expected to move fast on it and does n't want to give @entity9 everything he wants			0
some say tweaking a 2008 law combating immigrant trafficking might be enough to stem the flow			0
overwhelmed facilities the political wrangling is all going on as new arrivals make their way to detention facilities like the one @entity0 visited in @entity50 , @entity51			1
it currently houses about 400 immigrants , with more expected to arrive friday night			0
the @entity38 has called the situation a " humanitarian crisis			0
" @entity39 prefer to call it one of the @entity9 administration 's making , and blame it for not being prepared and for an underwhelming response			2
they liken it to the debacle associated with the underwhelming federal response to @entity64 in 2005 that was a nadir for @entity9 's @entity39 predecessor , @entity65			0
but the administration says the influx was unexpected and that inaction by the @entity39 - led @entity38 on a bipartisan immigration reform plan approved by @entity70 has held up improvements that could be applied in this case			1
@entity9 himself resisted calls , predominantly from @entity76 gov. @entity75 and other @entity39 , to visit the border during a trip to the @entity76 this week			2
he declined , saying that he was working on the problem and was n't interested in " photo ops			0
" 7 questions on immigration @entity0 , instead , showed up and delivered @entity9 's message			1
" our message to those who are coming here illegally , to those who are contemplating coming here illegally : ' we will send you back , ' " @entity0 said			1
" people in @entity15 should see and will see that if they make this journey and spend several thousand dollars to do that we will send them back and they will have wasted their money , " he added			1
the @entity51 facility visited by @entity0 opened june 27 at the @entity98			1
it 's capable of housing 700 people , and is being used now for adults and children who arrive as family units			0
they are subject to " expedited removal			0
" the vexing problem involves unaccompanied children , who have arrived in unprecedented numbers this year from @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
many are fleeing violence and other hardships			0
but others , especially @entity39 , tie the influx to @entity9 's 2012 decision to ease deportations for children already in the country illegally			2
@entity0 said his agency is working to dispell " misinformation " by smugglers that the @entity4 is giving a " free pass " to migrants			1
" i think it 's fair to say that a good number of ( the migrants at the @entity50 facility ) were surprised that they were being detained , " @entity0 said			2
" i think that they expected to be apprehended and simply let go into the interior and they 're surprised they 're being detained and they 're being send back so quickly			2
" the @entity38 is promising due process , but @entity9 said on wednesday that most would likely go back			2
@entity9 did meet with those hecklers what @entity9 can and ca n't do on immigration			0
