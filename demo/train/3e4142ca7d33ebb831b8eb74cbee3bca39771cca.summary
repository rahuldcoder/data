-- the story has become a clich√© when talk turns to young people and the internet : a young adult posts pictures of a beer - soaked keg stand on @entity9			1
( in this modern - day parable , it 's always a keg stand -- a means of guzzling beer directly from a keg -- and always @entity9			0
) potential employer goes online and finds the photo			1
young person does n't get the job			1
@entity20 , 26 , figures this fictional over-sharer probably does n't deserve the job			0
but not for the reason you might think			0
" i think the employer is more likely to judge you for not understanding the ( @entity9 ) privacy settings than they are for doing the keg stand , " said @entity20 , who edits local news sites in @entity26 , @entity27			1
" if you 're concerned about what 's out there , you make sure nobody can find you by googling you			1
" it 's a point that highlights one facet of the digital world 's complex set of views about privacy			2
often , younger users -- the so - called " digital natives " who have roamed the web for as long as they can remember -- are less worried than older people about their privacy online			1
but it 's not because they do n't care about protecting their information			0
in many cases , experts say , it 's because they understand how to control it better than older users			1
to them , it 's easy to pick and choose what to share , how to share it and with whom			2
" i do n't really see the big deal in it , " said @entity59 , 20 , a @entity60 junior currently studying in @entity61			0
" we know how to operate the system			0
" to be sure , concerns about how much personal information can be accessed on the @entity44 are real , as advertisers , social - networking sites and even criminals look for data to use -- and sometimes abuse			1
but research from @entity74 seems to show privacy concerns actually declining as people grow more comfortable with the internet			1
in a @entity74 survey released in may , 33 percent of respondents said they were worried about how much information is available about them online			1
that 's down from 40 percent in 2006			0
only 30 percent of users between 18 - 29 said they were worried , the lowest of any age group except for people 65 and older , who may worry less because they do n't use the internet much , if at all			1
again , @entity74 notes that not being worried does n't necessarily mean no desire for privacy			1
" it is important to note that the results from this question are not a measure of internet users ' overall views on ' privacy ' or the extent to which they wish to have control over their personal information online , " the report reads			1
" a relative lack of concern about the availability of personal information online does not necessarily translate into inaction			2
indeed , many of the least concerned internet users have still taken steps to restrict what they share with others			1
" in fact , the youngest internet users were the most likely to have protected themselves on the @entity44 , with 44 percent saying they had taken steps to limit information about themselves			1
still , the stereotype exists that sites like @entity9 and @entity119 are a font of digital data that bad guys use to pilfer personal details			2
and young folks , the thinking goes , are all too happy to spill their most intimate details			2
" it 's the end of privacy only if people are stupid enough to post their personal information on sites like @entity9 , @entity134 , @entity119 , and all those other useless social - networking sites , " one reader posted this week on an article in @entity0 's digital - privacy series			2
" most of the social - networking stuff is crap			0
people want to feel important by constantly updating their sites to tell the world what they had for breakfast , what movie is really , really cool , and if they had diarrhea last night			0
" @entity146 , a 42 - year - old professor of new media at @entity149 's @entity148 , compares views like that to another social phenomenon : rock ' n ' roll			0
you know , that noisy fad created by untalented cretins bent on leading the world 's youth to hell ? just like some adults did n't get the appeal of @entity163 and @entity164 in the ' 50s and ' 60s , some do n't get @entity119 and @entity166 now			2
" whenever young people are allowed to indulge in something old people are not allowed to , it makes us bitter , " @entity146 said in a @entity168 article titled " @entity169			2
" " what did we have ? the mall and the parking lot of the @entity178 ? it sucked to grow up when we did ! and we 're mad about it now			0
" people are always eager to believe that their behavior is a matter of morality , not chronology , ( but ) you did n't behave like that because nobody gave you the option			0
" researchers say that older users , who have spent most of their lives without social - networking sites , often have to overcome privacy fears in a way that younger users do n't			1
older users are the fastest - growing segment on sites like @entity9			1
but many remain mistrustful of such sites , perhaps because of the sometimes - complicated measures that protecting privacy requires			2
in a @entity0 article last year , @entity202 , then 61 , said she uses @entity9 , but has a hard time convincing friends to join her , in part because they 're worried about scams			0
" it 's a little bit more difficult for older people , " she said			2
a survey conducted this spring suggested that much of the backlash over @entity9 privacy changes earlier this year came from adults over the age of 35			1
@entity217 , a social - media researcher for @entity218 , predicts that the stereotype of young people oversharing online may be starting to fade			1
" i think that , a few years ago when this concern was really at a peak , the people who were judging young people for their online information practices were n't really using social media themselves , " she said			1
" as we see more people in their 40s and 50s and 60s get involved ... i think we 're going to see much less of this generational schism than we do today			0
" @entity231 is quick to point out , though , that age might not be the best way to judge attitudes , and aptitude , regarding digital privacy			2
" someone 's level of education , their access to technology in the home -- those types of things are going to have more of an effect on their comfort level than their age , " she said			0
and while many young adults may be among the most savvy internet users , she said research shows that many teens , and even younger web users , may not always understand online privacy and still sometimes share things without understanding the possible ramifications			1
experts say that 20 - somethings like @entity59 and @entity20 are more comfortable with today 's internet because they 've never known it any other way			0
so , while a 40 - something web user may feel squeamish about @entity9 ads triggered by things they " like " or @entity269 programs scanning their e-mails for keywords , 20 - somethings consider it par for the course			0
" i do n't think those are that annoying -- they 're just something we have to live with , " said @entity59 , who started using message boards and web chat rooms when he was about 10			0
" we 're exposed to ads so frequently that i almost do n't even see them any more			0
" @entity20 , who was 2 when her family first got a computer , said she 's not bothered by the targeted ads either			0
at least , not yet			0
" not until they track me down and knock on my door and ask if i want to buy a @entity285			0

experts : young adults are less concerned than older adults about privacy online
@entity74 research shows concerns about online data *dipping* , with youngest users least concerned
researcher says teens and younger users still might share without understanding
