-- following the attempt to bomb a passenger jet on christmas day , president @entity1 said that " once the suspect attempted to take down @entity6 , it 's clear @entity7 and @entity8 took all appropriate actions			1
" i am a commercial airline pilot who was deep over the @entity12 flying from @entity13 and @entity14 for nearly six hours on christmas day following the attempted bombing on @entity6			1
i only learned about the incident after landing when i looked at the @entity0 web site on my @entity19			1
i 'm justifiably furious that i was not notified while airborne			2
our government clearly dropped the ball			1
president @entity1 has ordered a review into the intelligence failures leading up to the attempted @entity26 bombing by @entity27 , but an equally important review needs to be made into how events were handled once @entity27 attempted to carry out his plan			0
specifically , why were n't the actions the @entity32 outlines in our aviation manuals initiated , and what took place inside the federal @entity36 in the immediate aftermath of the terror attempt ? following the 9/11 review , the @entity36 was given the task of instituting new procedures for controllers on how to communicate information about suspicious aircraft throughout the system			1
the @entity47 - based @entity46 is supposed to allow federal agencies with jurisdiction over the security of @entity52 airspace to communicate information in real time			0
so why , after eight years and billions of dollars , was the information concerning the incident available to me only on my @entity19 ? like many commercial pilots , i flew in the military			1
there , each squadron maintains something called a pre-mishap plan			0
basically , it 's a three - ring binder with a series of actions the watch officer is supposed to take when a mishap happens			0
it 's a very useful tool -- but only if the officer who is assigned to carry out the plan is familiar with the binder 's contents			0
good commanding officers run simulated mishap drills within their squadrons to ensure their junior officers effectively execute the plan			0
i 'm left with the sickening sense that after 9/11 , the government spent horrific amounts of money to create the " mother of all " pre-mishap plans , but never effectively tested it			2
why ? because unlike the military , where commanding officers rise up through the ranks based on professional competency , our government operates on a different model			2
how else does one explain the failed governmental response to natural disasters like @entity93 , or man - made disasters like the christmas day bombing attempt ? the silver lining is that @entity27 's failed attempt gave us that test of the response system			0
it can only be attributed to luck that unlike 9/11 , this was not a coordinated attack involving multiple aircraft			1
now that the gaping holes in our response have been exposed , let 's do a thorough review of what took place on @entity6 and ensure we have professionals in decision - making positions who will execute the plan if this happens again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity116 .			2

airline pilot @entity116 was flying over @entity12 during bomb attempt but was n't notified
he only learned about it after landing " when i looked at the @entity0 web site on my @entity19 "
writes " government clearly dropped the ball " after the incident as well as before
@entity116 : only luck that this was not a coordinated attack involving multiple aircraft
