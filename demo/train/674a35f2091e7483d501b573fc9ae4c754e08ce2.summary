-- @entity1 is expected to announce his vice presidential running mate any day , and the certain @entity5 nominee 's campaign is asking supporters to download " @entity1 's vp " app , which has the primary purpose of sending a push notification with the name of @entity1 's choice to users before the official announcement to the press			1
for the impatient , the @entity18 president blog has brought up an interesting possible early indicator : activity on potential picks ' @entity23 pages			0
in the past , @entity23 activity has spiked for vice presidential picks the day before an official announcement was made			1
in 2008 , hours before @entity5 candidate @entity28 announced his vice presidential choice , @entity31 's wikipedia page was getting a heavy edit			1
according to the @entity36 , the then - @entity35 governor 's page was changed 68 times the day before the announcement			2
in the 24 hours leading up to @entity41 's running mate announcement , @entity39 's page was edited 40 times			1
while there 's no official list of people being considered by the @entity1 campaign , a few names have been bouncing around , including @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
the @entity18 president looked at @entity23 activity for these and other potential choices on monday , and though it found some interesting numbers , no one page has yet seen the one - day levels of activity experienced by @entity31 's and @entity39 's in ' 08			2
on monday , @entity58 rep. @entity51 had the most changes with 10 , but on tuesday , @entity60 sen. @entity48 took the lead with 16 changes made by a @entity23 user called @entity64			1
the anonymous user deleted a section on controversies , a paragraph about @entity69 and various criticisms of @entity48			0
when the seemingly biased edits were noticed , other @entity23 users organized on @entity74 message boards and acted to revert the changes and lock the page to prevent more tweaks			0
@entity78 was flagged by @entity23 for having a " possible conflict of interest			0
" @entity49 's wikipedia page was also quite active on tuesday , and the comments on the changes are an interesting peek at the @entity87 senator 's supporters and detractors			0
the primary argument was over whether to include a quote calling @entity49 the " crown prince of the tea party movement , " with some tea party members disputing the title			0
recent @entity23 edits could be the work of hopeful candidates wanting to look better to the @entity1 campaign as it deliberates ( though a presidential candidate likely uses more than @entity23 to vet vice presidential running mates )			1
it is also possible the @entity1 campaign has learned from the past coverage of @entity23 edits and will only make changes gradually leading up to an official announcement .			2

in past *elections* , @entity23 edits have served as *signal* for vice presidential picks
edits seem to *increase* right before a candidate is announced as running mate
sen. @entity48 's page had a spike in *favorable* edits on tuesday
