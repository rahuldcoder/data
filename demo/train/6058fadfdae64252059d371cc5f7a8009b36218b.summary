-- @entity3 prince @entity2 , one of the world 's richest men , thursday excoriated a young woman model whose accusation that he raped her was dismissed a day earlier by a @entity9 court , the prince said in a statement			1
@entity11 said the court ruling " dismissed the totality of the claims by the self - described victim			1
" " in doing so , the court engaged in a disciplined factual analysis which eviscerated her credibility , pointing to a multitude of inconsistencies , the absence of any corroborating evidence of her continuously changing story and the fact that all the physical evidence , including a physical examination by an independent physician after the night in question and the report of an independent toxicologist , contradicted her claims of assault and drugging , " the prince said in a statement thursday			1
@entity11 said the conduct of the model , her lawyers and her mother were " particularly blameworthy			2
" " the model and her mother have admitted that they only learned of hrh @entity2 by searching the internet for ' @entity50 , ' yet even then , as the @entity51 pointed out , they did not identify hrh prince @entity2 as her alleged attacker , an outrageous defect which , the court agreed , ' infected the whole investigation ' , " the statement from the prince 's office said			1
" their accusations varied wildly each time they were recounted in the proceedings and the press , in both @entity9 and @entity63 , " the prince said			1
" after the model , her mother and her lawyers learned along with the rest of the world that @entity2 prince @entity2 had been in @entity71 at the time of the alleged events , they deliberately initiated a relentless public attack on hrh @entity2 through a public relations campaign involving multiple interviews , calls to reporters , and television appearances , all in an attempt to harm hrh @entity2 through the media , " the prince said			1
the young woman had alleged that the prince raped her on a yacht on the island of @entity86 in 2008			1
on wednesday , a @entity9 court in @entity88 found there was n't sufficient evidence to press charges			1
the prince , who was never formally charged in the case , has long maintained that he is innocent , that he has n't been in @entity86 in more than a decade and that others have tried to impersonate him			0
in september , a @entity9 court reopened the investigation into the rape allegation			1
the woman filed her complaint in @entity86 in august 2008 , but a local judge shelved it in 2010 , citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed , according to court documents			2
the woman appealed to the next highest court , the @entity51 , which ruled the lower court in @entity86 should reopen the investigation			2
according to court documents obtained by @entity0 , the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the @entity3 royal family			2
in september , the @entity3 prince , a billionaire and the biggest foreign investor in companies such as @entity120 and @entity121 , said in a statement that he was just learning of the accusation			1
" these allegations are completely and utterly false , " said the statement from his investment firm , @entity125			0
" the alleged encounter simply never happened			0
" according to the september statement , the prince does n't vacation in @entity9 waters			2
but @entity132 , one of the lawyers for the alleged victim , said last year there was evidence his team had wanted the court to examine further			2
according to the court documents , the woman believed her drink had been drugged			2
she sent a text message to a friend stating as much			0
she awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as the prince , according to court documents			0
@entity132 said " there were remains of semen " that should be examined against the prince 's dna , as well as " remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had			0
" the evidence came from tests carried out 30 hours after the alleged rape , the attorney said , so any alcohol was gone from her body , but not the drug or the dna			0
in september , @entity132 said the alleged victim 's mother could answer questions from @entity0 , but only through e-mail			0
he provided responses to questions that he said were from the mother			0
@entity0 could not independently confirm the message was from the victim 's mother			0
" she wanted to reopen the case due to the huge injustice and a feeling of a helplessness ; powerful people should not take undue advantage of it and have others subjected to them , " the message said			0
the message described the " man or men " who allegedly abused the young woman as powerful individuals who threatened her onboard the yacht			1
asked if her daughter was afraid to appeal the case , the mother said , " part of the fear has a lot of dignity and that ca n't be bought nor scared off with threats			0
" the young woman , a dual @entity9 and @entity63 citizen , was 23 in september , the e-mail said			1
@entity0 's @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity9 , contributed to this report .			0
