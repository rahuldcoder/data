-- two leading tobacco companies fired a pre-emptive legal strike against federal authorities friday , challenging the objectivity and thus validity of a 12 - member advisory panel charged with making recommendations on the safety of menthol cigarettes and other matters			1
the @entity11 , which is helping direct the implementation of the 2009 @entity13 , is set to file a key report on menthol by march 23			1
just over a month before that report comes out , @entity16 and @entity17 filed their lawsuit friday in @entity20 in @entity21 , naming the @entity22 , @entity23 and those agencies ' respective leaders as defendants , as well as the director of the @entity28			1
the complaint attempts to prevent federal authorities from " taking any action based on or influenced by " or otherwise using information from the advisory committee " as it is currently constructed			2
" that group , which includes three non-voting members representing the tobacco industry , is charged per federal statute with providing " advice , information , and recommendations " to secretary of health and human services @entity38 on health , dependence and other issues related to tobacco			0
theoretically relying on these recommendations , the secretary has the authority to mandate " good manufacturing practices for tobacco products			0
" the lawsuit filed friday questions the neutrality of the panel members , saying three -- including its chairman , dr. @entity53 -- had " conflicts of interests and associated biases that are incompatible with ( the committee 's ) role as an impartial advisor			1
" the tobacco firms allege that the three , plus two members of a subcommittee , have been paid expert witnesses in litigation against tobacco companies and / or consultants for pharmaceutical companies that create nicotine - replacement - therapy products			1
@entity70 , a spokesman for the @entity22 , did not address specific claims in the suit			0
" as a matter of general policy , the @entity22 does not comment on possible , pending or ongoing litigation , " @entity70 wrote @entity0 by e-mail			1
according to the panel 's website , most of the committee 's voting members " shall be physicians , dentists , scientists or health care professionals practicing in the areas of oncology , pulmonology , cardiology , toxicology , pharmacology , addiction , or any other relevant specialty			1
" one must be a local , state or federal government official and one who is a representative of the public			0
before the report 's release late next month , the panel has two scheduled upcoming meetings			0
it has met approximately once a month since june 2010 , with transcripts , webcasts and documents germane to the sessions posted on the @entity22 website			0
the tobacco companies in their complaint noted the panel 's mission to probe menthol cigarettes , including their use among young people , african - americans , @entity115 and other minorities , as well as smokeless tobacco products			1
menthol cigarettes , which account for one - quarter of the cigarettes sold in the @entity120 , have been under scrutiny by public health officials and public health watchdog groups			2
critics claim the flavor makes them more addictive and they denounce the marketing campaigns that they say target menthol cigarettes specifically at minority smokers			2
according to a study published in the journal @entity134 and @entity135 , three - quarters of @entity131 smokers prefer menthol cigarettes to traditional ones			2
but @entity137 , director of marketing at @entity17 , said last year that " ethnicity does not play a role " in marketing strategies for the @entity142 menthol cigarette			0
" we do n't collect or retain information on ethnicity in our marketing data base , " he said			0
@entity16 , the nation 's second - largest tobacco company , is based in @entity149 and sells @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and other cigarettes			1
@entity155 - based @entity17 , which ranks as the third biggest in the @entity120 , is behind the @entity142 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity17 and other brands			0
@entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
