the internet was abuzz last week when the cast of the all - female " ghostbusters " reboot was announced			1
the crop of funny ladies charged with eliminating the undead are some of the top female comedians working today			1
the chatter and support has a lot to do with the fans these women have garnered			0
it also comes from groups and individuals -- male and female -- who long to see more women headlining major @entity21 films			1
so , is " @entity23 " progress ? yes			1
is it a panacea ? no. let 's talk about why			0
putting women front and center in film is the exception , not the rule			0
using " ghostbusters " as an example of how far females have come is like celebrating @entity36 's best director @entity37 -- and forgetting that she 's the only woman ever to take home that honor			0
you can applaud @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 , too			0
but , they 're following the legions of guys who have protected and ruled the planet , palaces and corporate empires near and far			0
it 's fair and important to celebrate these high - profile moments of progress			1
doing so , however , may dismiss the lack of diversity that persists onscreen and behind the camera in @entity21 movies			1
our annual statistics on women 's participation in the year 's 100 top - grossing films reveal stagnation			1
in 2013 , only 29 % of 4,506 speaking characters evaluated were female			1
in another study , we examined popular films from 1990 to 1995			0
the percentage was 29 %			0
for those of you who think the past was better , other research shows that women clocked in at 25 % of characters in a sample of movies from the late 1940s			0
interestingly , only 28 % of movies in 2013 depicted a female lead or co-lead			2
behind the camera it 's even worse			2
women rarely get to direct large budget features on the scale of " @entity23 " or " @entity83			1
" across top - grossing films from 2002 to 2013 , only 4.2 % of all directors were female			1
in 2013 and 2014 , there were only two female directors each year			2
even more dismal figures concern black or @entity90 female directors			2
only three black women were directors across 700 popular movies between 2007 and 2014			0
what drives the lack of diversity in films ? our studies with industry leaders ( funded by the @entity100 on gender in @entity102 and @entity103 / @entity99 ) reveal that both in front of and behind the camera , perceptions about market forces and money are to blame for the lack of females			1
male leads , stories and properties are seen as more profitable , while female stories and casts are seen as a risk			1
for female directors , the financing structure , subject matter , and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress			2
much like pesky poltergeists , these myths about profitability will have to be busted before change can occur			0
to do so , solutions need to be implemented that overcome implicit biases and circumvent stereotyping			0
leveling the playing field when it comes to hiring is one step toward creating a more balanced behind - the - scenes environment			2
we have previously advocated for a modified version of the @entity140 's @entity139 : a league - wide commitment to interviewing diverse candidates for coaching positions			2
@entity146 to @entity21 , the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors			1
another solution we 're implementing at @entity151 is to look holistically at the entertainment industry from decision - making to the content we view			2
the @entity155 will " grade " companies based on the diversity within their ranks and the media they create			0
media conglomerates can be held accountable for their decisions across film , television and digital productions			0
while not every story should or can be female - dominated or focus on underrepresented racial and / or ethnic groups , examining a slate of content will reveal where and when stories about diverse groups and individuals are valued and told			1
right now , lifting the veil on diversity in @entity21 reveals white men standing behind the curtain			1
in this environment , casting four women to take care of a metropolitan ghost problem does feel rather extraordinary			0
sealing up cracks in the development , casting and hiring pipeline for women and underrepresented groups , however , should result in an onscreen reality that is more representative of the world we live in			0
then , the only unreal thing about " @entity23 " will be the ghouls and goblins , not the women busting them .			1

a " @entity23 " reboot has been announced with all - female leads
but lack of diversity persists on screen and behind camera in @entity21 , *authors* say
