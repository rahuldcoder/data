yes , the cast for the upcoming " @entity5 " is huge and packed with big - name stars , including franchise veterans @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity11			0
but in the new teaser for " @entity4 , " which nearly broke the internet when it was released friday , it 's @entity3 who 's featured			1
in the first 25 seconds , a chilling voice announces that " there 's been awakening			2
" and then , in a great bit of editing , we see @entity3 pop up on screen , startled , sweaty and in a @entity23 suit			1
what does that mean ? only time and / or director @entity26 will tell			0

you know him best from " @entity54			2
" for those who 've seen 2011 's sleeper hit " @entity54 , " @entity3 is a huge selling point for " @entity4			1
" the premise for " attack " is kind of crazytown , as it follows a group of streetwise kids who battle aliens that descend upon @entity38			0
but @entity3 completely owns the role of @entity65 in the film , turning " attack " into a must - see			2
even more impressive , " attack " was @entity3 's first feature film role			1
as @entity71 has explained , if " it 's a lightsaber - swinging @entity72 we want , then @entity3 is simply the man for the job			1
