@entity3 's $ 200 million superhero sequel earned $ 175.3 million in its first three days in @entity4 from 4,253 theaters â € ” the second best opening weekend of all time behind " @entity6 ' " $ 207.4 million bow on this weekend a year ago			1
the film managed a robust $ 41,218 per theater average and got a big boost from @entity12 screens , which accounted for $ 16.5 million of its opening weekend gross			1
about 45 percent of tickets sold were in the 3 - d format			0
like " @entity6 , " " @entity17 " played to a broad spectrum of demographics with a tilt toward older men			1

@entity3 also reports that couples made up 52 percent of viewers , while families accounted for 27 percent , and teens 21 percent			0
movie trailers : survey finds many turned off by seeing best scenes in promos " @entity17 " opened higher than both " @entity1 " ( $ 98.6 million ) and " @entity32 " ( $ 128.1 million ) , which is n't all that surprising given that it 's arriving after " @entity6 , " which earned $ 623.4 million domestically and became the biggest hit of 2012			1
it 's difficult to imagine that " @entity17 " could have garnered such impressive numbers without the boon of " @entity6 " â € ” especially because " @entity32 " was tepidly received by most viewers and ultimately finished with less than " @entity1 " ( $ 312.4 million vs. $ 318.4 million )			1
it 's to @entity42 's credit that they were able to augment interest in the " @entity1 " franchise with " @entity6			2

" still , " @entity17 " already seems like the probable winner of the summer box office crown			1
globally , " @entity1 3 's " total stands at an estimated $ 680.1 million after 12 days of release			2
in @entity85 , the film 's number one international market , it 's earned a stunning $ 63.5 million after just five days			2
" @entity1 3 's " $ 504.8 million international haul already trumps " @entity32 's " $ 311.5 million international total , and the three - quel appears to be headed for an overseas gross in line with " @entity6 ' " $ 888.4 million total			1
( " @entity6 " ultimately earned $ 1.5 billion globally			1
) basically , " @entity17 " is a lock for a finish above $ 1 billion worldwide , and right now , a tremendous $ 1.2 billion total seems likely			0
for star @entity95 , who portrays wise - cracking billionaire @entity1 , " @entity17 " marks the latest incredible success in his @entity98 comeback			0
a little more than a decade ago , the actor 's career appeared dead in the water due to substance abuse arrests and rehab stints , but he 's made a turnaround that so few troubled stars ever do			0

while that 's not a great result , the @entity123 - directed action flick cost just $ 26 million			0
in third place is @entity127 ' only hit this year , the baseball drama " 42 , " which brought in another $ 6.2 million for a $ 78.2 million total			1
the $ 40 million film may finish with about $ 90 million domestically			0
fourth place belonged to @entity134 's @entity133 vehicle " @entity132 , " which fell by a distressing 67 percent to $ 5.8 million in its third weekend for a $ 76 million total			1
the film has proven exceedingly front - loaded both in the @entity137 , where it opened with $ 37.1 million just two weeks ago , and overseas			0
@entity139 , " @entity132 " has earned $ 222 million , which likely is not enough to offset the substantial costs of production ( " @entity132 " had a $ 120 million budget ) , distribution , and marketing			1
