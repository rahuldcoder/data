the scrapbook is filled with photographs and tributes : they show @entity5 ' son @entity4 growing from a teenager into a young man			2
offering brief glimpses of past holidays and family moments , clues to his passions and personality , the book is one of @entity18 ' few souvenirs of her son 's short life			0
@entity4 , from @entity21 , converted to @entity22 four years ago , gradually becoming more and more devout			0
bons , who is a former @entity25 soldier , says @entity4 had never spoken to her about wanting to join a religious war , but last year the 30 - year - old announced he and his half - brother were going on vacation together			1
three weeks later he called to say they were in @entity31 -- two of the more than 900 @entity25 citizens the government believes are involved in the jihad there and in @entity37			1
within days , his half - brother was killed , and shortly afterward he spoke to his mother for the last time , telling her she would be notified if anything happened to him			1
in late december , @entity40 received a text message explaining that @entity4 has been killed in " an explosives operation " -- that 's all she knows			1
" the body ? there is no body ... i do n't have a body , " she says			0
" if he was killed in a truck filled with explosives , the body ... boom ! " because no body has been recovered , there is also no death certificate , meaning that -- officially at least , in @entity25 -- @entity4 is still alive			1
for his mother , he always will be			2
in her grief , she has written a poem -- added to the treasured scrapbook -- telling her son : " you will exist in my heart eternally			0
" unlike @entity5 , one anonymous @entity25 bus driver knows his daughter is still alive in @entity31 -- but he is desperately worried that may not be the case for much longer			1
the man -- who asked not to be identified out of concern for his daughter 's safety -- says the 23 - year - old converted to @entity22 and married a @entity74 man before moving to @entity31 with the couple 's two children			1
the couple said they were going there to do humanitarian work ; they are now believed to be in @entity82 , and safe -- for the moment at least -- but the city , an @entity86 stronghold , is a target of coalition forces			0
and both father and daughter fear she could be arrested if she comes back to @entity25			1
he has a warning for other parents : " pay attention ... it could happen to you before you even know it			0
" @entity96 , author of " the @entity97 , " believes there are many reasons why so many @entity25 @entity100 are becoming radicalized and heading to @entity37 and @entity31 to join militant groups			1
" religious frustrations , material frustrations , perhaps a feeling that it would be a sin to stay back in @entity25 , a desire to experience this historic moment and die fighting the coalition , " he explains			1
concerned at the growing threat of radicalization , @entity25 authorities have introduced new regulations in an effort to stem the tide of citizens traveling to the @entity115 to join the fight			1
" we had to change our rules in different ways , " foreign minister @entity117 explained to @entity119 's @entity118 recently			0
" first we decided that the government , the administration , would be able to suspend not only passports but also @entity126 for people whose intention is to go to @entity31			2
" the second step is to encourage families concerned at the path their children appear to be taking to contact the authorities and report their fears			0
" because we have many cases where families do not agree with the youngster and at the moment they are aware that the young people want to leave and therefore they have to get in touch with us in order to have a reaction , " he said			2
" we have to be very , very strict and to explain to these young people , especially the young girls -- 13 , 14 years old -- that if they are going there , some of them think that it will be a new life , [ but ] in fact they are prostitutes , they are sexual slaves			0
" the young people are utilized and many of them are killed			2
" @entity150 has spent the past nine months trying to bring his teenage sister safely home from @entity31 before it is too late			2
@entity154 , 16 , was recruited and given a plane ticket to join the fight in @entity31 , according to @entity25 intelligence			1
@entity150 is convinced she is being held against her will , and took the risky step of trying to find her and get her back -- he was even taken captive at one point			0
but when he finally tracked her down , he could n't convince her to leave			0
" i told her to come back with me but she cried and beat her head against the wall and she said i ca n't i ca n't			0
" later he was told the leader of the group wanted to marry her			0
since @entity154 is a minor , @entity150 's lawyer hopes that if she does make it back he can persuade @entity25 officials to treat her as a victim not a combatant			2
like @entity150 and @entity40 , the relatives of many of those caught up in the jihadists ' web say they feel powerless to protect their children and siblings			0
@entity40 has set up an organization aimed at publicizing what has happened to some of those who have made the trip to @entity37 and @entity31			1
she hopes that by spreading the news through schools and social media , she can convince others of the dangers posed by @entity191 extremists -- though for her son , it is too late			1
