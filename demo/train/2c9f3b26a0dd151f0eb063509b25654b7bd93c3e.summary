she 's a giant , and ancient , jigsaw puzzle : 300 bones , 19 bony plates and four vicious - looking spikes			1
the world 's most complete stegosaurus skeleton -- nicknamed @entity7 -- has gone on display at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
at 5.6m long and 2.9m tall , the @entity11 is roughly the size of a 4x4 vehicle -- though it predated such motors by 150 million years			1
paleontologists at the museum have spent 12 months studying the skeleton , measuring , photographing and scanning it , as well as practicing putting it together			2
now , a year after she arrived in @entity10 from the @entity21 , @entity7 -- named after the daughter of a wealthy financier whose donation allowed the museum to acquire her -- is finally ready to make her public debut			1
the museum 's lead dinosaur researcher , professor @entity27 , said the stegosaurus was incredibly rare			1
" finding one as complete as this , where only the left arm and base of the tail are missing , is exceptional , " he said in a statement			0
" it 's the only stegosaurus in the world that 's anywhere near this complete			2
so it 's an amazing find			0
" as well as drawing visitors in to the museum , @entity27 said the specimen offered many interesting opportunities for research			0
" because the new skeleton is almost complete , and three - dimensional , we can do a lot of things that have not been possible until now , such as looking at how the leg muscles work or how the skull functions during biting			2
" thanks to this fossil , we can begin to uncover the secrets behind the evolution and behavior of this iconic but poorly understood dinosaur species			0
" key to its importance is the fact that the fossil 's skull bones are not fused together , allowing paleontologists the chance to experiment : " it 's almost like playing with a @entity67 set , " @entity27 said			2
while they do n't actually know whether it was male or female ( despite the name ) , they can tell the dinosaur was relatively young when it died -- adult stegosaurus are known to have measured up to 9m in length			0
and although its spine plates and spiked tail mean it looks a little threatening , back when it was alive the stegosaurus would have been a vegetarian and a solitary creature			0
the first stegosaurus was discovered in @entity82 in 1877 by paleontologist @entity83			0
the @entity9 's specimen was found at @entity85 in @entity86 in 2003 -- it took 18 months of painstaking excavation work to free it from the ground it had lain in for so long .			1
