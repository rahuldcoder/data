@entity0 -- volunteers toiled for hours on friday cleaning mostly man - made debris from a @entity0 coastline , the scattered religious offerings from a growing @entity9 population in @entity10			1
the group has drawn concern among local conservationists after leaving offerings -- clothing , statues , plastic flowers and other items -- along the @entity19 near @entity20			1
" i was appalled to see the condition of the place , " said @entity0 @entity21 , a practicing @entity9			1
" it was really disgustingly filthy			0
" many defend the practice , considered a sacred @entity9 tradition			1
millions of worshippers leave offerings to the gods at @entity32 's @entity31 each year			2
" there are times when we feel that we need to come to the sea , to offer flowers and of course ... material things because we feel that flowers , they just go , " said @entity33 , a spokeswoman for the @entity35 temple , @entity36 , who helped organize friday 's clean - up			2
" we see @entity47 in the sea , " she said			0
what remains is a standoff between those who insist on practicing their beliefs unfettered and environmentalists who are trying to preserve the area for local marine life			0
affected by the buildup and inspired by a park ranger who helped remove debris with him several years earlier , @entity21 returned to his temple to encourage executives and its members to visit the park and see the destruction			2
" it is the sea			0
it is something that we as @entity9 worship , " he told them , " it is the medium that we use from this life to the after - life			1
" @entity21 warned that if the area was continually polluted , his people could be banned			0
@entity78 , a supervisory park ranger of the @entity19 who attended the clean - up , agrees the religious practices have put definite pressure on the bay			1
" it 's a rich biodiverse ecosystem but it 's definitively suffering some major environmental issues , " @entity78 said			2
these extra items left on the bay are one of its biggest threats for @entity20 , a national park that 's home to more than 325 species of birds , invertebrates and sea life , @entity78 said			1
" they release nutrients into the bay that do n't belong there , and it exacerbates the water pollution problem we have , " she said			1
volunteers picking under rocks and through grass friday filled garbage bags of bottles , coconut shells , figurines and yards of cloth , all of which the group says they will try to recycle			2
@entity33 said the fabric , pulled and sometimes ripped from beneath the shoreline , is just another part of the material possessions offered to the gods			0
" you see that the colors we 're picking up are very pretty colors , " she said " and we as @entity9 think that we should give @entity47 the best			1
" the material collected by @entity33 's organization is washed before being sent back to @entity32 as clothing			0
" so it was kind of a recycling process , " she said of their efforts			0
" it 's amazing , " @entity78 said of the group 's efforts			0
" this just shows such wonderful turnout from the local community			0
