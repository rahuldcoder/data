-- whenever i have to make a tough decision , i look up at the wall of my office , where i have hung the original immigration certificates and pictures of my grandparents			1
they fled @entity9 and immigrated to the @entity10 at the turn of the last century			1
though i lost them many years ago , they have always been my source of inspiration			0
i look into those eyes that saw poverty , persecution , anti-semitism and hatred , and along with fear , i see something else : hope			0
their eyes are wide open to the promise and opportunity of @entity10			1
after the 2012 elections , it seemed there was one issue that could unite @entity32 and @entity33 : reforming our nation 's broken immigration system so that more people like my grandparents could live the @entity38			1
fast - forward eight months			0
in the @entity42 , the hope for bipartisan cooperation is now reality			0
by a wide margin -- one that is unheard - of in today 's polarized @entity46 -- the @entity42 passed a comprehensive immigration bill that guarantees our nation 's borders are secure , protects @entity10 workers and offers undocumented immigrants an earned path to citizenship that is tough but fair			1
the nonpartisan @entity56 reports ( @entity57 ) that comprehensive immigration reform will strengthen our economy and reduce the deficit , so not only is reform the right thing to do , it 's also fiscally sound policy			1
the only obstacles to finally fixing our broken immigration system are speaker @entity65 and @entity66 republicans			2
if @entity66 @entity32 fail to act , voters who care about this issue -- especially our growing @entity70 population -- will know they ca n't count on @entity66			2
instead of moving forward in the weeks since the @entity42 bill passed , @entity66 @entity32 have allowed intolerant voices to remain the face of their party on immigration			2
people like rep. @entity77 , who has compared immigrants to dogs and @entity81 - eligible children to drug runners , do n't deserve a place on the @entity84 that will decide the future of immigration reform			1
if @entity66 @entity66 are serious about having a constructive debate , they will remove @entity77 from his position of authority			2
while it is true that @entity65 's @entity66 has given us little reason to be optimistic and @entity77 's rhetoric is contrary to the principles that make this country great , i still have hope for the future of immigration reform			1
there are several @entity66 whose constituents will demand progress on immigration , and @entity66 @entity33 want to work with them on finally achieve lasting reform			2
we can do this , but only if we do it together			0
we all came to @entity106 knowing we would face hard choices			0
for @entity65 , that hard choice means abandoning the foolish @entity109 , which requires that " the majority of the majority " party support legislation before it can be brought to a vote in the whole @entity66 , an artificial barrier to bipartisan cooperation			1
in effect , the rule keeps the speaker in power while preventing @entity32 and @entity33 from coming together			2
and most troubling , it thwarts the will of the people , a consequence that is fundamentally at odds with who we are as @entity10			1
i do n't think that when my grandparents took those pictures , they ever imagined they would be hanging in the @entity132			0
but i know that if they believed that it was possible anywhere , it was only possible here -- because they had a voice in their government			0
there are 434 members of the @entity66 who could probably tell a similarly inspiring story about their families ' immigration journeys			0
for the good of the country , i hope @entity65 draws strength from all of these stories to do what is right for this nation of immigrants			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			0

@entity156 says his grandparents fled persecution in @entity9 to seek promise of @entity10
he says *post-election* hopes that the parties could unite over immigration reform have *dimmed*
he says rep. @entity77 has *insulted* @entity167 ; @entity65 - led @entity32 using *procedural* *tactics* to deny vote
@entity171 : @entity65 's use of @entity109 is barrier to bipartisanship , thwarts will of the people
