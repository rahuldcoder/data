-- @entity2 's right place is at the vanguard of the quest for freedom and equality			1
the country was founded on that principle , as a nation whose very identity is built on equal rights and true freedom for its citizens			1
wednesday 's twin decisions by the @entity17 in favor of gay equality allowed the country to move closer to its founding ideals			1
that is not just good news for gay @entity24 , for their families and for the @entity24			1
it is excellent news for the cause of freedom and equality around the globe , and not just for gay people			1
what happens in the @entity24 matters			1
that 's why when the high court ruled that the federal law perversely named the " @entity40 " or @entity40 is unconstitutional and allowed the anti-gay marriage proposition 8 in @entity42 to be struck down , the news rippled to all corners of the world			1
you can be sure the news brought smiles to faces in the @entity49 , in @entity50 and elsewhere			0
the @entity24 is hardly the first country to have laws and court rulings in favor of equality for gays			1
in fact , @entity2 has fallen far behind in what is now a worldwide movement -- and there is a very long way to go before gays in @entity2 can claim they are treated equally , if only by the law			1
the @entity64 was the first country to fully legalize gay marriage			2
it did it without much fanfare in 2000			0
since then , more than a dozen countries have followed suit			2
gay couples have marriage equality in all corners of the world , not just in liberal @entity76 nations such as @entity77 and @entity78 , but also in @entity2 -- in @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 -- and as far away as @entity50 and @entity82			1
most of the world , however , is not as open to equality			2
@entity86 as recently as last year , @entity85 executed young men by public hanging			0
it is one of several countries where homosexuality is punishable by death			1
in many other places , the punishment is prison			0
in many more , there are intense legal and social restrictions			0
in @entity103 , the names and addresses of gay activists have been published in the local media , triggering violent attacks , and a pending law would impose life imprisonment for gays and up to three years for anyone who knows and fails to report homosexuals			2
@entity24 evangelists have promoted the crackdown			1
in @entity114 , just this month the @entity114 parliament passed a @entity115 banning " propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations			0
" gay rights demonstrators have been brutally beaten in what has almost become a ritual in @entity114 and elsewhere			1
despite intense and often well - founded criticism of the @entity24 and complaints that its rhetoric does n't match its behavior , @entity2 wields enormous social , cultural and political sway around the planet			1
the court ruling on same sex marriage will be read carefully by some jurists in some countries			2
its words may find their way to other rulings			2
Â other people will read just a few key words			0
the @entity40 decision by justice @entity139 centered on one of the most fundamental concepts of democracy : the notion of equal protection			0
the ruling articulates an idea that will resonate in the many nations struggling with internal divisions and just learning the meaning of democracy and freedom			2
a government can not simply deny equality ; it can not treat one group of people differently without a legitimate purpose			0
most people will only see a headline			0
they will see pictures of celebrations in the @entity24			2
they will hear that in the @entity24 gay couples can now marry			1
that is not quite correct			0
in most @entity24 states same - sex couples can not marry , although some experts believe the language of the @entity139 decision provides the arguments that will soon make that possible			2
@entity139 , the court , the activists and lawyers who brought these decisions may not have thought much about the rest of the world when working on this case			0
but the whole world was indeed watching			0
the whole world started watching a long time ago			0
more than 300 years ago , @entity180 appealed to an international audience when he wrote the @entity182			0
in the very first paragraph he said " respect to the opinions of mankind " was the reason why @entity24 had to spell out their decision to break free from the @entity186			2
" we hold these truths to be self - evident , " he explained " that all men are created equal			0
" and he added that government is created for the purpose of securing unalienable rights , including " @entity196			0
" that is the essence of @entity2 , and it is the reason why the country has exerted such a powerful appeal to those seeking freedom over the centuries			1
the @entity24 has very plainly strayed on many occasions from that path it so highly charted for itself			1
but the country has also shown a remarkable ability to correct course because its people have never become so jaded as to forget those founding ideals			0
one reason @entity2 has succeeded for centuries in staying at the forefront of history is that history , as @entity216 said , is the unfolding of an awareness of freedom			1
a country that stands on the side of freedom and equality is inevitably a country on the right side of history			0
with the two @entity17 rulings , the @entity24 edges closer to the vanguard			1
that 's good for @entity2 , and it 's a very good thing for the world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			0

@entity234 : @entity17 rulings on gay rights resonate around the world
she says they help restore @entity2 's role at the vanguard of *personal* freedom
@entity245 : many countries still *harshly* publish homosexuality
she says @entity24 has strayed from its role at times but it 's appropriate to return to it
