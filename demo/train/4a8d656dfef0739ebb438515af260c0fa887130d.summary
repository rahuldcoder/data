-- now that @entity2 has all but wrapped up the @entity4 nomination for president , the discussion has veered toward potential running mates			1
who embodies the conservative credentials @entity2 is seen as lacking ? who can deliver a battleground state that will put @entity2 over the top ? who can generate the enthusiasm that will bring not only @entity4 , but also independents , to the polls on @entity16 ? presidential candidates -- democrats and @entity4 alike -- have always considered factors like these			1
what is notable about this year 's early speculation , however , is the manner in which women have been incorporated into the conversation			1
we seem to have reached the point at which a woman is always included in a " veepstakes " list			1
the @entity30 named nine men and gov. @entity32 of @entity33 as its top 10 picks			0
the @entity35 included gov. @entity36 of @entity37 as one of its top seven names			2
and @entity40 offered nine men and two women as plausible running mates			2
a few days ago , on @entity45 , @entity44 laid out several categories of contenders			1
his " top tier " included sens. @entity48 of @entity49 and @entity50 of @entity51 , along with former @entity49 gov. @entity52			0
among the " second tier " possibilities were @entity57 gov. @entity56 , rep. @entity58 of @entity59 , and @entity61 gov. @entity60			0
and then there were " the women			0
" in a category all to themselves , @entity44 placed sen. @entity66 of @entity67 , as well as three governors : @entity36 , @entity32 and @entity69 of @entity70			2
politics : @entity48 backs @entity52 for vp anyone can debate the pros and cons that each of these candidates would bring to the @entity4 ticket			1
what is not up for debate , however , is that @entity44 , and undoubtedly many others , consider certain potential candidates as women first and political professionals second			1
before her election as governor in 2010 , @entity69 served two terms in the @entity88 and 12 years as lieutenant governor			0
her executive experience , therefore , is not very different from that of @entity60			0
before winning a gubernatorial election two years ago , @entity32 served as district attorney ( a position to which she was first elected in 1996 )			0
her political pedigree is similar to @entity97 ; he served as a federal prosecutor for six years before his election as governor in 2010			0
@entity66 was @entity67 's attorney general when she was elected to the @entity102 last cycle			0
@entity48 , who joined @entity66 as a member of the freshman class , had never before held statewide office , although he had served in the @entity49 legislature for 10 years			0
we do not mean to diminish the credentials of any of these men			0
in fact , that 's our point			0
all of these names are credible and viable vice-presidential candidates			0
@entity44 does n't say whether the women he lists are " top tier , " " second tier " or even " wild cards " ( another of his categories )			1
they 're just " women			0
" consumers of political news are denied a real analysis of these women 's place in the informal pecking order			2
of course , @entity44 is not the first to evaluate politicians as women first and politicians second			1
as scholars of gender politics , we are long familiar with the tendency among the media and those who practice politics to refer to a " woman governor " or " women candidates			1
" we hear talk about the gender gap and the @entity4 's " woman problem " as if women are one large , undifferentiated group best identified by their sex			1
and we routinely see pundits , pollsters , and politicians refer to women running for office as " outsiders " ( even when they 're insiders ) or " out - of - the - box choices " ( even when they 're quite conventional )			2
this is , of course , because women are still woefully underrepresented at every level of @entity157 government			1
as long as women remain an anomaly in politics , their sex will continue to cause them to stand out			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 and @entity164 .			1

@entity164 , @entity163 : @entity2 likely @entity4 pick ; focus now on finding vp
they say nowadays women usually at least included in list of potential vp candidates
they say @entity45 's @entity44 made lists of potential candidates ; gave women a separate list
*writers* : women still woefully underrepresented in electoral politics ; viewed as outsiders
