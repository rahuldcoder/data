@entity0 and @entity2 , together for more than 30 years , made history thursday by participating in @entity5 ' first same - sex marriage , despite a statewide ban			1
hours later , however , the @entity7 blocked other gay couples from obtaining marriage licenses after a legal challenge by @entity5 attorney general @entity11			1
the state high court did not explicitly say it invalidated the marriage of the two women in @entity16 , but @entity11 said in a statement that the court voided the marriage license			1
" the same - sex marriage license ... is void , just as any license issued in violation of state law would be , " the attorney general said			1
@entity24 , a professor at the @entity25 in @entity26 , said via email that the @entity7 stay did not mention the marriage license			1
" he is asserting something that the order does not say on its face , " @entity24 said of @entity11			0
" he may be correct , but you sure can not tell what he says from the order 's wording			0
" a county clerk in @entity16 issued the state 's first marriage license to the same - sex couple , acting on the order of a @entity44 judge who said health issues prevented the couple from waiting for further court decisions			1
@entity44 clerk @entity49 's office said she issued @entity0 and @entity51 a marriage license at the order of district judge @entity53			1
@entity0 said she had emergency surgery after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in may			0
@entity11 responded by asking the @entity7 to block any rulings that " seek to undermine the constitutionality of @entity5 ' marriage law			1
" " the @entity59 clearly defines marriage as between one man and one woman , as @entity5 voters approved by an overwhelming majority , " he said in a statement on wednesday			1
" the law of @entity5 has not changed , and will not change due to the whims of any individual judge or county clerk operating on their own capacity anywhere in @entity5			1
activist judges do n't change @entity5 law , and we will continue to aggressively defend the laws of our state and will ensure that any licenses issued contrary to law are invalid			1
" in a statement , gov. @entity79 said the " @entity59 defines marriage as consisting ' only of the union of one man and one woman ' and was approved by more than three - quarters of @entity5 voters			1
i am committed to ensuring that the @entity59 is upheld and that the rule of law is maintained in the @entity5			2
" thursday 's order applied only to that one couple , and " any additional licenses issued to same - sex couples also must be court ordered , " @entity49 's office said in a statement			1
" we 're here today -- two moms , two daughters -- but we 're not different than the thousands and thousands of same sex couples who were recognized in the last census , " @entity51 said			2
" there are thousands of gay @entity100			0
everybody knows one or two or three			0
even if you do n't know , you do know them			2
they may not feel safe to be out but you know them			0
" at a news conference , @entity0 and @entity51 held hands with their daughters , @entity110 and @entity111			0
" is this really happening ? " @entity51 asked a couple of times			0
" it 's a very important day for our family , " she told reporters			0
" it 's a very important day for everyone who believes in justice and equality			0
" " this really is very very meaningful to our family to have the kind of ability to make personal decisions , health decisions and financial decisions as a family , " @entity0 said of the historic moment			2
but @entity0 said the moment was bittersweet			0
" there are many other @entity100 , thousands of @entity100 who would like to be able to have their loving committed relationship recognized , " she said			0
@entity24 said the @entity7 stay essentially means the issuance of other marriage licenses to gay couples is unlikely			0
and the county court judge 's ruling does not portend the end of the @entity5 ban			1
" i think that the state court judge seems to be treating this case as a special one ( because ) of the health issues involved , so this appears to be a special exception , " he said			1
" but ( it 's ) unclear why the ( attorney general ) is so vigorously contesting what seems to be a narrow ruling , which may only apply to the couple before the court			2
" @entity5 ' ban on same - sex marriage was struck down by a federal judge in january 2014 , though that judge allowed it to remain in effect pending appeals			1
" we did n't want to wait for the @entity7 to make a decision -- which in june they probably will allow @entity100 to marry , " @entity51 said			2
" we have reasons to need to move a little bit faster			0
it seems that the judge understood that			0
" @entity51 , an attorney , said she was n't too concerned about the state attorney general 's efforts			2
" if they want to come in and try to undo this they will , " she told reporters			0
" we have a valid marriage license and i do n't think they can			1
" @entity49 's statement said her office was ordered to immediately " cease and desist relying on the unconstitutional @entity5 prohibitions against same - sex marriage as a basis for not issuing a marriage license			1
" in the case of @entity0 and @entity51 , the statement cited " severe and immediate health concerns			0
" " we are all waiting for a final decision on marriage equality , " @entity49 said in the statement			0
" however , this couple may not get the chance to hear the outcome of this issue because ( of ) one person 's health			2
... it is important to note that this order applies only to the medically fragile couple who brought the court action			2
any additional licenses issued to same - sex couples also must be court ordered			1
" @entity11 said his office filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the @entity44 clerk from issuing any other same - sex marriage licenses			1
@entity51 told reporters , " we 're just very grateful that we 've had this opportunity to crack the door open in @entity5			2
we hope it will swing wide for everyone very soon			0
" @entity1 's @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
