-- we still ca n't watch baseball without a bunch of big dopes getting in our way			0
there we were that monday , a day when yet another of the game 's great players ( @entity10 ) got expelled for doing something bad , right in the middle of a very entertaining season , witnessing good things galore			1
a beautiful , king - of - the - hill , top - of - the - heap @entity18 moment for retiring pitcher @entity20 at the @entity21			1
a breakout , star - is - born summer for a @entity25 boy named @entity26 who is belting home runs at a remarkable clip			1
a revival of the @entity30 following the arrival of @entity32 , a young @entity33 kid with incredible charisma			1
oh , and let 's not forget the low - budget , low - expectation @entity37 looking like bling - ring contenders for a change			2
and the large - budget , lousy - last - year @entity41 looking a whole better than a lot of experts expected them to look			2
and a lot of other fun in the sun. only to get rained on again			0
@entity48 stepped up that day to suspend a big , big name of the game , @entity10 of the @entity51 , his league 's @entity52 of 2011 , for the remainder of 2013			1
@entity10 suspended in a vaguely worded statement , the 29 - year - old @entity10 alluded to having " made some mistakes " as he accepted a ban from the field for the rest of this season			1
@entity10 had dodged this bullet once before , having failed a 2011 drug test only to successfully appeal it			1
now he conceded , saying , " i am not perfect			0
it is not a perfect game , baseball , but it sure can be a thing of beauty when it is played the right way			2
to our continuing disillusionment , we keep adding names to a @entity72 - like scroll of players who go at it the wrong way ( or sure do seem to )			0
some of us simply roll our eyes , the way we do when politicians get caught doing something unattractive , take themselves out of the game for a while , then magically reappear to run again on the i am not perfect ticket and seek your vote			2
you can expect @entity10 to be back , much the same way			1
a fan or two will boo in 2014 when his name is announced at a game , but if he hits the ball over the wall , a thousand or two others will stand and give him a hand as he rounds the bases , saying " nice job , @entity97 , " thrilled to have him back			2
@entity98 itself wo n't mind this latest suspension as much as it would if its team were not currently in last place			2
trust me , if the @entity51 were neck - and - neck right now with the @entity104 and the @entity37 in their division 's race for first place , beers would be cried into from @entity108 to @entity109 to @entity110			2
this guy is a huge deal there			0
" @entity10 " jerseys are n't often seen on @entity115 or in the @entity116 or deep in the heart of @entity118 , but in @entity119 , he seemed to be the @entity120 of his generation , a rising star in his 20s who could well be a legend by his 40s			1
in six seasons , @entity10 has been voted @entity125 in one , then an all - star in the next five			1
he already has 211 home runs			0
@entity128 , who spent his entire 20 - year career in @entity98 before being elected to baseball 's @entity130 , hit a total of 251 homers in that span			1
that 'll give you a small idea of how big @entity10 could be			1
he is paid a king 's ransom , if @entity139 's and @entity141 's new baby in @entity142 wo n't mind us saying			2
@entity10 has a nine - figure contract in @entity98 that runs through the year 2020			1
he is expected back at @entity145 , same time next year , tail between legs but bat in hand			0
@entity150 drops @entity10 after drug suspension i doubt if many elsewhere would recognize @entity10 today if he came walking down the street toward you			1
he probably would n't be mobbed by paparazzi in , say , @entity18 , a city with a history of big baseball stars			0
or mobbed by autograph hounds in downtown @entity160 , which is just 90 miles from @entity98 , which is where @entity10 absolutely is a big baseball star			1
he would n't have many smartphone cameras aimed his way while having dinner in @entity165 , which is in the general vicinity of @entity10 's hometown			1
he is no @entity168 , a famous face coast - to - coast			0
nor is he @entity171 , but they definitely do have something in common			0
@entity171 's name has been linked to @entity175 , a so - called " anti-aging " clinic in @entity176 that is being investigated over the possibility of making performance - enhancing drugs available to a number of athletes			1
@entity10 's name also surfaced in that investigation			1
some believe his suspension monday will be just the first of several more to follow in the days ahead			0
again and again , the game of baseball has taken measures and given assurance that steroid use or substance abuse in any form will not be tolerated			0
we tend to nod and believe none of today 's players would be foolish enough to take such a risk , but the fools could very well be us			0
@entity0 explains : performance enhancing drugs it was only a year ago that the @entity21 was won by the @entity202 -- and , as a reward , home - field advantage for the @entity205 -- with no small thanks due to @entity207 , a player from the @entity208 who was voted the midsummer game 's mvp			1
but shortly thereafter , @entity207 was suspended for a positive drug test and did not return to the @entity208 , who happily enjoyed their home - field edge in the @entity205 anyway			0
thank goodness this year 's @entity21 hero was the @entity217 ' heroic figure @entity20 , a man whose career has been pure to the point of immaculate in its lack of controversy or reputation stain			1
i am certain that @entity20 must have been guilty of doing something wrong during his career -- a parking ticket , perhaps , or leaving a sock in his locker -- but he remains among the hundreds of major leaguers who give us hope that baseball is a game more clean than dirty			1
@entity10 pulled the old @entity234 routine , casting aspersions on the work of those who did the testing and investigating , making it sound like somebody was out to get him			2
a lot of people bought it			0
he was going to be the one who really did get unfairly tagged as a doper ( and a dope )			0
and then rainy days and mondays come around , and there was @entity10 's permanent stain for all to see			1
it gets tiresome , does n't it ? hearing about this stuff ? reading about it ? ( writing about it sure as hell does			0
) would n't it be sweet if we could just get through an entire season talking about nothing else except whether the @entity260 boy would wallop 75 home runs , or if the @entity37 would finally get to hold a @entity205 in their beautiful ballpark , or if @entity234 's fans would introduce a " @entity266 " section in the outfield seats as prominently as the " @entity268 " sign ? oh , and do n't the @entity269 look good , too ? and , hey , the @entity270 are really on a roll			2
and that 's a nice trade the @entity273 just made			0
and , whoa , that @entity275 kid sure does throw hard			0
and maybe the @entity276 's really are in it to win it			0
and the town might be bankrupt but @entity280 's team is loaded , man			0
and plenty of good seats in @entity284 still available			0
we 're trying to watch a game here			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity290 .			2
