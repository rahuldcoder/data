-- as prodigal golfer @entity4 resumes the world 's no. 1 ranking , his chief sponsor , @entity3 , unveiled a slogan tuesday that provokes robust debate on what is redemption and has @entity4 attained it			1
" winning takes care of everything " is what @entity3 declared on its social media outlets after @entity4 completed his long climb back to the top ranking , more than three years after his extramarital affairs ruined his marriage and embarrassed him			1
woods and ex-wife , @entity22 , have two children			0
many fans and consumers are now raging against the new campaign by @entity3 , which stood by @entity4 in his fall from grace as most other sponsors dumped him			1
" will not buy anything @entity3 again , " wrote @entity30 of @entity31 on @entity3 's facebook page			1
" this ad makes me sick ! " wrote @entity34 , a high school teacher who said she will use the ad for a classroom discussion			2
" shame on you ! " others , however , endorsed the slogan			2
" love your @entity3 , " wrote @entity42			1
" keep up the good work			0
" opinion : for @entity4 , winning does take care of everything the passionate opinions roil during a week when redemption is on the minds of @entity51 celebrating @entity52 and @entity53 preparing for @entity54			1
the controversy grows from whether winning indeed absolves transgressions -- and even prompts a return to grace			1
the narrative plays out in different ways for different public figures			0
" i think that winning , especially in @entity4 ' case , really does change things because it reminds people why they fell in love with him years ago			1
it was for his game and his ability to consistently make those tough shots over and over again			0
that 's why we 're in awe of @entity4 , " said ceo @entity72 of @entity73 , a strategic communications and crisis management firm in @entity76			1
" does it erase what he 's done ? no. but when is it enough ? " @entity82 said			2
" it 's easy to criticize from afar , but when you sit across from someone who 's experienced public humiliation and a fall from grace and , in @entity4 's case , a breakup of an entire family and a permanent change in the way people view him , that 's a pretty high price to pay			1
" the slogan refers to how @entity4 has motivated himself to become the top golfer again , @entity3 said			1
he last held that rank in october 2010			2
" @entity4 has always said he competes to win , " @entity3 said in a statement			1
" when asked about his goals such as getting back to number one , he has said consistently winning is the way to get there			2
the statement references that sentiment and is a salute to his athletic performance			0
" in professional sports , winning can indeed overshadow a lot of quandaries , said sports analyst @entity111 , a @entity0 contributor			2
for example , a winning coach wo n't be fired for players accused of sexual assault or facing too many duis , he said			2
" usually a coach is fired because they 're not winning , " @entity111 said			2
" so it may make me cringe as a parent , i ca n't help but think of the fact that winning does seem to solve a lot of problems , and if you 're losing , that 's when everything else is more highlighted			2
" analysts also cite how quarterback @entity128 , who served an 18 - month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty to dogfighting , is now playing for the @entity131			0
linebacker @entity132 faced murder accusations -- later dropped by prosecutors -- in the deaths of two men after the @entity137 in @entity138 ; this year , @entity132 and his teammates on the @entity140 won the @entity141			2
" a lot of people have short memories when the person who had these issues starts winning , " said @entity142 , president of @entity143 , a sports and entertainment marketing firm			0
" as you can see with @entity132 , it does n't take much to forgive and forget			0
@entity153 loves the story of a person falling down and getting back up and then maybe falling down and getting back up again			0
" ethics expert @entity156 pointed out that @entity3 contradicts itself because it stopped sponsoring cyclist @entity157 after he admitted to doping in winning seven @entity159 titles			1
" this is an amazing story in the worst sense , " said @entity156			0
" this is a company that dropped @entity157 after mounting evidence made it pretty clear @entity157 won by cheating			0
so @entity3 made it clear that winning does not take of everything			1
" photos : redemption through sports in fact , @entity82 ' firm is representing @entity172 , a cycling teammate of @entity157			0
@entity172 was among those who broke from @entity157 , who then threatened to sue him			0
@entity172 also wrote about his own use of performance enhancing drugs			0
@entity82 declined to comment on @entity157 and @entity172 , but she spoke generally about how she helps athletes overcome setbacks			0
" look , everybody makes mistakes and sometimes they just need help in putting it in context for people : here 's what led me to the decision			0
and then let people judge it , " she said			0
at issue for @entity4 is whether he , like so many other celebrities whose professional lives are damaged by the revelation of personal failures , has redeemed himself as merely a public figure -- or as a human being , too ? " certainly in his job , it 's a redemption story , " said @entity200 , a @entity201 business ethics professor who directs its @entity202			1
" whether it is for him as a human being and his character , i do n't know			0
someone else will be the judge of that , " he added			0
@entity200 cited how winning did n't take care of everything for basketball star @entity214 , who faced accusations of sexually assaulting a woman in @entity217 in 2003 and later settled a federal civil lawsuit for an unspecified amount of monetary damages			1
" you have an overly long list of people who are ' winning ' -- whether they are in sports or a box office draw or selling platinum albums , " @entity200 said			1
" the world tells them they 're wonderful and they 're no. 1 and their sense of probity and respect for others or your own self tends to evaporate			1
" that 's when a lot can go wrong , @entity200 said			0
" i applaud @entity3 for taking up his rebirth , " @entity200 said about @entity4			1
but , he continued , " the slogan sort of falls on its face , and @entity4 is exhibit a for the case because it did n't care of everything three years ago			1

" winning takes care of everything , " @entity3 says on its ad for @entity4
the slogan is unveiled as @entity251 is ranked no. 1 in the world , the first time since 2010
some are outraged by the slogan in @entity4 ' case but others laud it
has @entity262 been redeemed as solely a golfer -- or a human being , too ?
