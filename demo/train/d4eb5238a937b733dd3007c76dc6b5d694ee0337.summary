@entity0 -- what 's wrong with the " @entity3 " comprehensive immigration reform bill ? @entity5 has a lot of answers to that question , but he starts by pointing to a picture of a modest white house built in the early 1930s in @entity11 , @entity12			1
" i grew up in rural @entity12 , in a poor area of the state , " the three - term @entity13 noted during a recent interview in his @entity0 office			0
" we did n't have central heat , but we got by			0
and people ( still ) do			0
" but " we 've got a serious social and economic problem in @entity23 , " the conservative senator said			0
" we 've got high unemployment among lower skilled workers , and their wages are n't even keeping up with inflation			1
" adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the work force , @entity5 said			1
specifically , he argued that in granting work authorization for millions of undocumented men and women over the next decade and beyond , the bill will benefit corporate titans by flooding the labor market and holding down stagnant salaries in an already weak economy			1
in short , it will lead to disaster for those @entity23 now clinging to the bottom rung of the economic ladder			0
it 's a populist argument not often heard in the higher echelons of today 's @entity46			1
" my @entity13 colleagues seem to be oblivious to the free market , " @entity5 said			1
sessions recently sat down with @entity1 to discuss his role in leading the charge against the 844 - page overhaul of the country 's immigration laws			1
he is by far the @entity55 's toughest critic of the bill -- crafted by four @entity57 and four @entity13 colleagues -- as it winds its way through the @entity57 - controlled @entity55			1
he offered almost 50 amendments to the @entity61 and is trying to derail the bill at nearly every turn			2
his office sends out daily -- sometimes hourly -- alerts highlighting various perceived flaws in the measure			0
the proposal " does not hold up to scrutiny , " he insisted			0
" we 're going to tell the truth about the bill			1
we 're going to expose it			2
" sessions is not new to this debate			2
during president @entity77 's second term , he helped kill a proposed bipartisan immigration overhaul pushed by sens. @entity79 and @entity80			2
like president @entity81 now , @entity77 made immigration reform a second term priority			2
back then -- as now -- reform backers highlighted the glut of undocumented workers doing the toughest jobs on @entity23 's farms and elsewhere			2
sessions is still irritated by a statement @entity77 made in 2006 that reform is needed because " there are jobs that just simply are n't getting done because @entity23 wo n't do them			2
" " when president @entity77 said that there were certain jobs @entity23 wo n't do , i consider it to be one of the greatest errors in his entire presidency , " @entity5 said			1
" @entity23 are doing tough work every day			0
they ought to be respected for it			0
they should n't be looked down for it			0
and we need their salaries going up			0
" some immigration reform proponents insist there 's no way to truly lock the border down if there 's a strong enough economic incentive to come to @entity23			2
sessions , however , insists the border can be fully secured , and that it was headed in that direction before @entity81 took office in 2009			2
homeland security secretary @entity121 and @entity120 ( @entity120 ) director @entity119 have overseen an " evisceration of internal enforcement , " he said , flatly contradicting @entity125 claims			0
if changes made at the end of @entity77 's term " had been followed up on , we could have already had the border substantially secure			0
" " a nation that pretends to have a lawful system of immigration has to be willing to execute that , " @entity5 said , noting that bitter opposition of the @entity120 agents ' union to the " @entity3 " bill			1
it requires " a certain effort and consistency that 's been lacking			0
" among the many flaws in the " @entity3 " bill , according to @entity5 , is a diminution of accountability standards along the border			1
he rails at a decision made by the authors of the bipartisan legislation to ignore a 1996 requirement for the use of biometrics -- such as fingerprints -- for visa holders at all entry and exit points			0
democrats and others call the standard -- which was never enacted -- unrealistic and prohibitively expensive			0
sessions introduced an amendment withholding citizenship from any undocumented worker until its complete enactment , but the proposal was voted down by the @entity61 in a 12 - 6 vote			2
the panel 's 10 @entity57 were joined by @entity13 @entity166 of @entity167 and @entity168 of @entity169 , both members of the " @entity3			1
" @entity166 and @entity168 have been working with the panel 's @entity57 majority to prevent any major changes to the bill			2
" everybody needs to know it -- who 's calling the shots , " @entity5 said at one recent committee meeting			1
sessions also takes aim at language in the bill swapping the existing @entity185 system -- an internet - based program used to check the legal status of potential employees -- with a new one that relies more strongly on photographic matches through passport and driver 's license images , among other things			1
supporters insist the new version will be more effective , but @entity5 says it 's unproven and offers too much discretion to the @entity200			1
it " could be an improvement " but " it 's dangerous the way ( the provision ) is written , " the senator argued			0
" i 'm wondering why they want to go around and create a new one			0
" beyond disputes over specific provisions , @entity5 makes what he characterizes as a broader moral argument against the proposal			1
" i will not support citizenship for people who entered the country illegally , " @entity5 said			1
" there needs to be some difference between what we do for a person who enters the country legally and those who enter illegally			1
" and there 's no moral , no legal , no principled reason why this @entity23 government should reward people who broke the law and entered the country illegally with every benefit that you give to somebody who comes lawfully			1
" the bill as currently written " just further incentivizes amnesties in the future , " he argued , invoking one of the most bitterly contested terms of the debate			2
while the @entity13 may be divided over immigration reform , analysts are not surprised by @entity5 ' role as leader of the @entity55 opposition			1
" given the politics of @entity12 , it does n't surprise me at all , " said @entity244 , chairman of the @entity246 's political science department			0
" politics here dictates you oppose whatever the president supports			0
" @entity244 noted @entity12 's passage in 2011 of one of the strictest laws in the country designed to crack down on undocumented immigration			1
among other things , the law requires police who make lawful traffic stops or arrests to try to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally			1
the law retains broad support in @entity12 , @entity244 said , even crossing the state 's traditional racial divide			0
" there 's nothing for sessions to lose and maybe lots to gain " in opposing the " @entity3 " bill , @entity244 said			1
as for political considerations on @entity277 , @entity5 told @entity1 the " @entity3 " put its blueprint together using an " old fashioned , smoke - filled room strategy			1
" as a result , he says , the bill was written by big labor and business interests			2
" i 've been around here a long time , " he said			0
" i 've never seen a more calculated , cold - blooded p.r. campaign managed to advance a piece of legislation than this one			0
" " the political consultants and pollsters and people ( managing the bill ) ... anticipated everything that was going to occur , " he declared			2
" they planned on careful attacks to neutralize critics			0
" " but somebody needs to ask questions about this bill , " he quickly added			0
" they do n't get to write a bill in secret , and we all roll over and have it passed without examination			0
" and what about the argument that by opposing comprehensive immigration reform , republicans risk permanently alienating @entity23 's rapidly growing @entity308 population ? sessions returns to his economic theme			1
" i believe that , politically , at this point in time we should serve and listen to the concerns of the working @entity23 who are making $ 20,000 to $ 45,000 a year , " @entity5 said			1
" that includes @entity308 , african - americans , and @entity316 , " he noted			0
" one of the reasons their wages have n't gone up is because there 's too much labor			0
and so , if we end the illegality with a good , principled immigration bill , ( if ) we allow a generous but responsible flow of immigrants in the future , and if we improve the lives of working @entity23 , then that 's the way you win elections			1
