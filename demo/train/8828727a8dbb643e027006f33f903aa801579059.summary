suicide continues to plague the @entity2 military , with an estimated 18 war veterans in the @entity2 ending their lives each day			1
one of the last resorts for veterans struggling with the return to civilian life is a suicide - prevention hot line based in @entity10			1
the humble offices of the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity10 , are like any other office space : desks , computers , telephones			1
but as you walk past each cubicle , you begin to hear extraordinarily disturbing conversations			1
" i have a .45 pointed at my head , " one caller says			2
" can you put that knife away for a bit while we talk ? can you do that for me ? can you hold off just for a little bit ? " a hot line worker asks			2
" what sort of weapons do you have ? " another calmly responds			2
the men and women who answer the @entity12 phones are on the front lines of an all - out war on suicide			1
each speaks to the caller with a very clear purpose : keep the person on the phone long enough to get help			2
" the first thing i say to a caller when they do have the object that they plan on killing themselves with them on their person , whether it 's a loaded gun on their lap or the rope already strung , i always say to them , ' can you agree to not shoot yourself , take your pills , get up on the ladder while we 're on the phone ? ' " explained @entity43 , a crisis line responder			1
the responders are part investigator , part therapist and part best friend			2
" we never ever give up on a rescue			2
whenever a vet needs help , we will do whatever it takes to find him if he ca n't tell us where he is			2
whatever it takes to get them help , " said @entity71 , a health tech at the @entity12			1
in 2011 , the @entity75 recorded 246 cases of confirmed or potential suicides among active - duty and reserve soldiers , according to statistics released in november			1
that number appears to be below the 2010 level of 305 for the full 12 months but above the second - highest year : 2009 , which had 242 suicides			1
the @entity2 @entity84 have recorded 28 confirmed suicides and 163 attempted suicides this year through october			2
current numbers were not available for the @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
those three branches reported suicides among service members in 2010 to be 39 , 100 and 112 , respectively			2
the numbers illustrate a small segment of the continuing emotional and physical toll of 10 years of war in @entity97 and @entity98 and how it defies a host of efforts by the government to detect and solve the problem of suicide			2
the @entity106 launched the @entity12 in 2007 , and close to 20,000 veterans have been rescued , officials say			1
" we 've taken over half a million calls , and 30,000 chats have come into the system , " said @entity108 , the national director of the @entity12			1
in addition to calling the hot line at 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 , veterans who are thinking about taking their own lives can chat with a responder at www.veteranscrisisline.net			1
veterans can also reach out for help by sending a text to 838255			1
and it 's not just about the veterans			1
active - duty soldiers also call in			1
" we have had several thousand active - duty people who have called , but we suspect many more , because it 's anonymous			1
we think that there are many more active - duty people who call and use our services , " @entity108 said			1
families and friends can call in to the hot line as well			1
@entity108 says she encourages those who know a veteran who may be struggling with depression to reach out to the crisis line			0
she says some of the warning signs that someone is contemplating suicide include " talking about death more often , starting to give away their possessions , saying things ( like ' i ) probably wo n't be around by @entity144			0
i wo n't need to know that next year			0
' " " if you hear those and know that they 're depressed or trouble with work or families , certainly give us a call , " @entity108 said			1
while the responders handle the incoming calls to the hot line , health techs alert police departments and ambulances across the country to get help to veterans trying to take their own lives			1
during a recent visit to the @entity12 office , one veteran told responder @entity166 that he planned to kill himself with a large knife to end what he called pain issues			1
" when she talked to him further , he said that had taken all of his medication , " said @entity170 , a crisis line health tech. @entity166 spent 45 minutes on the phone with the caller , trying to figure out exactly where the man was and then getting help to his front door			0
at one point , the veteran was so confused that he did n't know his address , presumably because of all the pills he had taken			0
" where 's your wife now ? she 's at work ? can i send somebody to help you ? ok , i think that 's what i 'm going to do			0
i think you want help			0
you called the hot line			0
and that 's the best thing , " @entity166 told the veteran			0
when police arrived , there was problem			0
" i could hear the struggle , but i do n't think they knew i was there			0
they did say he 's safe , and the officers were safe , " @entity166 said			0
the responders are flying blind most of the time			0
they ultimately have no idea what is happening on the other end of the phone			0
a short time later , a @entity214 veteran called the hot line , saying he was ready to end his life			0
" so you said as soon as we get off the phone , you 're going to take some pills ? is that all you plan on doing ? " @entity222 asked			0
the veteran told @entity222 his wife died this year			0
" he had been married for 20 years			0
... he called simply to give me a message to give to his family about funeral arrangements and that he wanted to be buried with a photograph of her , " @entity222 said			0
she began to ask simple questions to deduce a location			0
in just a few minutes , she knew his race , his age , what he was wearing and that he was at a pay phone on the @entity240 dock			0
in less than 15 minutes , police arrived to help			0
at least one life was saved that night .			1

the @entity12 was launched in 2007
*dispatchers* have saved 20,000 lives , according to the director
veterans and their loved ones can call 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 or text 838255
