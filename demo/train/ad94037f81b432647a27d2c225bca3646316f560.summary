@entity1 , @entity0 -- hip hop is one @entity5 commodity that has made it past the trade embargo to @entity8			1
@entity8 rap duo " @entity10 " say hip hop allows them to embrace social issues			1
@entity8 has developed a homegrown rap movement , inspired by the sounds and fashions of @entity5 hip hop			1
but what makes @entity8 rappers different is that rather than celebrating bling , girls and guns , their lyrics address social issues in a country where free speech is tightly controlled			2
@entity8 rap began to surface in the 1990s , a grassroots affair , with songs recorded in rappers ' bedrooms and distributed on cassette tapes			2
the island 's fledgling hip hop scene was given a boost in 1999 , when it was endorsed by the government as " an authentic expression of @entity38			1
" in the following years the government set up the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) to promote the scene , as well as a record label , " @entity45 , " and a rap magazine called " @entity44			0
" government approval helped @entity8 hip hop emerge from the underground , but some see that endorsement as a gilded cage			1
formed in 1996 , rap duo " @entity10 " ( " @entity53 " ) have been part of the @entity56 scene since the beginning and work with the @entity40			2
but rapper @entity59 admits there are contradictions in being part of the system			0
" it does limit our creative freedom , " he told @entity2			0
" the @entity40 has an agenda that goes with the government 's agenda			0
it does n't limit me but it does force me to be creative in how i express my ideas			0
" along with fellow @entity8 rap duo " @entity72 " ( " the @entity73 " ) " @entity10 " work with @entity5 hip hop audio / visual label , @entity76			1
but " @entity72 " , who formed in 2003 , are part of a younger generation of @entity8 rappers			2
they do n't belong the @entity40 , and nor do they want to			0
they are defiantly underground and outspoken			0
" hip hop is an art form speaks the truth about how people are living , " says @entity82 , one half of @entity72			1
their track " @entity90 " is about a young boy growing up during @entity8 's " special period " , when the fall of the @entity94 brought hardship to the island			1
their forthright lyrics about life in @entity8 do n't make them any friends among @entity8 's authorities , and that limits their opportunities on the island			1
" our lyrics do n't always go with the standard @entity8 rhetoric and often that wo n't get airplay , " says @entity82			2
" i can be famous in other countries , but here they wo n't let me play a concert in a theater			0
" listen to @entity10 and @entity72 here » @entity10 's @entity114 has performed the @entity5 with fellow @entity8 " @entity115 " , a tour that included playing on the same bill as @entity5 rap stars @entity118 and @entity120			1
he says that where his generation of rappers was forced to limit the way it talked about the realities of daily life , the new generation is bolder with its lyrics			0
@entity130 , also known as @entity131 , the other member of " @entity72 , " says hip hop gives voice to the concerns of ordinary @entity8			1
" people tell me they need this music , not just because they can identify with what we are saying , but because they feel that maybe we can say things they might be afraid to say publicly , " he told @entity2			0
like most other @entity8 rap groups , " @entity72 " are n't yet in a position to make a living from their music			1
@entity131 has won @entity8 's @entity146 freestyle rapping championship three years in a row , but he still has a day job as a primary school teacher			1
a lack of funds and equipment means the island 's hip hop producers have to use a certain amount of ingenuity when it comes to recording their music			1
@entity10 's producer @entity161 explains that in the group 's early days , he would make tracks by looping the last few bars of songs on cassette tapes			2
these days , @entity161 produces songs on his pc , but the software is pirated from copies brought into the country and circulated on the streets			0
it simply is n't available in the stores			0
more about @entity8 's arts : @entity176 takes @entity2 on a tour of @entity56			2
» as the scene develops the groups are getting more ambitious			0
@entity10 are now incorporating live musicians into their sound , weaving in elements of traditional @entity8 music , and they are set to release their debut album " @entity185 " ( " @entity186 " ) through @entity76			2
@entity187 is run by @entity188 , a ph.d. candidate in the @entity189 at the @entity190			0
more than just promoting good music , she says @entity192 is trying to educate , and to challenge the @entity5 embargo on @entity8			0
like @entity8 's rappers , she sees hip hop as a tool for social change			1
as @entity131 puts it , " i think one of the things people take from the music is the idea that we can do anything , we can change anything , we can be anything we want			0

@entity8 's homegrown rap scene is known for its socially *conscious* lyrics
rap groups " @entity10 " and " @entity72 " speak out about life in @entity8
they say hip hop lets them talk about issues ordinary @entity8 can not
