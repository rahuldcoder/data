-- after 21 years of arrests with a side of wisecracks , detective @entity1 will retire wednesday night on " @entity5 : @entity5			1
" @entity6 debuted the role in january 1993 , with @entity9 's " homicide : life on the @entity11			1
" never the star , but usually the character with the best lines , @entity1 survived the cancellation of that show -- and much more			1
between the reprisal of the role on various " @entity5 " spin - offs and his many guest spots in character , @entity6 parlayed @entity1 into one of the longest running roles in tv history			1
as @entity1 , @entity6 appeared on @entity27 's " @entity26 " in 1993 , @entity32 's " @entity31 " in 2002 and shows like " @entity28 , " " @entity29 " and " @entity30			1
" @entity1 appeared in nine different television shows , and that does n't even include the time " @entity40 " turned @entity1 into a muppet to solve alphabet - related crimes in the @entity39 , or when he popped up on " @entity41 " of course , the irony is if you were to design a character who would run for more than two decades on television , you probably would n't create someone like @entity1			1
the original character , like much of " homicide , " was at least partially based on a real - life detective , but @entity1 was given an edge by comedian - turned - actor @entity6			1
the always anti-establishment @entity6 brought a counterculture element to the police precinct with the offbeat detective			2
the romantically challenged , conspiracy theorist , temperamental @entity1 was a cop concerned with civil rights and a penchant for self - deprecation			0
not your typical tv fare			0
which is probably why he endured all these years			0
@entity6 has been enjoying the attention his character 's retirement is getting			2
he 's been tweeting out his thanks , saying , " am i one of the luckiest actors in the world or what ? between my loving fans and an adoring press - i am virtually speechless			0
" though he 's not sure he 'll be able to watch @entity1 's retirement episode because he 'll be too emotional , he 's helpfully suggesting his fans play a drinking game in which they take a swig every time someone says his character 's name during the show			2
fear not , @entity1 fans , this is n't completely the end of the line			0
@entity6 is expected to have a cameo or two on " svu " and another crossover opportunity could present itself down the road			0
( @entity27 's police comedy " @entity87 " seems like a great choice , and it stars former " homicide " castmate @entity89 )			0
at least for one more night , the streets are safe .			0
