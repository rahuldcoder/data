-- when @entity3 gov. @entity2 of @entity4 hits the campaign trail before @entity6 , you might want to listen , because the outcome his re-election bid could have a direct impact on you -- even if you do n't live in his state			2
the number crunchers at @entity12 estimate that next year , @entity4 is going to lose two seats in the @entity15 @entity14			1
it 's up to the @entity4 state government -- including the governor -- to decide which @entity14 members will go : @entity3 or @entity21			1
imagine if , 10 days from now , the @entity21 win control of the @entity14 , but by only a one - seat majority			1
but if a @entity26 holds the governor 's mansion in @entity4 , he could insist that when his state loses two seats , both must be in districts held by @entity21			1
that means just through redistricting in @entity4 alone , the @entity3 could take back control of the @entity14			1
that would affect your life , because everything from education policy to health care and taxes goes through the @entity14 , and which party is in control makes a big difference			1
the balance of power could hinge on who gets elected governor in states far from yours			1
the scenario painted above is highly unlikely -- in part because @entity21 will probably retain control of the @entity53 , and they would force a compromise with their governor			0
but there 's more to this chess game			0
@entity4 is n't the only state that stands to lose seats , and other states will win seats			1
@entity63 , for example , is poised to gain four seats			2
@entity21 control the legislature in @entity66 , and there 's a tight race for the governor 's office			0
@entity71 stands to gain two seats through redistricting			2
@entity21 control the legislature in @entity75 , and there 's a close contest in the gubernatorial race			0
@entity79 is likely to lose one seat			2
@entity3 control both state houses , and a @entity26 is poised to win the governor 's mansion			0
in all , 18 states will gain or lose representation in the @entity14 , totaling a change of 24 seats			1
in most states , it 's all up to the legislature , and the governor vetoes or approves the map			0
some states have a different process to try to minimize political games , but that 's hard			2
" if one party has complete control of the process , they will tilt the table to their favor , so their state will be more likely to elect @entity3 or @entity21 for entire decade , " until redistricting begins again , explains @entity98 professor @entity97 , an expert on the process			1
imagine another scenario : on @entity6 , @entity3 eke out a win and retain control of the @entity14 by five seats			2
but @entity3 lose governors and state legislative races across the country			1
once redistricting happens next year , those elected state officials could wipe out the @entity3 ' majority by adding seats @entity21 will control and eliminating seats @entity3 are certain to control			1
democrats in @entity119 would lose their majority because of politicians elected in a state you 've never even visited			2
sound unfair ? the redistricting process is required by the @entity125 to ensure that every member of the @entity14 has an equal population district			1
it 's the main reason we conduct a @entity130 every 10 years , so we can rebalance districts based on where people are living			0
these new district lines last for 10 years , until the next census			0
when a state has to change even one seat , all the districts in the entire state stand to be redrawn			1
remember , every district has to have population of equal size			0
that means the whole deck is reshuffled			0
there are clever ways to draw districts to ensure that one party or another is all but certain to win there			0
" a long time ago , people figured out you could do more than rebalance populations so politicians can manipulate the boundaries to their favor , " @entity97 said , adding that manipulation for political gain is ingrained into our politics			0
" this is what 's called gerrymandering			0
so the party that controls a state can tilt the balance of power in @entity166 " the origin of " gerrymandering " the list of states that will gain or lose seats is released in december			1
but @entity12 crunched the preliminary census numbers and estimates that the following states will see changes			0
@entity63 will gain four seats , @entity71 will gain two , and @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity166 will each gain one			0
@entity4 and @entity79 will lose two seats , and @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 will each lose one .			0

governors play a big role in the redistricting process
*theoretically* , redistricting could cause a shift in the balance of power
this year , 18 states are expected to gain or lose representation in the @entity14
when a state has to change just one seat , the districts in the state stand to be redrawn
