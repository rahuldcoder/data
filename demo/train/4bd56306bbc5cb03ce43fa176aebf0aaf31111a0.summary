-- growing up in @entity2 , @entity1 spent a lot of time at construction sites			1
back then , the artist was thousands of miles away from an ocean , but that did n't stop him from building castles out of the massive mounds of sand			1
" in the evening when everyone left for work and before the sun set , i 'd find a pile of sand and start making stuff , " he recalls			2
a few decades later , @entity1 is still making sand castles , though today they tend to be much , much more sophisticated			1
his castles resemble less the complicated towers and moats of fairy tales and more the brutalist structures of his architectural inspirations like @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			0
" i always had an affinity for architecture which i attribute to growing up in a neighborhood and town that was constantly under construction , " he says			0
" as i was becoming more aware of the architecture in the wider world , @entity34 was one of the styles of the moment			0
" read more : incredible historical photos from one of the world 's best museums with their exacting geometric shapes and sharp edges , you might think his sculptures require molds or other helpful gizmos			1
but @entity1 , who 's fabricated sculptures for years as an artist 's assistant , has a surprisingly simple tool kit : a 5 - gallon pail to haul water and sand , a plastic placemat for leveling surfaces and a little chunk of plastic for getting those sharp edges			1
" it 's literally a plastic $ 1.50 tool you pick up at a hardware store , " he says			1
the key to getting those precise shapes ( aside from lots of practice , @entity1 says ) is making sure the texture of the sand is just right			1
sand that 's too dry is weak and crumbly			2
too wet , and it 's hard to shape			0
there 's no perfect ratio , but @entity1 explains the ideal texture is similar to the sand you 'd find if you dig about 6 inches down on the beach			1
" it 's easy to pack and will hold long enough to maintain the form			0
" @entity1 shapes everything by hand , roughly packing each piece of a structure and then refining and leveling it with his simple tools			1
this is an entirely different method from the elaborate sandcastles you see in competitions , which are actually made by building an enormous solid block of sand then carving into it like a sculptor does with a hunk of stone			2
carving means dragging and dragging means a rougher , more jagged surface			0
@entity1 's castles are perfectly smooth , like the top of an hand - sanded piece of wood			1
" i 'm really just packing things together like a child might build a sandcastle , " he says			2
" you get a much smoother surface by doing it this way			0
" read more : striking photos of the @entity114 he tends to build his castle right at the edge of the tide , close enough to have easy access to water in case he has to dampen his piles of sand , but far enough to ensure the structures are safe during the building process			1
@entity1 says he 's not attached to his creations , in fact , he likes the idea that they 're temporary			1
" it 's about the process , " he says			0
" building ' sand castles ' is a bit of a test			2
nature will always be against you and time is always running out			0
having to think fast and to bring it all together in the end is what i like about it			0
" each summer , @entity1 has followed a routine : " i walk to @entity150 , take the train out to @entity152 , i walk for 40 minutes so i 'm so far out i can build a castle and have it be there several days later because no one 's bothered it , " he explains			1
but this year things will be a little different			0
the artist is devoting his entire summer to sand projects , and he might even end up with a book of his work sometime later this year			2
" i 'm actually going to spend this summer doing nothing but building sandcastles , " he says			0
" i wo n't be working , except on the beach			0
