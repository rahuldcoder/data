@entity0 -- @entity4 bombing suspect @entity3 was not on a terrorism watch list or a " no - fly " list when he traveled to @entity7 last year , a federal law enforcement official told @entity1 on tuesday			1
the source , who spoke on condition of not being identified , noted the @entity10 found no suspicions of terrorist ties when it interviewed @entity3 and his family members and friends in 2011 after @entity7 asked @entity16 authorities for information on the immigrant from the @entity19			1
because the @entity16 " never deemed him a threat , " @entity3 " was not on a terror watch list or any ' no - fly ' list , " according to the official			2
the information added to questions over the @entity10 's handling of @entity3 , 26 , the older of two brothers accused of setting off two bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the finish line of last week 's @entity33			1
area near @entity4 bomb scene reopens to residents , business owners @entity3 and his brother , @entity38 , also allegedly killed a university policeman on thursday , three days after the bombings , to set off an unprecedented @entity4 - area manhunt			2
@entity3 died after a shootout with police on thursday night , and @entity38 was captured on friday			2
some members of @entity45 have questioned how someone the @entity10 questioned two years earlier because @entity7 was concerned about his shift toward @entity49 extremism could have avoided closer scrutiny since then			1
after being briefed tuesday by @entity10 deputy director @entity51 , the leaders of the @entity53 said they do n't believe the @entity10 " dropped the ball " in its handling of @entity3			1
@entity56 is on @entity10 over handling of bombing suspect however , both @entity60 sen. @entity59 of @entity61 , who chairs the panel , and its top @entity63 , sen. @entity64 of @entity65 , said potential problems revealed by the @entity3 case needed to be addressed			1
@entity64 cited an apparent lack of information - sharing between the federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies , a problem he said was believed to have been remedied in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks almost 12 years ago			1
" we 're going to continue to look at whether or not all of the information was adequately shared , " he told reporters			0
separately , fbi director @entity80 , homeland security secretary @entity81 and @entity82 , director of the @entity83 , briefed @entity85 members on the @entity4 bombings , said @entity87 rep. @entity87			0
none of the legislators who spoke to reporters after the briefings provided details of the ongoing investigation , saying it was too soon to draw conclusions			0
" who knows what will be found tomorrow ? " @entity59 said			0
a focus of the briefings was @entity3 's six - month trip to @entity7 in 2012 that family members said included visits to @entity102 and @entity103 , regions known for radical @entity49 insurgency			2
what was @entity3 doing in @entity7 ? at a hearing earlier on tuesday before the @entity108 , some @entity63 panel members challenged @entity110 about reported discrepancies in the @entity3 case			1
@entity63 sen. @entity113 of @entity114 cited reports that @entity16 authorities were unaware @entity3 had left the country for @entity7 in january 2012 even though his name was misspelled on his airline ticket by @entity7 carrier @entity120 , which would normally trigger increased scrutiny			1
@entity110 responded that @entity3 's departure did " ping " in the homeland security screening system , but she noted that because the @entity10 's investigation in 2011 found no suspicious activity , there was no reason to follow up			1
" there was a missed match there " involving the incorrect spelling of @entity3 's name , @entity110 said , adding that " even with the misspelling , in our current system there are redundancies and so the system did ping when he was leaving the @entity16			2
" the federal law enforcement official told @entity1 that such a hit in the system does n't prompt automatic action			0
in @entity3 's case , the @entity7 government knew he would be traveling to @entity7 and had family there , so there was nothing to follow up , the official said			0
timeline : a look at @entity3 's past @entity1 law enforcement analyst @entity154 , a former @entity10 official , offered a similar explanation tuesday			1
" by the time he comes back , the @entity10 case is closed and , again , no additional information comes back from the @entity7 to keep an eye on him or that he 's on his way back to your country , " @entity154 said			1
" once the @entity10 case is closed , there is no further monitoring by the @entity10 of his activity or whether he 's going to these @entity168 web sites or becoming increasingly radicalized			0
" however , @entity169 sen. @entity169 of @entity170 told @entity1 on tuesday that the episode showed that the @entity172 never notified the @entity10 that @entity3 had left the country			1
" it was clear to me that the homeland security shop had information about the travel to @entity7 , the @entity10 did not , and they 're not talking to each other and they 're going back to the pre- 9/11 problems here , " @entity169 said			1
he also questioned why the @entity10 investigation of @entity3 in 2011 failed to bring his name up as someone to check out in the immediate aftermath of the @entity4 bombings			1
@entity3 and his brother were only identified three days later when authorities released photos and video footage of them at the scene of the blasts			0
" i just find it really unnerving that we could have had him in @entity10 custody in 2011 and did a whole profile of him , and after the attack that his name not surface , that we did n't check the database or the database had him missing , " @entity169 said			0
@entity3 was an immigrant from the volatile @entity19 of southwest @entity7 who had legal residence in the @entity16 and sought last year to become fully naturalized , like his brother @entity38 , 19			0
bombing suspect 's wife ' very distraught ' however , the @entity172 rejected the citizenship request due to the @entity10 questioning before the @entity7 trip			1
an @entity10 statement friday said a foreign government -- later identified by legislators as @entity7 -- asked for information on @entity3 " based on information that he was a follower of radical @entity49 and a strong believer , and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the @entity16 for travel to the country 's region to join unspecified underground groups			1
" in response , the @entity10 said , it " checked @entity16 government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications , possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity , associations with other persons of interest , travel history and plans , and education history			1
" " the @entity10 also interviewed @entity3 and family members , " said the @entity10 statement			1
" the @entity10 did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011			0
" in addition , the @entity10 " requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government , " its statement said			2
the lengthy travel to @entity7 by @entity3 , who 's ethnically @entity247 but came to the @entity16 from @entity248 , caused some legislators and analysts to speculate he may have received training during the trip			2
dead @entity4 bomb suspect posted video of jihadist , analysis shows @entity154 detailed how the @entity10 employs what amounts to " triage " to deal with what he said were tens of thousands of similar inquiries a year that require some level of bureau investigation			2
" if you are getting this from a hot place like @entity267 or the tribal area of @entity269 or places where we have had specific training camps and people deployed on purpose to come and attack us , then that is the highest priority , " he said			0
" and even there , many of the people that go back and forth are visiting family			0
i mean , they are not always going back to be trained to be terrorists or always going back for refresher courses on terrorism			0
" regarding @entity7 , @entity154 noted the ongoing conflict with @entity247 separatists that may have caused @entity286 's request for information on @entity3			2
5 key questions in @entity4 bombing probe " that 's been an ongoing fight , but it 's been localized , " he said , adding that he could n't recall a case in which a @entity102 trained at home came to attack the @entity16			0
however , @entity154 noted that @entity294 had sent people to the @entity19 for training that included bomb building			0
@entity298 : what we know about @entity102 now @entity16 investigators need to find out if the @entity305 " had connections , were they deployed by a bigger group , and are there other terrorists in the @entity16 , " @entity154 said			0
" are there other explosive devices hidden somewhere or booby traps created , a cache of weapons ? " he wondered			0
" that 'll be the task			0
" @entity314 : suspects ' culture of migration and machismo @entity1 's @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .			0
