they blamed injuries and the rules of the competition for the controversy			0
" we were injured before the match , " @entity10 wrote			1
" and we were using the rule to give up the match to be better prepared for the knockout round			0
do you know how much pain we suffer when we athletes get injured and still have to compete ? " she said the federation 's decision to disqualify them had " dashed our dreams			2
" at 26 , @entity10 is relatively young to be leaving the sport			1

the @entity3 @entity90 delegation " fully respects the @entity13 's decision to punish " its athletes , it said in a statement			2

" the @entity34 eventually won the " repeatedly interrupted match , " securing first place in their group , according to the news service			0

" i 've never seen any sporting event , any major event , where two players or two pairs just stood on a court and have n't tried			0

" these players , i feel for them a little bit , because this was n't their decision ; their team has told them to lose these games , " he said			1
the world champion @entity3 pair , @entity18 and @entity10 , " were going for gold , and this was just part of their journey to get to that gold			1
" they probably did n't see anything wrong with what they did because they were focused on the next round and winning medals for their country , he said			0

@entity292 , the chairman of the @entity90 organizing committee , was clear where he stood on the controversy , describing the spectacle as " depressing " and " unacceptable			0
" " i mean , who wants to sit through something like that ? " he asked			0
