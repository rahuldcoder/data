@entity0 -- in a further escalation of tensions between @entity3 and @entity7 , at least three @entity3 diplomats are being expelled from the @entity3 embassy in @entity9 , @entity3 officials said wednesday			1
the @entity3 consulate , however , appears to be unaffected by the @entity7 downgrade of diplomatic relations with @entity3			1
" consulates and embassies are not in the same status , " said @entity13 of the @entity3 consulate in @entity0			1
" there are treaties that define what consulates are supposed to do			0
the personnel that are being expelled are from the embassy			0
as of now , we have not heard anything from the @entity7 foreign ministry regarding expulsion of any of the consulate personnel			0
" on tuesday , @entity7 's fiery prime minister compared @entity9 's once - close ally in the @entity32 to a " spoiled boy " and announced additional sanctions would soon be imposed			0
" we are completely suspending all of these , trade relations , military relations , related with the defense industry , " @entity35 said , according to the semi-official @entity36			1
" all of these are completely suspended and other measures will follow this process			0
" asked to clarify whether this meant @entity7 will halt more than $ 3 billion in bilateral trade , an official in the @entity7 prime ministry , speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol , insisted @entity35 was not referring to trade relations			1
" he was referring to the defense industry , " the official said			0
" nothing more than the measures that have been announced so far			0
" last week , @entity7 declared it was downgrading relations with @entity3 , suspending all military agreements between the two countries and giving senior @entity3 diplomats less than a week to leave @entity7 territory			1
" if the current steps are regarded as ' plan b , ' there will be a ' plan c , ' " @entity35 said on tuesday in his first public comments on the matter since @entity9 imposed sanctions on @entity3			1
@entity35 's government is incensed that @entity3 refuses to apologize or pay compensation for eight slain @entity7 and one @entity67			1
the humanitarian workers and activists were shot dead by @entity3 commandos in a botched 2010 raid on an aid convoy that was trying to bust @entity3 's sea blockade of @entity74			1
but " @entity3 does not want to see a further deterioration in the relationship with @entity7 , " said a senior @entity3 government official , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			1
" there have been a number of proposals on the table to prevent a deterioration and unfortunately they have not been successful , but from our point of view a deterioration in the relationship serves neither side 's interests			0
" multiple @entity3 sources said they are doing what they can to be responsible and reverse the negative dynamic			1
some @entity3 officials believe the current troubles between the two countries are minor bumps that can be smoothed out with time and the proper diplomacy			1
others believe the deteriorating relationship has little to do with @entity3 and more to do with a reorientation of @entity7 foreign policy towards the @entity106 world			2
a possible @entity35 trip to @entity74 is contributing to that school of thought			2
diplomats in @entity111 and @entity9 tell @entity1 that @entity35 is tentatively scheduled to visit @entity111 next week			0
there is growing speculation in local media that the @entity7 prime minister may try to visit @entity74 via @entity118 's @entity117 border crossing			2
" this is a process that will continue until the last moment , " @entity35 said tuesday , according to @entity36 , when asked about a trip to @entity74			2
" we will make the final decision there , talking to our @entity118 friends and brothers			0
according to that , there may be a trip to @entity74			2
" despite deteriorating political relations between @entity132 and @entity9 , trade has grown substantially between the two countries over the last year , according to @entity7 government statistics			2
on monday , @entity135 , governor of the @entity136 , gave a speech in which he highlighted the importance of @entity3 's economic ties with @entity7			2
he noted that @entity7 's economy was the largest in the region , with a gross domestic product in excess of $ 700 billion , and that @entity7 is becoming a key player in regional trade			0
@entity7 is a significant @entity3 trading partner , @entity146 said , and damage to the trade relationship between the two countries could have serious consequences for @entity3			1
@entity151 , @entity152 - based editor at @entity153 and expert on @entity7 - @entity3 relations , argues the @entity32 " outsider " status that once drew @entity7 and @entity3 together into an alliance during the 1990s has changed , as @entity7 has grown economically and established closer political ties with @entity160 neighbors			1
" the paths have diverged , " @entity151 said			0
" what you have left is two countries with different visions currently for their position in the region			0
so @entity7 wants to build a more unified region with more open borders that ultimately helps trade and ultimately helps @entity7 see itself as a regional leader			0
@entity3 sees itself as isolated in the region , increasingly threatened and increasingly concerned with security issues			0
" prior to the report about @entity35 's comments tuesday , @entity174 , a senior @entity3 defense official , told @entity3 radio that despite the reports , @entity7 is not disengaging from @entity3			1
contrary to what is being reported , he said , the @entity3 military attache to @entity7 is continuing his work there .			0

the @entity3 consulate appears to be unaffected
" consulates and embassies are not in the same status , " an official says
an official says trade relations will not be suspended
the tension stems from a 2010 raid on a @entity74 aid convoy
