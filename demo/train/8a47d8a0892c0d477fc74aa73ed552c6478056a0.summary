-- imagine a new plague racing unchecked across the continent , littering the land with human corpses covered with peeling red blemishes			2
but it equally ravages horses , dogs , cats , monkeys -- every mammal in its path			0
now be glad you 're not a newt , a salamander or a frog -- particularly two species of frogs called @entity21 's frogs named after @entity21			1
because one of them is now extinct and the other endangered , scientists say			1
a hyper - aggressive fungus with some changed up @entity26 is infecting and killing amphibians , and has done in hordes of these frogs , according to a new study published last week in the scientific journal @entity31			1
one of the species , @entity33 , was last seen in the wild in 1980			1
its close cousin , @entity37 , which @entity21 first discovered on his sailing voyage around the world in the 1830s , is endangered			1
a few groups of them still live in temperate forests in @entity44 , in @entity45 , where @entity21 found them back then			1
but now , they are just hanging on			0
what the disease has not done to kill them , human activity , including tree farming , has			1
in addition to the distinction of bearing the name of the author of the theory of evolution , the frogs are also the only vertebrates aside from sea horses , in which the male of the species sort of gets pregnant			1
" the males care for their young by incubating them in their vocal sacs for at least part of their development , " the study says			0
the result is a baby bump			0
the frogs represent merely canaries in the mine as far as the disease is concerned			0
virtually all amphibians can catch it			2
the fungus -- batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in scientific lingo -- causes a nasty infection			2
it is called chytridiomycosis , and scientists have said that it is " the worst infectious disease ever recorded among vertebrates in terms of the number of species impacted and its propensity to drive them to extinction			2
" and the fungus is genetically flexible			2
there are many strains of it , with the possibility of new ones popping up			0
the most virulent one has recombinant dna			0
it 's basically a mutant			0

aggressive fungus *wiping* out amphibians worldwide
it has made some species extinct , including a frog species named for @entity21
there is another @entity21 frog that is now endangered
the male of the species sort of gets pregnant , the way *seahorses* do
