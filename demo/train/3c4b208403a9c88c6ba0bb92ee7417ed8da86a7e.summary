@entity0 -- if you want to understand the historical magnitude of president @entity5 's re-election victory , start with this fact : he lost the white vote by 20 points			1
in 1988 , @entity10 lost white voters by 19 points			0
he was crushed in a 40 - state landslide			0
@entity5 's victory is a testament to a changing @entity16			1
the president won a second term in the face of a weak economy by reassembling the bulk of his 2008 coalition : hispanics , african - americans , younger voters and single women			2
@entity28 's support was older , whiter , and more @entity29 than the president 's -- a faded shadow of a time gone by			1
it also bore a striking resemblance to sen. @entity36 's coalition four years ago			1
re-election puts @entity5 to the test a few specifics : @entity5 won @entity41 voters by nearly 40 points -- a slightly larger margin than his total over @entity36 four years ago -- while the @entity41 share of the total vote crept up from 9 % to 10 %			1
@entity28 's tough talk on illegal immigration and self - deportation may have helped him win the @entity51 nomination , but it cost him in the fall			1
see data on who voted for whom black voters were 13 % of the total electorate , the same share as in 2008 but a bump up from typical modern turnout levels			0
the first black president 's share of the black vote actually dropped a couple of points , but was still far north of 90 %			0
talk of black alienation because of resistance on issues like same - sex marriage was overblown			0
voters age 18 to 29 comprised a slightly larger share of the electorate than in 2008 , an outcome contrary to the media narrative of a disenchanted youth alienated from the political process			0
@entity5 's share of the young vote declined a bit , but he still won it well in excess of 20 points			1
what we learned from the election in the final days before the election , hopeful @entity51 played up polls showing @entity28 running away with the independent vote			2
it did n't pan out			0
@entity28 won independents by 4 % -- a healthy 12 - point swing for the @entity51 compared to 2008 -- but it was n't nearly enough to save the former @entity94 governor			1
republicans also hoped a 7 - point @entity98 @entity97 turnout edge over the @entity51 in 2008 would shrivel this time around			2
@entity98 maintained a 6 - point edge on tuesday			0
in the critical @entity102 state of @entity103 , @entity5 may have been saved by the 2009 auto industry bailout			0
@entity103 voters approved of the bailout by a 23 - point margin , and bailout supporters in the @entity103 backed the president over @entity28 by about 50 points			0
@entity5 makes history again perhaps in a related vein , @entity5 won 42 % of working class whites in @entity103 , compared to 36 % of working class whites nationwide -- a critical difference in the tightly contested state			2
where does the @entity51 go from here ? the @entity51 brand remains extremely strong among southern whites and religious voters in particular			0
conservative leaders can find solace both in their tightening grip on the @entity125 and a promising political bench featuring rising stars like @entity129 rep. @entity128 , @entity131 sen. @entity130 , @entity133 gov. @entity132 and @entity135 gov. @entity134 , to name just a few			0
but even the most cursory glance at the results of the past two presidential elections makes it clear that the @entity51 is now facing a growing demographic problem			1
it risks permanently losing a new generation of @entity16 -- a generation central to @entity5 's twin @entity144 victories			1
how @entity51 address this problem will play a huge role in determining the shape of @entity16 politics long after @entity5 himself has exited the political stage			1
analysis : @entity5 won with a better ground game			2

@entity5 's victory is a testament to a changing @entity16
@entity28 's coalition bore a striking resemblance to @entity36 's four years ago
@entity28 won a small majority of independents , but not enough to make a difference
results show @entity51 party facing a demographics problem
