-- the @entity1 might only have 55 human inhabitants , but the waters surrounding them are teeming with marine life			1
a new study by the @entity6 in partnership with the @entity8 has revealed the glorious extent of the biodiversity in this remote corner of the @entity12			2
a team of scientists led by marine ecologist @entity15 completed more than 450 dives at 97 locations earlier this year as well as lowering cameras down to depths of 1,600 meters in a further 17 spots			0
along with more than 250 species of fish , 70 species of coral and more than 60 varieties of algae were observed around the four islands ( @entity1 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 ) that make up the @entity31			1
to date , nearly 1,250 marine species ( including seabirds ) have been found in the area , but scientists believe many more remain undiscovered			1

" there are only a handful of @entity51 of the world that remain pristine occupying less than 5 % of the ocean , " the report says			2
" these places allow us to know what the ocean was like before heavy human impacts ... and most important , to set proper conservation and management goals for our oceans			1
