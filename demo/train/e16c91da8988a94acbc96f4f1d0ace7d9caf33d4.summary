-- since @entity3 's death was announced on monday , many people have marveled at the mourning scenes featured on @entity6 state television , made viral on the @entity7 : @entity6 prostrate , weeping , hitting the ground			1
many have asked whether the anguish is genuine			0
how could citizens mourn the passing of a totalitarian , such a gross abuser of human rights ? the answer may be found in the human rights abuses themselves			1
it is a lamentable characteristic of totalitarian regimes that they often demand acts of deceit from those they oppress			0
often it is a matter of simple survival			0
those who hate the regime are obliged to demonstrate patriotism			1
to fail is to risk persecution			0
the only alternative is to flee , a choice made by tens of thousands of @entity6 in the past two decades			1
@entity6 is unambiguously a totalitarian state			1
an estimated 200,000 @entity6 are held under brutal conditions in remote forced labor camps called kwan - li - so			1
citizens are deprived of the freedom to speak , to dissent , to assemble , to seek remedies for grievances			0
perhaps worst of all , there is no freedom from fear -- knowing that one can be imprisoned and tortured for minor trifles , sent to a kwan - li - so for being related to someone who displeased the state , or face a kangaroo court trial and possible public execution for a long list of political or economic " crimes			0
" even those who manage to keep out of trouble suffer from the government 's deadly economic mismanagement and a " military first " policy : death from famines , widespread stunting in children from persistent malnutrition and untreated illness			1
it is difficult for many @entity6 to obtain adequate money or food without committing acts that are criminal or , given the crackdown on economic crimes , potentially suicidal			1
for many , to live in @entity6 is to live in fear for one 's very existence			1
in a context like this , there is no way to know what is genuine and what is theatrical			0
totalitarianism and fear impair the idea of truth and the concept of objectivity			0
rather than focusing on the televised tears of mourners for @entity3 , we should be asking what needs to be done to ensure that someday @entity6 television will show the tears of the fathers , mothers and children who have seen their relatives suffer or die because of the acts and omissions of @entity3 and his father , @entity95 , before him , during their unbroken 63 - year rule			1
the " @entity103 , " @entity103 , is still largely untested and doubts persist about whether he is really in charge in @entity100 , but many hope that change is more likely now than a week ago			0
the international community should use this transition period to press the new leader to break from the criminal tyranny of the past and steer the country in a new direction			0
@entity103 could start by taking note of calls made in the latest @entity114 resolution on @entity6 , and allowing a visit by @entity114 special rapporteurs			2
@entity117 needs to come to @entity6 , in one form or another			2
those who will lead @entity6 now , @entity103 and the generals and ministers who control the state apparatus , need to remember that history has not been kind to tyrants			2
totalitarian regimes can linger , and often do , but ultimately gross injustices are unsustainable and those who commit them can ( and now often do ) face the punishments of international justice			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			2

many wonder if @entity6 ' grief over the death of @entity3 is genuine , says @entity133
@entity139 : how could citizens mourn the passing of such a gross abuser of human rights ?
in a totalitarian *society* , those who hate the regime are obliged to show patriotism , he says
for many , to live in @entity6 is to live in fear for one 's very existence , @entity133 says
