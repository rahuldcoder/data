-- a @entity2 congressman is questioning whether the @entity3 failed to hold the @entity4 accountable during a 2012 academic fraud investigation and is demanding answers from @entity3 brass			1
if he does n't get them , he 'll call for congressional hearings and subpoena @entity3 president @entity11 , rep. @entity8 told @entity0			2
the @entity14 @entity13 is referring to a probe in which the @entity3 investigated @entity4 's system of " paper classes " -- independent studies requiring little work and no attendance			1
athletes were able to get easy " a " s without actually going to class			2
the @entity3 declined to sanction the university , saying the scandal was academic in nature , not athletic			1
however , whistle - blower @entity26 has said that paper classes were openly discussed as a way to keep athletes eligible to play , and former football player @entity31 said he was forced into majoring in african - american studies , the department at the heart of the paper - classes scandal			1
" i think it 's important to know if they are looking the other way , " @entity8 said			0
" i think it 's very suspicious			0
" @entity0 analysis : some college athletes play like adults , read like 5th - graders @entity8 ' call for an explanation could have implications for the @entity3 , as it 's involved in three court cases aiming to dissolve the long - standing amateur model and give players more rights -- and possibly salaries			1
meanwhile , the @entity53 has filed a complaint with the @entity2 @entity55 over @entity4 's paper classes			1
the student - athlete advocacy group , based in @entity58 , @entity4 , alleges the classes violated @entity60 because the number of male students taking them was disproportionate , and @entity63 because too many black students took them			1
as more critics are emerging and speaking publicly about the way the @entity3 handled the @entity4 case , the @entity3 is standing by its assertion that athletes are paid with an education , are students first and should not receive salaries			1
critics say that model is flawed because many athletes do not get an education			0
" kids who are walking out of these schools can not read			0
they are getting degrees that are worthless , " said @entity79 , a former congressman and basketball player who now serves as secretary for the @entity82 , speaking on the issue of @entity3 reform last week at the nonprofit @entity85			1
" i think the chink in the armor of the @entity3 is that they say you 're going to get an education			2
" in a monday phone interview with @entity0 , @entity92 stated his opinion succinctly : " if these kids are n't getting an education , the whole thing 's a sham			0
" @entity99 , a former @entity3 adviser and current head of the @entity53 , raised the same point in a letter to @entity11 asking for a renewed investigation at @entity4			1
@entity104 said he believes the @entity3 and @entity4 are ignoring the alleged academic fraud to protect the amateur model			1
if the @entity3 were to admit that athletes are not getting an education , it would be devastating to the organization , @entity104 said			2
two former college athletic officials - turned - reform advocates -- @entity113 at the @entity114 and @entity115 at the @entity116 -- also recently began reviewing academic fraud cases for which the @entity3 handed down punishments , comparing them to @entity4			1
they believe the data will demonstrate that the @entity3 is ignoring the problem			2
" they do pick and choose , " @entity115 said			0
" the @entity3 is abdicating their responsibility , and there is a clear and convincing case of academic fraud the @entity3 is overlooking			2
" but the @entity3 's investigation is over despite recent revelations from @entity31 and @entity26 's public statements			1
when reached for comment , the @entity3 said its " rules only govern academic fraud as it relates to athletics departments and student - athletes			1
any broader issue is not under the @entity3 's purview			1
" in 2012 , the @entity3 did go to @entity137 to investigate			2
it was alleged that about a dozen players had dealings with agents -- a big @entity3 violation			2
then , information surfaced suggesting one of the most prestigious public universities in the country had been passing athletes through classes that they never had to attend			2
there was talk that the allegations could deliver a devastating blow to the institution , perhaps even going back to its 2005 and 2009 basketball championships			0
but that did n't happen			0
while the football team had to vacate wins and forgo scholarships because of the agent scandal , little came of the academic fraud probe			0
the @entity3 came to town , punished a few players and left , finding no evidence of institutional fraud			2
@entity26 was never contacted or interviewed , and @entity4 was left to police itself			2
the school instituted more than 180 reforms to make sure paper classes did not continue			1
but no one asked why : why did @entity4 need to create these easy - a classes ? who came up with the idea ? who knew about it ? @entity31 was one of the players caught up in the scandal			1
a defensive end recruit with numerous @entity176 coaches trying to woo him , @entity31 chose @entity4 , not just to play ball , but because he wanted to major in criminal justice			2
he wanted an education , he said			0
" when the coaches and academic staff came to my house all the way in @entity185 , you know they was n't even talking football			0
they was talking academics , " @entity31 said			0
" so they were saying , ' you know what ? we ca n't promise your son that he 's going to go to the @entity195 , but one thing that we can promise him is that he will get a college degree			0
' " they did n't make good on that promise , he said			0
on his second day of school , athletic advising handed him a schedule and told him what classes he 'd be taking			0
none of them was related to criminal justice			0
instead , there was an @entity210 , something @entity31 says he had no interest in			0
he felt " lied to , " he said			0
when the academic fraud scandal broke , the @entity3 said one of @entity31 's tutors had done too much work for him			1
" the university knew what was going on and they knew i was taking paper classes and they kind of swept it under the rug , " he said			1
he was declared academically ineligible , and right before his senior season , he says he felt forced to leave @entity4			2
and after a short stint with the @entity222 , he went to the @entity223 , where he 's now playing			0
@entity31 and his attorney , former @entity225 @entity224 , say they feel like the @entity3 picked on @entity31 while ignoring the larger institutional problem			2
" the individual players were singled out , " @entity224 said			0
" literally thrown under the bus , in my opinion , by the way the enforcement process works , and i think the university hoped and the @entity3 was compliant with the sense of ' ok , we 've punished the players			0
' " @entity4 has long insisted that the paper classes were solely the idea of one man -- now - indicted professor @entity240 , who was head of the @entity241			1
two internal reviews commissioned by the university found there was no evidence that counselors or anyone in the athletics department knew about the abuse			0
@entity4 's athletic reform chairwoman @entity251 told @entity0 that she believes the students found the easy classes by word of mouth and that @entity4 officials were stunned as to why @entity257 would offer paper classes			1
@entity31 says that 's not true , and @entity26 told @entity0 that paper classes were openly discussed within the athletics department as a way to keep athletes eligible			1
" in the building , almost everyone would have talked about it , " she said , referring to working in athletics			0
" and outside of the athletic department , some other people that were involved in advising certainly knew about the paper class system			0
" @entity26 , who has studied athlete literacy for years and has personally worked with the athletes who were part of her study , previously told @entity0 for an exclusive story that there are athletes at @entity4 who are reading at elementary school levels			1
some of the athletes who were pushed into paper classes were put there because they were n't reading at high enough levels to succeed in legitimate courses at @entity4 , she said			1
there are athletes -- including some who played on the 2009 championship basketball team -- who took as many as 12 paper classes , @entity26 said , adding that it 's telling that one key indicator of graduation rates dropped significantly once the paper classes were uncovered and brought to an end			1
" they were used for students who were in the @entity3 tournament			0
they were used for students who were going to world competition , like soccer players			0
they were used for the @entity303 , " @entity26 said of the paper classes			1
" they were used for summer classes for students who were playing baseball on the coast			0
they were used for students who were having eligibility issues			0
" @entity4 officials have attacked @entity26 's credibility and disavowed her research , saying of her research suggesting some athletes read at elementary school levels : " we do not believe that claim and find it patently unfair to the many student - athletes who have worked hard in the classroom and on the court and represented our university with distinction			1
" but since she spoke to @entity0 , @entity4 has commissioned yet another investigation of the paper classes scandal			1
this time , @entity324 , a former homeland security adviser to president @entity325 , is doing the review			0
he has already spoken to @entity26 and @entity327 , @entity240 's secretary , and has talked to @entity327 about the other people in athletics who were aware of paper classes , according to @entity327 's attorney			1
while @entity240 faces a criminal fraud charge , the district attorney announced earlier this year that @entity327 will not be charged , and unless more information is revealed , the active investigation is over .			0
