@entity0 -- in what amounted to political theater rather than legislative action , the @entity2 on wednesday rejected a @entity7 budget plan that included a controversial provision to overhaul @entity9 and also unanimously voted down president @entity11 's 2012 budget proposal			1
the @entity7 budget measure had been expected to fail in the @entity2 due to overwhelming opposition by majority democrats , plus wavering support for its @entity9 overhaul among @entity17			1
the @entity2 @entity17 has recognized the provision 's unpopularity with senior citizens enrolled in the government - run health insurance program			1
@entity23 forced wednesday 's vote in order to make @entity2 @entity17 go on record in support of the @entity9 overhaul			1
the final vote on the proposal originated by @entity32 chairman @entity31 , @entity33 , was 57 - 40 , mostly along party lines			2
republicans who joined the majority @entity23 in opposing the measure were @entity38 of @entity39 , @entity40 of @entity41 , @entity42 of @entity43 , and @entity44 and @entity45 of @entity46			0
three senators did n't vote -- republicans @entity48 of @entity49 and @entity50 of @entity51 , and @entity53 @entity52 of @entity54			0
in a later retaliatory vote forced by @entity17 , the @entity2 achieved rare bipartisan unanimity in rejecting @entity11 's budget plan on a 97 - 0 vote			1
@entity23 joined @entity17 in opposing the plan to signal they wanted a stronger deficit reduction proposal than what the president offered			1
the @entity2 then defeated two other @entity17 budget plans offered by conservative newcomers @entity67 of @entity68 and @entity42			2
@entity31 's plan , which won approval in the @entity7 due to strong @entity17 support , drew the most attention of the proposals defeated wednesday because of its provision to rework @entity9 starting in 2022			1
on tuesday , @entity23 won a special election for a @entity78 @entity7 seat from @entity79 formerly considered safe @entity17 territory , and the @entity17 @entity9 plan was the central issue of the campaign			1
under the @entity31 proposal , the government would no longer directly pay health care bills for senior citizens in the program , starting in 2022			1
instead , recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers , which the federal government would subsidize			0
people now 55 or older would not be affected by the changes			0
the budget proposal also would slash non-military discretionary spending and reform @entity98 , the government - run health insurance program for the poor and disabled			1
@entity17 call @entity31 's proposal a courageous attempt to address runaway spending that must be corralled to bring down rising deficits and a ballooning national debt			2
@entity108 chairman @entity107 blasted @entity23 for stopping " at nothing to preserve the status quo in @entity0 , which is propelling our country towards bankruptcy			0
" @entity107 ' remarks reflected the fact that the question of how to tackle the growth of hugely popular entitlement programs -- including @entity9 , @entity98 and @entity119 -- has now become one of the central battlegrounds in the national political arena			0
democrats , however , contend republicans seek to reduce deficits on the backs of the elderly and the poor by essentially ending @entity9 as it now operates			2
they note the @entity9 overhaul will cost senior citizens an average of roughly $ 6,000 more per year for health care			1
" the @entity17 plan would kill @entity9 , " senate majority leader @entity133 , @entity134 , said wednesday			2
@entity23 pointed to the @entity54 special election results on tuesday as evidence that the @entity78 people , especially senior citizens , do n't agree with the @entity17 approach			1
in the election , @entity140 , the @entity141 clerk of @entity142 , swept to victory in the race to fill the @entity7 seat previously held by @entity17 @entity147 in a district controlled by the @entity17 for more than four decades			0
during @entity140 's victory speech tuesday night , jubilant supporters repeatedly chanted " @entity9 ! @entity9 ! " @entity140 pledged to help balance the budget " the right way , not on backs of our seniors			2
" throughout the campaign , @entity140 highlighted the national fight , telling @entity1 that her @entity17 opponent , @entity158 , had " 100 % embraced " the plan			2
@entity160 called @entity162 's message " scare tactics , " and had argued that @entity140 was " trying to put out the idea that i 'm trying to end @entity9			2
" " there 's nothing further from the truth , " @entity160 insisted			0
" i 'm working to protect @entity9			0
" moments after @entity162 's victory was announced , rep. @entity169 of @entity170 , the newly installed head of the @entity171 , declared that the outcome of the race proves " republicans and independent voters , along with @entity23 , will reject extreme policies			0
" on wednesday morning , @entity179 , executive director of the @entity180 , released a statement arguing that the results " provide clear evidence that @entity23 will be able to play offense in @entity2 races across the country by remaining focused on the @entity17 effort to end @entity9			1
" for their part , @entity17 leaders minimized the importance of the race			0
among other things , they pointed to the presence of a conservative third - party candidate in the race whose support apparently exceeded @entity140 's margin of victory			0
@entity17 sen. @entity197 of @entity198 said his party has to promote its budget policies and the @entity9 overhaul proposal instead of voting for it and then absorbing @entity141 attacks			1
" the talking point is there was a third - party candidate who drew 12 % and spent $ 2 million , " @entity197 said of the @entity54 race , adding that supporters of the @entity210 in the @entity7 and @entity2 now " need to get out there and aggressively get on offense and explain it to the @entity78 people			0
" to @entity197 , the @entity17 made a courageous vote and now @entity23 are " starting to lob grenades at us and everybody 's starting to duck and run for cover			1
" " i do n't think that 's the way you engage in a fight , " @entity197 said			0
" we have to get out there and fight			0
" senate minority leader @entity224 , @entity225 , said the real problem is that @entity23 have failed to propose or pass a budget proposal for last year or this one			1
" this is a complete and total abdication of their responsibilities , " @entity228 said			0
to hit back at @entity23 , @entity228 forced votes wednesday on the other three budget measures , including @entity11 's 2012 budget proposal			1
@entity228 sought to force @entity23 to publicly oppose @entity11 's plan and to also reject other @entity17 proposals in order to portray them as obstructing any progress on cutting deficits			1
in a bit of political irony , @entity17 leaders last year repeatedly attacked the health care reform law pushed through by @entity23 , arguing that it would weaken @entity9			1
@entity17 congressional candidates crushed their @entity141 counterparts among voters age 65 and older in the november congressional elections , carrying seniors by a 21 - point margin			0
whether @entity17 can now successfully defend @entity31 's plan , which is a virtual litmus test for their conservative base , without scaring older voters remains to be seen			2
former house speaker @entity254 , now a presidential candidate , was recently excoriated by conservative activists for calling @entity31 's plan a form of objectionable " right - wing social engineering			0
" @entity259 has since backed away from his remarks and expressed support for the proposal			0
@entity1 's @entity263 contributed to this story .			0
