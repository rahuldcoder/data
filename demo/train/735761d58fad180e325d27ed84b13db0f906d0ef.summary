-- picture a mansion on an estate that , before the @entity3 , was a thriving @entity4 cotton plantation			0
entering the lavish home is a tall , lanky , bearded man wearing a suit and a stovepipe hat			0
sound familiar ? next , another man dressed as @entity10 arrives -- also tall and bearded -- with the same hat			1
yep , what we have here is an honest - to - goodness convention of @entity19 lookalikes			1
photographer @entity20 documented this annual meeting of the @entity22 in april			1
his images remind us how iconic the 16th @entity24 continues to be , 149 years after his assassination			0
" it was certainly quirky , " said @entity20 , who especially enjoyed reactions the @entity27 would get in public by people who were n't part of the group			1
" they 'd be surprised to see one @entity10			1
then , once they realized there were 20 more of them , it was like , ' oh my @entity38 ! ' " the @entity27 were joined by other lookalikes of the same era , including women dressed as first lady @entity42 , complete with petticoats and huge , colorful gowns			2
after arriving at the mansion at @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , some of the @entity46 unbuttoned their long suit coats and sat down for dinner			1
@entity20 photographed the group at the dining room table			1
" a lot of the conversation was just them catching up about their kids and grandkids , " @entity20 said			1
" there was this air of history hanging over the conversation because of the setting -- and because of their costumes			0
" actually , @entity20 gets paid to photograph the real @entity24			1
as a photojournalist with @entity69 credentials , he regularly takes news assignments that put him in the @entity71 just a few feet from president @entity72			0
@entity20 's trip down south was part of a larger project surrounding conventions in general			1
" the idea is to look at people sort of gathering around their interests , " he explained			0
" when they come together -- when they kind of join their flock -- i find a certain honesty in those moments			0
i hope the pictures that i 'm making reveal the community they 're creating around this particular interest			0
" @entity20 has photographed plenty of @entity3 battle re-enactments			1
you might say the @entity19 convention is a geekier kind of re-enactment -- for political history buffs			2
" by and large they take their roles fairly seriously , " he said			0
" in general , everybody was in their suit and top hat for four days			0
in one of @entity20 's favorite images from the shoot , an " @entity110 " steals a kiss from a " @entity42 " outside a hotel ballroom			1
" it 's a very human moment -- a very honest interaction between husband and wife , " he said			2
" and it happens to be that they 're dressed as these historical characters			0
" the convention came with jarring visual anachronisms			2
for example , it was impossible to ignore the sight of @entity10 on a cell phone			1
and two @entity27 using digital cameras to snap photos of each other is n't something you see every day			2
the convention also provoked stark observations			2
in fact , the irony of an ex-slave plantation hosting an event honoring the man who freed @entity135 's slaves was n't lost on @entity20			1
" they had a little patch of cotton on the property where people who go on tours can actually pick cotton , " @entity20 said			1
some of the re-enactors decided to try it			0
" it was weird seeing a bunch of @entity148 gathered around picking cotton , " he said			0
also during the plantation tour , one conventioneer -- portraying @entity152 abolitionist leader @entity151 -- commented about the trees in the area			0
" i wonder if anyone was ever hung from these branches			0
these trees could tell some stories , " @entity20 recalled the man saying			2
the comment , @entity20 said , " gave a broader context to this gathering -- that there was so much history that gets ignored or brushed under the table when we see a person portraying @entity10 ... or we go to a @entity3 re-enactment			1
it 's a very thin slice of the reality of those people 's lives at that time			0
" " it was n't a morbid observation , i think it was a very honest one , " @entity20 said			2
" there 's a lot that we do n't know , that does n't get talked about -- certainly from that time period -- that should be			0
