the eruption of fighting in @entity3 's @entity2 is causing much consternation and recrimination in @entity7 foreign policy circles			1
conservative hawks , including sens. @entity9 and @entity10 , are especially vocal in criticizing the @entity13 administration 's @entity3 policy			1
they argue that the administration 's fecklessness has opened @entity3 to an @entity18 offensive that now has the terrorist group 's flag flying over portions of @entity22 and @entity23 , two cities subdued during the @entity26 administration at great cost in blood and treasure			2
if @entity13 had not foolishly withdrawn the remaining @entity7 troops from @entity3 at the end of 2011 , hawkish critics insist , @entity30 would now have far greater ability to prevent the country 's alarming slide into turmoil			1
there are several problems with that argument			0
first , it was @entity26 , not @entity13 , who negotiated the original agreement with @entity3 prime minister @entity43 that promised the full withdrawal of @entity7 forces by the end of 2011			1
the @entity13 administration would have had either to renege on a formal agreement , thus displaying contempt for the sovereignty of a democratic @entity3 that the @entity7 helped create , or somehow induce the @entity43 government to sign a new agreement allowing @entity7 troops to remain			1
second , @entity13 administration officials did try to negotiate a new " status of forces " agreement to enable a limited number of troops ( perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 ) to stay in @entity3			1
however , @entity43 insisted the only way he would even consider approving such a pact would be if @entity30 agreed that @entity7 forces were subject to @entity3 law			2
the @entity7 government , under both @entity62 and @entity63 presidents , has been wary of consenting to such provisions even in stable , @entity67 democratic countries that host @entity7 troops			1
the @entity7 has steadfastly refused to do so in countries like @entity3 with shaky , corrupt political systems and dubious legal systems			2
one ought to ask hawks if they believe @entity13 should have exposed @entity7 military personnel to the tender mercies of @entity3 's court system			1
if not , they must concede that @entity13 adopted the right position in refusing to make such a concession			0
third , the idea of keeping @entity7 troops in @entity3 was profoundly unpopular among both @entity3 and @entity7			1
public opinion polls taken in 2011 showed a clear majority of @entity7 believed the @entity85 was a mistake and did not want @entity7 forces to stay in that country			0
likewise , by rather wide margins , @entity90 and @entity91 @entity89 populations ( who vehemently disagreed about numerous issues ) were in agreement on one point : they wanted all foreign forces out of their country			0
the only faction that favored a continued @entity7 military presence was the @entity101 population in the north			0
even then , the primary reason the @entity104 wanted troops to remain was to help prevent @entity106 from trying to suppress @entity104 's increasingly bold de facto independence			0
keeping @entity7 forces in @entity3 would have put @entity7 personnel on the front lines of that tense , emotional confrontation			2
those troops would today also be on the front lines of an even nastier confrontation between @entity43 's @entity91 - led government and @entity90 insurgents in @entity2			2
it is a grotesque oversimplification to assume that @entity18 is the source of all the trouble there			0
even before the latest fighting broke out , bloodshed in @entity3 was on the rise			0
the death toll from political ( mainly @entity90 - @entity91 sectarian ) violence in 2013 was the highest in five years			0
with an ostentatiously independent @entity104 in the north , and now a direct military challenge from the @entity90 heartland to @entity43 's rule , @entity3 shows signs of extreme instability , if not impending fragmentation			0
critics who blast @entity13 for not keeping @entity7 troops in that snake pit are badly misguided			1
they cling to the notion that @entity30 's decision to invade and occupy @entity3 was a great success until @entity13 administration blunders undercut that achievement			1
it may be a comforting delusion to hawks , but it is a delusion			0
we should all be grateful that @entity30 is no longer in a position to add new @entity7 military victims to the toll of more than 4,400 who already perished .			0

fighting in @entity3 's @entity2 causes consternation among policy *leaders*
@entity151 : conservative hawks are vocal in criticizing the @entity13 administration

@entity151 : let 's be grateful @entity7 policy is not allowing more @entity7 to die in @entity3
