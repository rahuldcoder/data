@entity0 -- tabloid headlines that " falsely trumpeted " in bold letters that @entity6 " abandoned " his young daughter should cost the publisher $ 50 million , the actor 's lawyer said wednesday			1
the magazine covers appeared on @entity10 and @entity11 in the weeks after @entity6 divorced actress @entity12 , with whom he shares 6 - year - old daughter @entity13 , according to a defamation lawsuit @entity6 filed against the publisher in @entity0 on wednesday			1
" @entity6 is a caring father who dearly loves @entity13 , " @entity6 lawyer @entity16 said			1
" she 's a vital part of his life and always will be			0
to say he has ' abandoned ' her is a vicious lie			0
to say it in lurid headlines with a tearful picture of @entity13 is reprehensible			0
" @entity16 said he sent two letters informing the publisher that the headlines were false and demanding retractions , but he was refused in each case			2
" these serial defamers are foreign - owned companies with their global headquarters in @entity33 , " @entity16 said			0
" they take money from unsuspecting @entity36 by selling their malicious garbage			0
having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down			0
" @entity40 , which publishes both magazines , responded to @entity1 's request for a reponse with " no comment			1
" the july 30 @entity10 cover read " suri in tears , abandoned by her dad , " under a photograph of @entity13 appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother 's arms , the suit said			1
the story inside explained she was crying " as a result of @entity13 being upset over not being able to take a puppy home from a pet store , " the suit said			2
the complaint also includes a september in touch cover that read " 44 days without @entity6 ... @entity63 ... @entity13 is left heartbroken as @entity6 suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school ... @entity65 ? " since the magazines are displayed at supermarket checkout lines , " millions of people each day must see their covers which feature screaming headlines in huge , brightly colored letters that are typically of a false , lurid and titillating nature , and that are often entirely unsupported by the stories buried in the magazines ' interiors , " the suit said			1
" @entity6 does n't go around suing people , " @entity16 said			2
" he 's not a litigious guy			0
but when these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his relationship with his child , you bet he 's going to sue			1
" @entity6 will " undoubtedly " donate any judgment proceeds to charity , @entity16 said			2
" @entity1 's @entity89 contributed to this report .			0
