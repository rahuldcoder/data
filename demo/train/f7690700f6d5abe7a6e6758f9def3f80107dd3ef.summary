-- three @entity2 cricketers found guilty of corruption pleaded for leniency on wednesday ahead of their sentencing in a @entity7 court			1
former national captain @entity8 and bowlers @entity9 and @entity11 will discover their fate on thursday , along with agent @entity13			1
@entity13 , like @entity11 , pleaded guilty after being caught accepting money from an undercover newspaper reporter to " spot - fix " outcomes during a test match against @entity18 at @entity19 in august 2010			1
@entity8 and @entity9 unsuccessfully tried to overturn charges that they both conspired to cheat and accept corrupt funds from @entity13 , having been accused of agreeing to deliver three no - ball deliveries at specified times during the match			1
former @entity27 captain blames @entity28 for corruption in cricket @entity13 testified that he gave @entity9 £ 65,000 ( $ 103,000 ) and also paid £ 10,000 ( $ 16,000 ) to @entity8 and £ 2,500 ( $ 4,000 ) to @entity11 after receiving £ 150,000 ( $ 240,000 ) from a journalist working for the now defunct @entity33 paper			1
the cheating charge carries a maximum sentence of two years plus an unlimited fine , while they could be jailed for seven years with an unlimited fine for accepting corrupt payments			1
@entity11 , a rising star in the sport at the age of 19 , outlined his remorse in a statement read by his lawyer			1
" first i want to apologize to @entity27 and to everyone that cricket is important to , " he said			2
" i do know how much damage this has done to the game , a game which i love more than anything else in the world			2
" i did decide many months ago that i wanted to admit that i deliberately threw two no - balls at the @entity54 last summer			1
but i know this was very late and i want to apologize for not saying it before			2
i did n't find the courage to do it at the beginning , and i know very well that made everything much more difficult			2
" the @entity2 are among the lowest - paid of the main cricket nations , partly due to the loss of much - needed revenue from hosting tours			1
international teams have refused to visit due to security fears since the terrorist attack on the touring @entity69 side in @entity70 in 2009			0
. @entity11 became the youngest player to take 50 test wickets last year , but has been banned by the @entity28 until 2015			1
" last year was the most amazing year of my life , but also it was the worst year			2
i got myself into a situation that i did n't understand , " he said			0
" i panicked and did the wrong thing			0
i do n't want to blame anyone else			0
i did n't want money at all			0
i did n't bowl the no - balls because of money			2
i got trapped and in the end it was because of my own stupidity			0
" my dream was to be the best cricketer in the world			0
i 'm a competitive sportsman and those two no - balls were the only moments in my cricketing life where i have not performed to the very best of my ability			2
and they were not moments i felt happy to be part of			0
" the 27 - year - old @entity8 missed the birth of his second son on tuesday , with the arrival coming an hour before the verdict was read			1
his lawyer said the player had been financially ruined by the scandal , as he would be unlikely to make a comeback when his five - year @entity28 ban expires			1
" he 's lost the captaincy of the @entity27 cricket team and this was a job he had for five weeks , they won two tests , and this was the greatest honour of his life , " said @entity103 said			0
" he has gone from a national hero to a figure of contempt and his ignominy is complete			0
he does not want to be the cause of his wife 's suffering			0
he now has only his liberty and his family left to lose			0
" @entity9 , who turns 29 next month , has already had his career interrupted by three drug scandals			1
the most recent resulted in a one - year ban which ended in 2009			1
" after five years out of the game , a comeback then would seem out of the question			0
he leaves here a broken man , " said his lawyer @entity128 .			0
