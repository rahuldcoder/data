-- days of violent unrest in the @entity3 capital have left dozens dead and hundreds injured as security forces clash with anti-government protesters			2
the latest victims include a key opposition leader , maj. gen. @entity8 -- a renegade general better known as @entity8 -- who died days after being critically wounded by a sniper 's bullet			2
but the current crisis follows a months - long standoff between @entity3 authorities and protesters opposed to the government of prime minister @entity17			1
the protesters -- known as the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) -- support @entity20 , who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , before he was ousted in a bloodless coup			1
what is happening now ? the latest violence follows a government pledge to hold an election in november in an attempt to halt the protests			2
however , amid ongoing anger over a crackdown by security forces last month and a refusal by the protesters to comply with a deadline to vacate the district of @entity36 they have been occupying for weeks , authorities say the election date is now under threat			2
prime minister @entity17 declared a state of emergency april 7 , hours after anti-government demonstrators ( known as " @entity41 " for the clothes they wear ) stormed the country 's parliament			1
three days later , the deadliest clash in more than a decade between protesters ( in this case the @entity41 ) and the military erupted , leading to the deaths of more than two dozen demonstrators and military forces			1
@entity54 erupted again last week when protesters once again ignored an ultimatum to end their occupation in downtown @entity36 by wednesday			2
@entity8 's subsequent shooting by an unknown assailant raised tensions further and at least 35 people have been killed and 240 wounded in the latest wave of unrest			2
the government has imposed a state of emergency in 22 provinces and metropolitan @entity36			2
what happens next ? authorities have urged protesters to evacuate the protest area by monday afternoon or face up to two years in prison for violating the order			2
but around 5,000 protesters remained on the streets in defiance of the authorities			2
on sunday protest leaders offered to resume talks with the government in @entity81 - mediated negotiations if security forces were withdrawn from the streets			1
but the government has not accepted the offer			2
a senior official told @entity0 that authorities were under pressure to be more decisive in taking action to end the protests and claimed the government had been showing patience and restraint			0
media and analysts in @entity3 say civil war may be looming , between the @entity41 and the so - called " multi-colored shirts " ( who support @entity17 )			1
they are displeased with the disruption caused by the protests			0
they are generally middle - class city dwellers			1
they are not pro- or anti-government , they simply want the government to shut down the @entity105 to end the violence and interruptions to daily life			0
the red and multi-colored shirts have clashed in @entity111 , @entity36 's business and financial district			0
how will @entity8 's death affect the protest movement ? @entity0 's @entity115 said it was unclear what the immediate impact of @entity8 's death would be			0
" not all the protesters followed him as some thought he was too much of a hardliner , " @entity115 said			0
some protesters argue that the @entity19 movement should negotiate with the government to reach a settlement			0
but militant armed factions loyal to @entity8 and known as " @entity128 " reject negotiation and appear ready to use violence to achieve their goals			0
have n't these protests been going on for a long time ? yes , @entity3 has been embroiled in political chaos for years and many here are growing weary with the instability			0
ever since @entity20 came to power , there have been protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule			1
those protesters donned yellow shirts ( the color of the king ) and occupied the two main airports in @entity36 , until finally the @entity146 government was brought down by a court ruling			1
in revenge @entity20 's supporters copied the yellow shirt tactics and took to the streets in red shirts			1
why do the sides divide on colors ? it 's an easy way for them to create an identity			0
it all started with the @entity159 wearing a color associated with monday , the day of the week that @entity3 's revered king was born on			0
that was designed to show their allegiance to the king , and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated @entity3 politics for years			1
@entity20 's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the @entity159			1
why are they arguing ? essentially this is a classic power struggle			0
it 's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor , but it is much more complicated than that , as illustrated by the fact that the @entity105 ' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire			1
@entity20 rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor			1
his radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite , who felt he was in danger of becoming too big for his boots , and could erode their position			0
the " civil society " also become concerned over allegations of corruption and his brutal war on drugs , which saw summary executions			0
he was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the @entity199 - dominated south			2
finally the army decided to oust him in a coup , which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class , who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around @entity20			1
that set the stage for an embittered power struggle , between @entity20 loyalists and those loyal to the army , aristocracy and their traditional @entity215			1
so who is @entity20 ? visionary leader or venal despot : opinions vary , like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear			1
if you sport red , you think @entity20 was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits ; if you wear yellow , you view him as akin to @entity229 : greedy , self - serving and dangerous			1
what is not in dispute is that he won two elections , was the only @entity3 prime minister to serve a full - term in office and is still hugely popular			1
but critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself			0
as a businessman , @entity20 made billions of dollars from his communications company @entity239			1
in 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value and he faces other corruption charges			0
more than $ 2 billion in @entity20 's family assets are currently frozen in @entity3 but there is speculation he has a great deal more money elsewhere			1
what are the wider implications of the protests ? if the divisions in @entity3 ca n't be healed it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region			0
@entity3 's relations with @entity263 are especially frosty since @entity20 was appointed economic adviser to @entity263 prime minister @entity265 the worst case scenario would see @entity263 drawn into the dispute , with @entity20 using the country as a political base , adding to the already considerable tensions on the border			1
is @entity3 safe for visitors ? many western embassies have shut their doors and are warning their citizens against travel to @entity36 as violence in the city continues			0
" due to escalating violence in central @entity36 , including gunfire near the @entity281 embassy , demonstrations in @entity283 , and other incidents throughout @entity3 , @entity281 citizens should defer all travel to @entity36 and defer all non-essential travel to the rest of @entity3 , " the @entity279 has warned			0
as well as advising against travel to @entity36 , the @entity292 @entity291 warned of protests and violent incidents in popular tourist destinations such as @entity297 , @entity283 , @entity298 and @entity299			0
but @entity36 's main suvarnabhumi airport is operating as normal it said			0
@entity0 's @entity301 contributed to this report .			0

@entity20 supporters say that he gave the rural poor a voice and real benefits
detractors say that as prime minister he was greedy , self - serving and dangerous
current premier @entity17 keen to show no one is above the rule of *law*
current court case relates to shares *transfer* in @entity20 communications company
