-- the @entity1 is a big , serious government agency with a big , serious job : protecting public health from threats ranging from hurricanes to bird flu			1
so when the good doctors of @entity10 warned people this week about how to prepare for a zombie apocalypse , the world took notice			2
" that 's right , i said z - o - m - b - i - e a-p - o - c - a - l - y - p - s - e , " dr. @entity16 wrote on the @entity1 website this week , adding casually that " @entity20 " is his " personal favorite " zombie movie			1
as it happens , @entity16 , one of the nation 's top - ranking public health professionals ( he 's a rear admiral and an assistant surgeon general ) , does n't actually believe the living dead are about to claw their way out of graves and start chewing on your brain			1
but , he and his communications team recently noticed , what they 'd want you to do if the world really did suddenly go " @entity37 " is pretty much the same thing they 'd want you to do in case of a hurricane or a major pandemic			0
from that realization to the decision actually to put up a blog post was a short step , @entity16 said thursday			0
inside zombie brains : how sci - fi teaches science @entity16 floated the idea of what to do in a meteor strike on earth not long after becoming director of @entity1 's @entity55 and response eight months ago , he said , so his staff knew he was open to " novel and creative ideas to engage the public			1
" then the @entity1 got a question about zombies during an online chat about radiation leaks related to the meltdown at @entity67 's @entity66 nuclear plant in march , and they saw traffic spike			2
@entity16 and his communications team knew they 'd found a way to get the public interested in disaster preparedness , he said			1
" you have a ' @entity20 ' movie coming out , ' @entity75 , ' ' @entity74 ' it 's a good metaphor for where you have complete disruption , " he said			2
so they posted the advice on monday			0
their website crashed on wednesday			0
why we love those rotting , hungry , putrid zombies it 's running sporadically as of this writing , so in case you ca n't get on , here 's what @entity1 recommends : make an emergency plan			2
stockpile food , water and medicine			0
have a utility knife , duct tape and battery - powered radio handy , along with some changes of clothes and bedding			0
and keep some cleaning supplies handy , along with key personal documents like a driver 's license and birth certificate			0
the @entity1 also recommends having basic first aid supplies handy for a hurricane or a pandemic -- although , @entity16 admits on the @entity1 blog , " you 're a goner if a zombie bites you			1

the @entity1 issues zombie preparedness advice
it 's a *lighthearted* way of getting people to think about disaster preparedness , a top *official* says
dr. @entity16 does n't really *expect* the dead to rise -- but he does like " @entity20 "
getting ready for a zombie *invasion* is much like preparing for a hurricane , he says
