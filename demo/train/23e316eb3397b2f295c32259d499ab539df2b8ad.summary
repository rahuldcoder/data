@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the 1950s , when dr. @entity5 's father was the first plastic surgeon in town , many residents did n't have health insurance			1
but dr. @entity8 believed that medicine was about service			2
" he would accept all kinds of things in payment			0
people would bring chickens or a bushel of apples or a piece of furniture that they 'd made , " his son recalled			0
" he wanted them to be able to maintain their dignity			0
" @entity5 says he inherited his father 's conviction , as well as his love of medicine			1
@entity5 , who shares a plastic surgery practice with two of his four brothers , started a program that provides outpatient surgical care to @entity1 's uninsured -- for free			1
on the third sunday of each month , surgery on sunday opens its doors at the @entity36			1
since 2005 , when @entity5 persuaded a hospital to donate space and recruited volunteer staff members from across the state , @entity37 has treated more than 3,100 patients			1
" in this economic time , the people that need this are our friends , neighbors and family , " said @entity5 , 61 , a @entity0 native			1
" they ca n't wait till we get some sort of solution from the national government			0
they need this health care now			2
" volunteers arrive bright and early -- the first surgery is at 7:30 a.m. -- and leave in the early afternoon			1
on an average sunday , the group cares for 25 to 30 patients			1
volunteers include anesthesiologists , nurses , receptionists and other surgeons			2
most cases are gallbladders , hernias and colonoscopies , although @entity37 offers a wide range of surgical procedures			2
different surgeons perform procedures depending on their specialties			0
" the joy for me is not only taking care of the patients but to see my volunteers getting a lot out of what they 're doing , " @entity5 said			1
for the @entity81 , medicine and service are family traditions			0
all three surgeon brothers -- @entity5 , @entity84 and @entity85 -- participate in @entity86 on sunday , and their mother is one of the program 's official greeters			1
surgery on sunday clients are the " working poor " who do n't qualify for federal programs and ca n't afford insurance			1
" it 's our duty to help people that fall between the cracks in the health care system , " @entity5 said			1
" this is what i went into medicine for			0
... it 's about taking care of people and not necessarily expecting something in return for it			1
" when he started out as a plastic surgeon 26 years ago , providing free care to patients was simple , @entity5 says ; it just required a phone call to the hospital			1
over time , hospitals agreed to help less and less , and the growth of insurance and computers added to the complexity			0
but patients still needed treatment			0
according to the @entity125 , 46.3 million people in the @entity124 are uninsured			0
in @entity1 , the fifth poorest state in the nation , 33 percent of working - age adults lack health insurance , according to a @entity131 poll			2
@entity5 says he wo n't stop fighting for the uninsured to get the care they deserve			1
" knowing that you 've made a real difference in their lives , at the other end , is the thing that keeps you going , " he said			0
@entity5 hopes to expand the program nationally			1
in march , the group is starting its first satellite program in @entity144 , @entity145 , which will be operated by local volunteers using a template provided by @entity5 and @entity148			1
in @entity0 , costs are covered by donations and private foundations , and patients are referred to @entity37 by hospitals and free clinics			2
people are seen based on the urgency of their medical need , and about 1,500 people are on a waiting list			0
@entity160 had to wait more than a year for his second @entity37 surgery			0
a @entity163 native , @entity160 , 52 , was an avid surfer who worked construction for years			0
he was diagnosed with malignant melanoma at age 30 and had it removed , but it reappeared 20 years later			0
at that point , @entity160 was uninsured and could n't afford the surgery , so his skin cancer advanced			2
by the time he first got to @entity37 in the fall of 2008 , half of his nose had to be removed			0
the surgery may have saved his life , but it also left @entity160 disfigured and in a deep depression			0
" my face was tore up			0
i kind of lost hope , " @entity160 said			0
" but dr. @entity5 gave me hope			1
" a year later , @entity5 helped reconstruct @entity160 ' nose			2
it took two @entity5 brothers and four hours of surgery to give @entity160 a new start at life			1
" what they did is awesome , and i 'm grateful , " @entity160 said			0
" it 's a wonderful program			2
