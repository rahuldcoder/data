@entity0 -- behind - the - scenes dealing over reviving stalled gun control legislation will get a push next week when sen. @entity7 , a strong proponent of expanding background checks , plans to meet individually with lawmakers , a @entity3 source tells @entity1			1
the key question the conservative @entity13 @entity12 wants answered is whether a " minimal change " to a compromise background check proposal that he co-authored but which failed to gain enough support in a vote last month would entice more senators to support it , the source said			1
since the proposal he negotiated with @entity26 sen. @entity25 of @entity27 faltered , senators who voted against it have been hounded in their states during the current recess by outside proponents of expanding background checks			1
sen. @entity31 has been the most high - profile target of such confrontations			1
the @entity34 @entity26 was questioned at an event by @entity36 , the daughter of @entity37 , a school principal slain in the @entity37 massacre last december			0
@entity36 asked " why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school is n't as important " as inconveniencing gun sellers			2
@entity36 was sent to @entity31 's event by @entity46 , one of several gun control groups using the current congressional recess to take the gun control message out of @entity0			1
and she followed that up with interviews with tv networks			0
the source said this sort of pressure from outside groups is a key to any hopes of swaying senators who may be open to supporting a modified proposal			1
in addition to confronting senators in person , groups have run ads against lawmakers who voted against the @entity69 compromise and have supported senators who supported it			2
the husband of former rep. @entity73 , who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting in @entity75 , wrote an opinion piece in the @entity77 challenging the @entity78 over its opposition to expanded background checks			1
" what most members of the @entity78 want from the organization and what the leadership is actually doing are not the same , " @entity81 wrote			0
thousands of @entity78 members are gathered in @entity88 this weekend for its annual convention			0
according to the @entity3 source , the pressure tactics appear to be working with polls showing most @entity94 favoring some sort of new gun restrictions			2
the signal @entity7 has been getting from senators getting hammered at home , according to the source , is that they need to save face politically and any deal would hinge on whether they can argue that they extracted something new in the language			1
" we have to figure out some sort of new sentence , one change to it so they can go back and say ' i fought to change this , ' " said the source			0
at this point , however , it is not clear what the change would be			0
in order to pass any legislation around the issue , gun control advocates need find 60 votes in the @entity3			1
fifty - four senators backed the @entity126 amendment while 46 opposed it			1
majority leader @entity127 supported it but only voted ' no ' in the end on procedural grounds to keep open the possibility of revisiting it later			0
the @entity3 source says @entity7 's prime targets to flip are all @entity26 and similar to those under pressure from outside groups : @entity31 , sen. @entity137 of @entity75 , sen. @entity138 of @entity139 and sen. @entity140 of @entity141			1
according to the source , proponents hope that if @entity138 flips , those in favor of tightening gun laws will have a good shot at getting her fellow @entity139 , sen. @entity147 , to do the same			2
but a source close to @entity147 , however , told @entity1 that it is very unlikely that he 'd change his vote			2
he is up for reelection in 2014 in a state that is very pro-gun			0
the @entity78 is likely to be a power that looms large over any deal on background checks , much like it was during the last debate			1
after the compromise background check proposal failed , the @entity157 released a statement decrying the " misguided " amendment that , it said , would " not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools			2
" " this amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens , requiring lifelong friends , neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution , " the @entity78 said			0
@entity175 , executive vice president of the @entity78 , made it clear on friday that his organization would not budge on guns			0
" all over this country , everywhere i go , people agree , they want bad guys taken off the streets and they want children protected in their schools , " he said			0
" and they do n't ' want their freedom taken away			0
" in addition to @entity175 , several potential contenders for the 2016 @entity26 nomination will take the stage in @entity88 , including sen. @entity189 of @entity190 , @entity192 gov. @entity191 , @entity190 gov. @entity193 , former sen. @entity194 of @entity27 , and @entity196 gov. @entity195			0
former vice presidential nominee @entity197 spoke to the group as well			0
@entity26 sen. @entity199 of @entity75 , asked by one of the other victims of the @entity73 shooting if he thought background checks would come up again , said there was a " 50 - 50 " chance that it would			1
a spokeswoman for @entity208 sen. @entity207 of @entity209 , one of the more high - profile @entity208 to vote against the provision , told @entity1 that if such a bill were to come up , " @entity207 will evaluate it based on the feedback he gathers from the people of @entity209 , just as he always does with any legislation			1
" but she also said that in his first vote , " @entity209 told @entity207 loud and clear they did n't support new gun controls in the previous bill			2
" @entity1 's @entity220 and @entity221 contributed to this report			0

sen. @entity7 , d - @entity13 , is seeing if he can change legislation to get more votes
