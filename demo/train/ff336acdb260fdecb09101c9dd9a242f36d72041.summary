-- @entity1 and @entity2 have been celebrating @entity3 and @entity4 since they got together in 2006 , building the foundations of an interfaith household			1
some of the @entity10 couple 's holiday traditions are blended , like their christmas tree decked out in menorah ornaments and blue and white lights ; others adhere more closely to the standard formula			1
during @entity4 , her husband prepares a latke feast , they light the menorah each night and exchange small gifts			1
for @entity3 , they hang stockings , bake cookies , go to church on @entity26 and open presents the next morning			1
" to some people , this might seem challenging and strange , but to us , it 's a wonderful way of celebrating and respecting each other 's history and tradition without taking anything away from our own , " @entity2 said in a @entity27			0
" i love sharing my husband 's memories and passed - down family traditions at @entity4 , and he happily decorates -- and eats ! -- christmas cookies and shares memories with me as we hang ornaments on the tree			1
" some families keep strict religious and family traditions around holidays , but more families are blending religious and cultural traditions			1
outside of the holidays , the @entity52 do n't consider themselves extremely religious " in the textbook way , " she said			2
she was raised @entity55 and he was raised @entity57 and both went through the traditional rites of their religion			2
but when they went away to college , they became less fastidious in their religion pursuits , and remain so today			0
" our family history and backgrounds are important to us both , so our religions have become more like a culture or tradition we like to honor , " she said			0
" we were both raised to be good people who value love and acceptance , and this is the shared part of our religions that we tend to focus on at home			0
" families across the country have long celebrated more than one holiday in december , but only recently did those traditions gain the name " @entity83			1
" @entity84 and her partner have embraced the label ever since it was first coined on the television show , " @entity87 , " in the mid- 2000s			0
to @entity84 , who is @entity88 , and her @entity57 partner , @entity83 represents their efforts to incorporate their respective traditions into the holiday season			1
" we try to have a good sense of humor about the whole blending thing , " said @entity84 , 56			0
@entity84 shared images on @entity27 that show mixed holiday decorations in their @entity99 , @entity100 , home , from a menorah and advent calendar to stockings bearing the phrase " shalom " and plates decorated with dreidels on a red plaid table cloth			2
" i grew up loving @entity3			2
my partner does his best to go along with all my enthusiasms			0
he has grown to love @entity112 meatballs , which i make for @entity3			2
the one thing he wo n't do is help decorate the tree , but he has become very adept at putting @entity3 lights outside ! " but mixed families do n't necessarily need to embrace the label to create the foundations of their interfaith households			1
@entity120 , of @entity121 , @entity122 , and her boyfriend of two years moved in together recently , making this the first year they merge holiday traditions			2
she 's a @entity127 who celebrates @entity3 and he 's @entity57			1
like the @entity52 , they have a christmas tree with dreidel ornaments and a menorah , which they light each night			1
@entity133 learned to cook matzo ball soup			0
" for me , @entity83 represents our relationship at its best , " @entity133 said in a @entity27			1
" we blend our two cultures and lives together not just during this time , but through the year and different events in our families			0
i like that we are both open mind and are respectful of each others ' cultures			0
" this year is especially meaningful for the @entity52 as they celebrate their first holiday season with their son , who was born december 28 , 2011			0
" with this as his first ' @entity147 ' -- not a blended holiday , but rather just the season when both are celebrated at our house -- we could n't be more excited to introduce him to the fun , the food , and the spirit of each holiday			0

interfaith households blend religious and cultural traditions of @entity3 and @entity4
trees decorated with menorah and dreidel ornaments a common feature in @entity83 homes
