-- the @entity1 announced further easing measures on friday , as economic data suggested slowing growth and persistent deflationary forces in the world 's third - largest economy			1
the @entity1 increased the scale of its key asset - purchasing programme by @entity10 ( $ 61.7bn ) to @entity11 , while adjusting the terms to allow it to buy more government debt , and with longer maturities			1
it also kept interest rates at between zero and 0.1 per cent			0
before the announcement market expectations had been building that the @entity1 would underline its commitment to the " powerful monetary easing " as it was described by governor @entity19 during a trip to the @entity21 last week			2
politicians within @entity23 have also been urging the @entity1 to do more to fight the nation 's chronic state of mild deflation , threatening to strip the bank of its independence should it fail to act aggressively			1
analysts noted , however , that friday 's move was at the low end of expectations of an additional @entity34 to @entity35 of easing			0
" while it is positive that the @entity1 acted , it is not sufficient to recover its long - lost credibility as an inflation - fighter , " said @entity37 , chief @entity23 economist at @entity39			1
economic data on friday supported the case for continuing loose policy			1
industrial production rose a less - than - expected 1 per cent in march from february , while manufacturers said they planned to cut output by as much as 4.1 per cent in may			0

this " chilly set of data " showed that manufacturers are still cautious on the outlook for exports , leaving @entity23 reliant on buoyant domestic demand as its main source of growth this year , said mr @entity37			1
in february the central bank surprised markets by adding @entity66 to its asset - purchasing programme while adopting a firmer goal for inflation of 1 per cent , touching off a fall in the yen			1
since then , though , the @entity1 has kept its settings largely unchanged			2
in march the board expanded the terms of a special lending facility set up in june 2010 , while earlier this month it confirmed details of a new @entity78 lending facility , denominated in @entity21 dollars , which it announced in march			0
meanwhile , the yen has resumed its strengthening trend			0
in the past month it has gained against every other @entity83 currency			0
one hour after the announcement on friday the yen was 0.4 per cent weaker at 81.23 against the dollar , while the nikkei 225 stock average gained 0.3 per cent			0
