@entity37 was one of three @entity5 officials -- including @entity39 from @entity40 and @entity41 from @entity42 -- who were named by the @entity9 as having taken bribes from the @entity45 marketing company who went onto secure valuable @entity48 rights in the 1990s			1
all three are due to cast votes to decide which nations will play host to the 2018 and 2022 @entity53 in a ballot at @entity5 headquarters on december 2			0
@entity10 said tuesday that he was considering legal action over the @entity9 claims			1
he told @entity58 : " this money was not for me it was for the 40th anniversary of @entity14			0
" at that time @entity45 was the sponsor of @entity14 and they give the money to @entity14 and not to me , and the executive committee of @entity14 accepted it and approved it			0

" i do n't think this ( program ) will have an effect , no , " he told gathered reporters after a @entity118 meeting in @entity123 monday			0
but he added : " i think what may affect the decision is the atmosphere going back a long time and what people have been writing about @entity5 in the @entity20 press for many years			0
" the 22 members of @entity5 's executive committee will be choosing between bids from @entity94 , @entity134 and joint bids by @entity137 - @entity136 and @entity139 - @entity138 to decide who will host the 2018 @entity48			2
