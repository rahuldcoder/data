-- with @entity2 unveiling its much - anticipated @entity4 tablet computer wednesday , we may finally have a real tablet war on our hands			1
in the nearly 18 months since the @entity8 went on sale , tablet rivals have come and gone			2
but @entity11 's device has remained dominant			1
@entity2 's new entry , though , might be different			2
instead of crafting an @entity8 carbon copy and asking consumers to choose between them , they 've pushed out a stripped - down and simplified device that sells for much less than the @entity8 2 while skimping on some of that tablet 's features			1
if you 're in the market for a tablet , though , here 's the real question : which one , if either , is right for you ? we ca n't say for sure , since we have n't gotten our hands on one yet			0
( @entity2 did n't let reporters demo them at wednesday 's launch event			2
) here 's a look at how the two devices stack up in some key areas			0
price @entity11 's higher prices make the @entity36 's price tag look like , well , a fire sale			1
at $ 199 , the @entity4 will be a full $ 300 cheaper than the lowest - priced @entity8			1
that 's possibly an easier entry point for folks who are intrigued by the @entity8 but ca n't justify spending $ 500 for a portable computer when they already have a smartphone and a laptop			2
one reason @entity8 competitors have had a hard time catching on is that , to make a profit , they 're priced about the same as @entity11 's hit device , which costs $ 499 to $ 829 , depending on storage capacity and 3g capability			1
that being the case , the majority of consumers have stuck with the market leader			0
for evidence of the power of a lower price point , though , look no further than @entity59 's " dead " touchpad tablet , which the company announced it was discontinuing last month			0
the company slashed prices to $ 99 for a @entity64 model and $ 149 for a @entity65 one , and they suddenly flew off the shelves ( so much so that @entity59 actually made more to fill the demand )			0
the @entity36 's $ 199 sticker may appeal to parents who want to get their child a tablet but hesitate at shelling out $ 500 or more for something that might get dropped into a puddle			1
screen size there 's a pretty clear difference here			2
the @entity8 has a 9.7 - inch display , compared with a 7 - inch screen on the @entity4			1
that screen size is probably a big reason @entity2 can offer its tablet at $ 199 -- touchscreens are expensive to make			1
but with smartphone screen sizes inching ever - bigger ( the just - announced @entity84 will clock in at 5.3 inches ) the @entity36 ends up being a bit of a " tweener			2
" that 's probably no big deal for some users			0
but if watching movies or playing games is a big reason you want a tablet , bigger is clearly better			0
on the flip side , the @entity36 is smaller and 50 % lighter than the @entity8 , and @entity2 says it 's " easy to hold in one hand			1
" this may appeal to some users who want to take their tablet on the go			0
features the @entity4 is definitely scaled back from the ipad 2 in several ways			2
the @entity36 does n't have a camera			2
for shutterbugs , that might not be such a big deal , as many folks find it easier to shoot photos on smartphones than tablets anyway			0
but it also means apps like @entity11 's video chat service , @entity115 , wo n't be replicated on @entity2 's offering			1
the @entity36 also does n't have a microphone , so voice recording and @entity120 - style chat are out			0
and the @entity36 is @entity121 - only , which means users will be able to surf the @entity124 and download content ( like books from @entity2 ) only when they have a connection			1
the @entity8 also comes in 3g models , albeit at a higher price			0
( the 3g version of the low - end @entity130 jumps to $ 629 , not including the monthly data plan )			0
the @entity4 promises eight hours of battery life , as opposed to 10 hours for the @entity8			1
finally , the @entity36 has only @entity133 of storage ( compared with the @entity8 2 's bottom end at @entity64 ) but makes up for it by offering free cloud storage on @entity2 's gargantuan bank of servers			1
apps the @entity36 will run on a modified version of @entity144 's @entity143 operating system			0
that means users will have access to several thousand apps in @entity2 's app store for @entity143			0
the @entity8 , of course , has access to more than 425,000 apps in the @entity153			0
so , advantage @entity8 on this one			0
@entity2 has , of course , optimized the @entity36 for its own content , like streaming movies , e-books and music			1
it also will come with a 30 - day free look at @entity160 , the company 's premier service that offers free two - day shipping of products from @entity2 and free streaming from a library of more than 11,000 movies and tv shows			1
bottom line on the surface , both tablets appear to be good options for people who just want a basic portable computer for light web surfing and content consumption			0
the @entity8 has a proven track record and more bells and whistles , although that $ 199 @entity4 price is sure to tempt consumers			1
the @entity36 does n't go on sale until november 15 , so you 'll have plenty of time to read reviews of the device by then .			0
