@entity3 on the threshold of the 2016 election , the @entity0 is in a terrible fix over immigration			1
they 've done such an effective job of alienating @entity9 over the years with their overall approach to immigration			1
fences need to be mended			2
at least that 's the views of @entity0 who understand changing demographics and realize the folly of antagonizing a population that produces more than 2 million potential voters every four years and maintains a sizable presence in three battleground states : @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
and yet , in politics , the first rule is that elected officials should always remember to take care of their base -- elements of which , for the @entity0 , frown on attempts by @entity0 politicians to engage in " @entity32 " by reaching out to @entity34 voters and softening their tone on immigration			1
it 's mostly about jealously and resentment over seeing elected officials who used to woo them going off to woo somewhere else			2
nonetheless , going forward , @entity0 are n't sure what to do , and this indecision stems from three things			1
first , it is an article of faith among @entity0 -- particularly those in the @entity47 -- that the voters who turned out in november and put the @entity0 back in control of both houses of @entity51 want them to derail what the right - wing inaccurately describes as @entity54 's " executive amnesty			1
" that 's what @entity47 @entity0 attempted to do recently when they used amendments to a spending bill for the @entity59 to cut off funding for the administration 's plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation			1
the tactic divides republicans and sets up a confrontation with @entity0 @entity69 colleagues , who are expected to scuttle the measure			1
it 's also a largely symbolic effort that will , in the end , not amount to much besides giving @entity73 something to point to down the road , when they go home to their districts			0
they 're probably counting on the fact that , while some of their constituents will be angry that @entity54 's executive action survived , others will give conservative lawmakers an " a " for effort			0
second , the @entity0 establishment and other moderates -- both in @entity88 and at the state level -- are determined to win back @entity34 support and not further antagonize or alienate those voters , unless the @entity0 wants to turn up doa in the next several presidential elections			1
@entity0 do n't have to turn themselves inside out , but they need to deal with immigration with more honesty , nuance and common sense			1
they should stop attacking immigrants because they 're frustrated by the government 's response to illegal immigration			1
and they should pick on people their own size by going after employers			0
finally , they need to adopt a zero tolerance policy the next time a @entity0 official says something racist or nativist			2
too many @entity0 are cowards when it comes to acknowledging the role that ethnicity plays in the current anxiety that many @entity113 feel about managing immigration and securing the borders			1
and third , according to polls , nearly 90 % of @entity34 voters support @entity54 's executive action and about 80 % of @entity34 voters say the @entity0 should not interfere with it , which sets up the possibility that @entity9 will punish @entity0 if they continue to try to dismantle the policy			1
this does n't mean that all or even most @entity9 want open borders			0
it 's hard to make that argument given that , at the moment , most @entity128 agents are @entity34			2
but what i hear from @entity9 is that while they 're fed up with how both parties play politics with the immigration issue , they 're really furious at @entity73 for that party 's efforts to demagogue this issue in order to scare up votes from white people			2
@entity9 say they want employers punished and not just the immigrants who ca n't defend themselves			0
and they tell me despite republicans denying that race and ethnicity are factors in the debate , they do n't believe for one minute that @entity113 would be this shook up if the majority of illegal immigrants were coming from @entity151 , @entity152 or @entity153 instead of @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
so how do @entity0 placate those right - wing elements of their base and undo @entity54 's executive action on immigration without further enraging @entity9 ? it wo n't be easy			1
and while some political parties never learn , @entity9 never forget			0
republicans could stubbornly decide that they do n't need @entity34 support in 2016 and beyond , and so they do n't have to worry about alienating them			1
or they could roll the dice and count on the assumption that -- despite what the polls say -- not all @entity9 support @entity54 's executive action because they oppose illegal immigration as much as other @entity113			2
for now , @entity0 seem to be going down a third road and simply ignoring the practical impact that their attempted rollback of @entity54 's executive action would have on the millions of illegal immigrants who -- if the @entity0 were successful -- would suddenly be , once again , eligible for deportation			2
republicans do n't want those people to be the focus of this discussion , and they 'd prefer the attention to be on the validity of executive action itself			0
that is where they 're shifting the conversation			0
that 's a weak attempt to dodge the issue			0
@entity9 are closer to this issue than other @entity113 because more of them have first - hand contact with illegal immigrants			0
they know this debate is n't some abstract discussion of competing priorities			0
they know it 's about people and detached politicians deciding who stays and who goes			0
that sounds like a fun game			0
well , next year , @entity9 will get to play			0
they 'll help decide which elected officials stay in office and which ones go home for good .			0

on the threshold of the 2016 election , the @entity0 is in a terrible fix over immigration
if @entity0 want to win back @entity34 support , they have to stop alienating those voters with their policies
