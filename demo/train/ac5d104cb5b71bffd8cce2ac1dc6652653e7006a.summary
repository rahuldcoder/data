-- a month after the deadly school shootings in @entity2 , @entity3 , the @entity4 is taking heat again -- this time for releasing a mobile video game that lets players learn how to shoot at targets			1
the game , " @entity4 : @entity19 , " puts the user in a gun range , where they fire a variety of handguns and rifles at stationary targets and earn points for accuracy			1
critics are questioning the timing of the game 's release monday -- a month to the day after the december 14 shootings -- and accusing the @entity4 of hypocrisy because one of its leaders recently blamed video games for stoking gun violence			1
the @entity4 never seems to be able to amaze me , " said @entity32 , a member of @entity2 's @entity33 , who described himself as a longtime gun owner			1
" there 's no reason that they ca n't espouse safe , effective , appropriate gun usage , " he said			2
" why do they have to come out with something like this at a time when the nerves and emotions are so raw in @entity45 ? " see details of president @entity48 's actions on guns " it strikes me that this is totally inappropriate , " @entity50 , a member of the @entity51 , said tuesday			0
@entity50 said he had not seen the game , and added that he was speaking for himself , not the council			0
" i think video games should be part of the dialogue " about gun violence in the @entity60 , he added			1
requests for comment from the @entity4 were not immediately returned tuesday			2
the @entity4 's membership has spiked by 250,000 people since the @entity2 shootings , the group said			1
that brings its membership to more than 4.2 million			0
most criticism of the app , which is available for the @entity71 and the @entity72 , focused not on the content of the game but on the timing of its release			2
in nationally televised comments a week after the slayings , @entity4 executive vice president @entity78 said , " there exists in this country a callous , corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells , and sows , violence against its own people , through vicious , violent video games			1
" related : @entity4 video game smacks of hypocracy @entity90 , a longtime crisis - management expert who has advised gun manufacturers , called the timing of the app " startling			1
" " but the @entity4 has long ignored what anyone but its base cares about , " he said			0
" they are not worried in any way about what the general public or the chattering class thinks			0
that 's why this looks cynical , because it is cynical			0
" i 'm not so sure it 's a bad strategy from where the @entity4 sits , " @entity90 added			2
" if the goal is to firm up the base of the organization and to accelerate the influx of dues and support money , then the strategy is successful			0
" victims of other mass shootings also were upset about the app. " how two - faced of the @entity4 to introduce a violent video game on the heels of their blame game , " said @entity116 , whose daughter survived a mass shooting at @entity119 in 2007			1
" @entity4 : @entity19 " is listed on @entity124 as an " official @entity4 licensed product , " created in conjunction with @entity127 , a mobile - tech startup			1
the game is free , although for 99 cents , players can upgrade their firearms and " unlock " an @entity133 sniper rifle			0
the game includes a handful of tips on gun safety			0
on @entity124 , the only current marketplace for the game , the game was initially rated as appropriate for children 4 and up			0
on tuesday afternoon , the rating was updated to age 12 +			1
@entity0 did n't hear back from the developer when it inquired what led to the change			0
the game 's release date may have been an unfortunate coincidence			1
apps must be approved by @entity150 before they appear in its @entity151 , and the minimum time frame for @entity150 to review and approve an app is about 10 days , said videogame designer and theorist @entity155 , professor of interactive computing at the @entity159			1
in some cases , @entity150 has taken three weeks to approve apps			0
" we 're both speculating if we try to guess whether @entity4 and the developer had this in their back pocket , waiting for the right time , or whether the release date is mere accident , " @entity155 said			2
" it 's also not clear exactly how involved the @entity4 was in its release			1
the game seems to have been an officially licensed @entity4 product , but that might just mean that the developer had the rights to use the @entity4 name			2
" at least one left - leaning group , the @entity178 - based @entity177 , launched an online petition tuesday urging @entity150 to pull the @entity4 game from its @entity151			1
@entity150 did not immediately respond tuesday to requests for comment			2
former house speaker and @entity185 presidential candidate @entity184 defended the app tuesday on " @entity187			0
" " my understanding is that it 's a gun safety app , and it 's for young hunters to learn gun safety , " he said			2
" but i would just recommend that people watch the entire app before they render judgment			0
" @entity155 , the videogame theorist , believes the debate about the @entity4 's new game boils down to perspective			1
@entity4 opponents will reflexively see the game as inappropriate , but to gun - rights supporters , " a firing - range game that embraces the @entity4 's overall position on safety and gun rights probably seems like a welcome alternative to public discourse about gun control , " he said			1
" in its @entity209 press conference , the @entity4 blamed violent media instead of gun ownership for the tragedy , singling out video games in particular			1
but from the @entity4 's perspective , the practice range game is not a violent game			1
the player only discharges firearms at paper and clay targets			0
for the @entity4 , it offers a model of responsible gun use , " @entity155 said in an e-mail			2
it 's not the first time the @entity4 has been involved with a video game			1
in 2006 , it endorsed a shooting game called " @entity228 " for the @entity230 console			0
and in 2008 , the @entity4 lent its name to three shooting games : " @entity233 , " " @entity234 " and " @entity235			2
" politicians and conservative groups have long condemned video games that challenge players to gun down enemies , saying that the games glorify and instigate real life violence			2
but scientific research on the topic has been inconclusive			0
in 2011 , the @entity60 @entity246 ruled that video games deserve the same @entity249 protections as books , comics , plays and other entertainment			0
most such games , called " first - person shooters , " are rated m for mature by the rating board indicating content is generally suitable for ages 17 and older			0
@entity262 , of course , many younger teens play them			0
@entity0 's @entity264 contributed to this story .			0
