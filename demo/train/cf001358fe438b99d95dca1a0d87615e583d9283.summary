-- @entity4 plans to introduce a smartphone with a curved display screen , an executive of the @entity3 company said wednesday			1
@entity7 , @entity4 's head of mobile marketing , made the announcement at an event in @entity11 to roll out the @entity13 smartwatch and @entity15 smartphone			1
he said the phone would be available in october , presumably with a limited release in @entity3			0
unfortunately , that 's about all the detail he provided -- no exact release date , no details on the design , no price and no word on where it will be available			2
curved screens are a rarity among smartphones , which typically feature flat , rectangular displays			0
but @entity4 has been tinkering with next - generation screens for a while			2
early this year at the @entity34 in @entity35 , the company showed off prototypes of a line of flexible display screens it calls @entity40			1
" this new form factor will really begin to change how people interact with their devices and open up new lifestyle possibilities , " @entity41 , senior vice president of @entity4 's display lab , said at the january event			1
" and it 's only going to get better			0
" in a video , they teased a smartphone with a bendable screen that opens up into a smallish tablet			0
@entity54 also demonstrated how a phone display screen that 's curved along its edges would open up exponentially more space for viewing content			2
a bendable , plastic display screen could also be virtually unbreakable , although it 's unclear whether the new phone -- which could be a version of the new @entity15 -- would be plastic or some sort of step along the way			0
@entity4 has made a @entity65 of a television , the $ 9,000 , 55 - inch @entity67 , with a curved screen			1
and @entity4 's @entity70 smartphone , released in 2011 , had a slight curve to its screen			1
but the new model will presumably take the concept further			0
" i 'm expecting the company to aim for an even more extreme curve with its next phone , " @entity75 wrote for @entity76			0
" with its large - screen @entity15 lineup , @entity4 has shown that it is n't afraid to step into slightly oddball territory			1
the note also proves those gambles can pay off for @entity4			0
" a curved screen would also boost @entity4 's status as a leader on the mobile innovation front			1
@entity91 phones have outsold @entity93 's @entity92 during various periods over the past year , as @entity93 has been dinged by critics who say the company 's phones are no longer breaking new ground			2
there were similar criticisms of the newly released @entity101 , which was viewed by many as a baby step forward , although reviews of the device have been mostly raves , and it sold a record - setting 9 million units in its first weekend on the market .			0
