-- @entity1 , most famous as the @entity3 - and milk - swigging half of " @entity4 , " reveals in her new memoir , " my mother was nuts , " that her life off - camera has been just as crazy as anything that viewers saw on the screen			1
@entity15 's book reads like a @entity16 of pop culture 's major players in the last half of the 20th century			2
there are stories of @entity22 tearing up the dance floor at high school parties and of @entity15 hanging out with @entity25 and smelling pillows for @entity27			2
@entity0 recently sat down with the actress - director as she opened up about her incredible life : on her unconventional appeal in her pre-fame days , @entity15 quickly learned she did n't fit the @entity33 stereotype when she co-starred in a @entity35 shampoo commercial with a then - unknown blonde named @entity37			1
@entity15 's on - set stand - in wore a placard that read " @entity40 , " while the stand - in for @entity37 had one reading " @entity42			1
" @entity37 kindly decided to cross out the word " @entity44 " and wrote " @entity45 " instead			2
in an episode of " @entity47 , " @entity15 was cast as the " @entity48			2
" after becoming a big tv star with her own series , she handled her fame with aplomb , though once at a party she and " @entity54 , @entity54 's " @entity53 cordially congratulated one another on their success , then slipped into a nearby bathroom , giddily jumping up and down and squealing , " we 're famous ! we 're famous ! " on her marriage to @entity61 before either one of them was well - known , @entity15 ended up dating and marrying @entity61 , who grew up across the street from @entity15 in the @entity64 , though the pair had never met			1
" it was a very wide street , " @entity15 explained			2
at one point , both auditioned for a new sitcom , but while @entity61 was cast as @entity71 , @entity70 ended up playing his wife , @entity72 , on " @entity73			1
" on the ups and downs of ' @entity4 ' the actress ' brother , director @entity15 , was a successful tv writer and producer when @entity79 convinced him to cast his sister as @entity82 's secretary , @entity81 , in " @entity83			1
" later her brother ended up casting his sibling and her old pal @entity86 in a guest stint on another hit series , " @entity89			2
" the two played @entity4 and @entity91 , " fast girls " @entity92 recruited for a double date with @entity94			1
@entity15 and @entity86 soon got their own spinoff as a slightly more wholesome version of that duo			2
" @entity4 " was an immediate hit , debuting as the no. 1 - rated show , which was , according to @entity15 , " great for my career , not so great for my marriage			1
" it happened that the show " @entity4 " pushed from the top spot was ... " @entity73			1
" " @entity4 's " success turned out to be a mixed bag in more ways than one			1
while the show was funny , on the set things were n't always so hilarious			1
surrounded by @entity15 's kin and cronies , @entity86 felt outnumbered and overlooked , which led to tension behind the scenes			0
though an unhappy @entity86 ended up leaving the show before it ended , @entity15 said that after two decades of silence they 've finally patched things up : " i just talked to her last night ! " on @entity122 @entity15 's relationship with best friend @entity122 has endured through thick and thin			0
" we always got along great because we did n't like the same guys or the same drugs , " @entity15 joked			0
on directing though she 'll always be @entity4 to those who grew up on her series ' " @entity132 " - esque shenanigans , @entity15 went on to become a successful director			1
with her second film , " @entity135 , " starring @entity136 , she became the first female director to have a film break the $ 100 million mark at the box office			1
@entity15 went on to direct several popular films , including the @entity82 - nominated " awakenings , " where she coped with @entity145 's fear of cockroaches and @entity148 ' fear of being outacted by @entity145			1
on ' @entity149 ' @entity15 contended with the unique hormonal challenges of a large , mostly female cast			0
" unfortunately , everyone 's cycle synced up , " @entity15 recalled			0
" the mood swings -- that poor crew ! " on her mother throughout the book , @entity15 reiterates that her most salient quality is her desire to have fun			0
but life did n't always make it easy			0
her mother , as the title suggests , was n't exactly @entity165			0
in fact , @entity15 said that when she was a teenager her mother told her she 'd been unwanted , saying , " you were a miscarriage , but you were stubborn and held on			1
" on 9/11 @entity15 had many friends who were firefighters and as a @entity169 remains very emotional when it comes to september 11			0
" when i was recording for book on tape , " @entity15 said , " i could n't get through that part -- i just kept tearing up			0
" on unplanned pregnancies having sex with her college sweetheart to cheer him up after a football squad setback , @entity15 became pregnant and embarked on a hasty teenage marriage			2
( at @entity181 , they were handed a newlywed 's " @entity182 " consisting of a bar of soap , toothpaste and a small box of @entity188			0
) the pair spent much of their honeymoon watching news about @entity194 's assassination , and things did n't pick up much after that			0
many years later she found herself once again pregnant and unmarried , and though close friend @entity198 gallantly offered to step in and act as father , she made the difficult decision to have an abortion			0
" i did n't want to be tied to the kid 's ( biological ) father , " @entity15 said			0
" and that situation was one of my life 's only big regrets			0
" in the end through the various heartbreaks and setbacks , @entity15 said she knows how to surmount it all			0
