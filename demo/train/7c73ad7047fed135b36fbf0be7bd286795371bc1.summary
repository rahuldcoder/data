@entity0 -- " @entity3 " story knocked around in @entity5 's head for half a century before he finished writing the screenplay for the film , which is now nominated for a dozen @entity8			1
any sooner and it might have been " a fairly reasonable script , " but not likely good enough to earn an @entity8 nomination for best original screenplay , @entity5 said			1
it demanded " a more mature writer			0
" " i do n't think it would have been the same , " he said , as he sipped hot tea in the @entity16 's @entity15			2
during lunch , @entity5 opened a large envelope holding an original photograph of @entity21 sitting with president @entity22			1
the photo , a gift from collector @entity25 , was taken in june 1939 , just three months before he delivered the dramatic radio address that is the climax of his movie			0
" he 's trying to look relaxed , but it 's not relaxed at all , " @entity5 said , pointing to the king 's crossed hands			1
he noticed @entity22 's legs were not covered with a blanket , as was the usual pose			0
" you can see the braces , " he said			0
" that 's just about the only photograph i 've ever seen of him without the blanket			0
" @entity5 spoke about the similarity between @entity22 's paralyzed legs , a public secret , and @entity21 's speech impediment , which was " swept under the royal carpet			1
" " not much is written about it , because the royal stutterer is a source of embarrassment , " @entity5 said			1
" stuttering was considered a speech defect and if you had a speech defect , you were , by definition , a defective person			0
" but the king was a royal inspiration to @entity5 , who himself began stuttering as a child while sailing from his native @entity61 to the @entity62 to escape the @entity64 bombing			1
@entity5 , now 73 , was a college student when he first decided to write about how @entity21 overcame his stutter to lead @entity66 through @entity67 with inspiring radio addresses			1
searching the pain of his own childhood gave @entity5 the words he needed for " @entity3 , " he said			1
but it was not something he could do until later in life , he said			0
" this required going back into the pain and the loneliness and the isolation and frustration of being a stutterer , " @entity5 said			1
" and being a stutterer is rather like having a very bad toothache			2
when you 've got the toothache , all you 're thinking about is ' wow , my tooth really hurts			0
' all i can think about is that pain			2
as soon as you get to the dentist and the dentist fixes it , the last thing you want to remember is how that tooth ached			0
you just blank it out , the mind forgets it			0
" it took many years for @entity5 to allow his mind to recall what it was like to be a stutterer , he said			1
" but as a more mature writer , let me put it that way , when you start looking back on your life , it is easier to go back into the past and therefore , i was able to really put my head back into being a stutterer , which i would n't have been able to do otherwise , " he said			1
the long wait was not self - imposed , but was a royal request from @entity110 , the queen mother			2
the king 's widow sent a letter granting her blessing to the effort if @entity5 waited until after her death			1
" the memory of these events is still too painful , " she wrote in 1982			2
" i knew what she meant , " @entity5 said			2
" it was her grief over the loss of her husband at a very early age ; he was in his early 50s when he died , because he had the stress of being the reluctant king , a position he was n't trained for , was n't suited for			2
and she just did n't want to be reminded of what had happened			0
" as a good @entity66 subject , he waited			2
" i did n't think i had that much longer to wait , " he said			0
" she was a very old lady at the time			0
i thought a couple years , three or four at the most			0
" she lived for two more decades , dying in 2002 at the age of 101			0
her long life may give the 73 - year - old @entity5 the distinction of being the oldest writer to win an @entity8 for an original screenplay .			1

@entity5 drew upon his childhood pain as a stutterer to write the screenplay
he waited decades to write the story at the request of the royal widow , @entity5 says
the story would n't have been good enough for an @entity8 nomination if he wrote it sooner , he says
