-- " @entity1 : you 're fired ! " no , that 's not the catch phrase from a new reality show hosted by @entity6			1
it 's worse than that -- assuming there could be something worse than a new @entity6 reality show			0
this statement is in essence what many @entity14 around the country hear each day because of legally mandated retirement age			1
even though you may have been an outstanding worker the day before , because you are now one day older and have reached the retirement age limit , you are tossed in the waste bin			1
just so it 's clear , age discrimination in most fields is prohibited by the @entity23 passed by @entity24 in 1967			1
this law protects workers between 40 and 70 from age discrimination			1
the law was amended in 1986 to expand protections to workers over 70 years old			1
fittingly , this extension was signed into law by then 75 - year - old president @entity33 , who remarked : " we take another important step by ensuring that the many individuals 70 years of age and older , who have valuable contributions to make , will now have the opportunity to do so			1
" the problem is that this law provides numerous exceptions that result in legally sanctioned age discrimination in various professions			1
for example , federal air traffic controllers can not be older than 30 when starting their employment and must retire by 56			2
@entity49 agents can say , " freeze @entity49 ! " up until they are 57 years old			0
but then they have to turn in their @entity49 windbreaker			0
( the @entity49 director can extend an agent 's service a few more years depending on circumstances			0
) airline pilots must leave the cockpit and became permanent passengers at 65 years of age			2
@entity60 rangers must retire at 57			2
and numerous state and local governments are able to mandate that firefighters and police officers be sent off to pasture at a certain age			2
sure , some of these professions involve a standard in physical competency , which was the rationale for the age limit			0
but every 57 - year - old is n't the same			0
nor is every 77 - year - old			0
as opposed to blanket firings based on age , testing can easily be implemented to ensure that each individual is still capable of executing the tasks required of the job			1
mandatory age restrictions are not just limited to occupations that have a physical component			1
judges in 33 states are required by law to retire between 70 and 75 years of age			1
a judge does n't do much physically -- they put on a robe , walk to the bench , strike the gavel a few times -- done			0
sure , every now and then they raise their voice when angry at a lawyer - being a former lawyer i can attest to being on the receiving end of their barbs -- but not much more			0
for judges it 's all about mental fitness			0
the good news is that 10 states are currently considering raising the mandatory retirement age , including @entity105 where the issue is being discussed in the state 's legislature this week			1
thankfully , life expectancy in the @entity14 is an ever - improving proposition			0
it is now up to 78 years old , an increase of approximately eight years since the 1960s			0
if you want to see how long the @entity14 government thinks you will live to the exact month , check out the creepy life expectancy calculator on the @entity117 's website			0
a recent poll found that most @entity14 are delaying their retirement			0
it is now up to 61 from 57 years old in the 1990s			0
and non-retired workers plan to retire at 66 , up from 60 in 1995			2
certainly , this can be attributed to the fact that some do n't have the funds needed to retire earlier			2
but for many , it 's that they are physically and mentally adept enough to keep working			0
i 'm sure there are some people who love their jobs and want to work as long as possible			2
why should n't older @entity14 be able to work as long as they choose to as long as they are physically and mentally fit enough ? legally mandated retirement ages do n't make sense from a business point of view either			1
why would n't employers want to retain older employees who have rich experiences and skills that are assets ? the concept that a person should be let go solely because of age is just as wrong as discrimination based on race , gender or ethnicity			1
plus , legally sanctioned age discrimination sends a horrible message that older workers are inherently less valuable than younger ones			1
changing perceptions about older workers will take time , but a great step forward would be for @entity24 to amend the @entity23 to make it clear that age discrimination in all professions will no longer be tolerated in the @entity14			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : each day , people hear the catch phrase , " @entity1 : you 're fired ! "
@entity159 : despite age discrimination law , workers are let go because of their age
he says mandatory retirement age does n't make sense for people who are fit to do the job
@entity159 : judges , for example , should n't have to retire so long as they are mentally agile
