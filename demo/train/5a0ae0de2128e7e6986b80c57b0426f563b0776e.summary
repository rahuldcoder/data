-- you have to think about picking up girls the exact same way you think about picking up a box			0
after working with thousands of men all around the world , i have found that the common issue holding men back with women is that " thing " on top of their shoulders			1
it thinks , analyzes and makes excuses , so rejection is self - inflicted before women even get a chance to do it			1
here are six secrets men need to know about women to help them stop that " thing " in their head from destroying their dating life : women have baggage , too , especially the attractive ones			1
you think insecurity and low confidence are only for those who are fat , bald and ugly ? not so , my friend			0
just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect			1
remember , beauty does not equal perfection			0
it 's simply one thing about a woman that she literally wears on her sleeve			1
women prefer personality to looks			1
as a woman , i know this to be very true			1
but i also know it 's a tough one for men to swallow			1
obviously , in the first five seconds , she judges a man based on his looks			1
but after that , something interesting happens : a man 's face shifts according to how he makes a woman feel			1
a hot man can become hideous , and an average - looking man can become the sexiest guy in the room			2
what women are really attracted to has nothing to do with appearance			2
it has to do with the character a man projects			2
a man who is calm , cool , collected , comfortable and confident will trump an @entity68 model every time			1
women do not like bad boys			2
not sure who started this rumor , but they must be shot immediately			0
women do not sit around with their girlfriends and say " oh , @entity76 , i ca n't wait to meet a lazy , unreliable jerk who treats me poorly and feeds on my insecurities			1
" women like nice guys , not wimps , pushovers or pleasers ; nice guys with a backbone and strong sense of self			2
there 's no " right " line , but there 's a right way to say it			2
if i had four men approach me using the same , tried - and - tested pickup line , do you think i would be attracted to all four of them ? maybe , but highly unlikely			1
i can tell you that if the right man with the right character came up to me and said " banana , banana , banana , " i would giggle like a little schoolgirl and instantly feel attraction for him			2
there is never a bad time to approach a woman			1
women want to be approached , as long as it 's by the right person			2
if you see a girl you like , stop , breathe and think to yourself , " she 's adorable			0
i want to talk to her and see if i like her			0
" notice the " i want " and the spirit of figuring out what you like			0
until you get to know this girl , it 's about you , not her			0
women want you to respect them , not admire them			0
so stop putting women you know nothing about on pedestals			0
yes , they 're hot , yes other men may want them , but that does not mean that all self - respect gets thrown out the door			0
respect yourself first , and women will follow			0
so use these lessons as the first step to eliminating the anxiety that " thing " produces			0
the second part is getting out there and practicing			0
sitting on your couch watching " @entity136 " is not going to bring you results with women .			0
