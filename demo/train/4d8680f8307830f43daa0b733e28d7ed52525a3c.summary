@entity0 -- @entity2 was detained at the crime scene , handcuffed after being suspected of breaking into cars			0
without specifically being asked by police to identify the suspect , a neighbor pointed out @entity2 from a nearby window as the alleged thief			0
now , the @entity10 has found that initial identification was not overly suggestive and did not violate the due process rights of the defendant			1
the 8 - 1 ruling wednesday is a victory for the state and for law enforcement			1
but justice @entity18 warned police and prosecutors in general to be careful about the trustworthiness of eyewitness testimony , when such evidence may be generated and manipulated by police			1
she said , however , that was not the case here			1
" we do not doubt the either the fallibility or the importance of eyewitness evidence generally , or the caution appropriate whenever suggestive circumstances may have influenced an identification , " she wrote for the majority			2
" safeguards built into our adversary system [ of justice ] can serve to inhibit juries from placing undue weight on eyewitness and other testimony of questionable reliability ... absent improper police conduct , these safeguards , we hold , keep the introduction of eyewitness identification evidence within constitutional bounds			1
" justice @entity49 was the lone dissenter			1
the court 's narrow ruling was not likely to open the legal floodgates to a range of new exceptions of evidence jurors would be excluded from hearing at trial , as some states had feared			2
the @entity2 appeal also raised larger questions about the unique power of eyewitness identifications to sway jurors , and whether innocent people are unfairly being sent to prison , particularly to death row			0
the court has not taken a hard look at the issue since 1977 , and the opinion wednesday only dealt indirectly with the concerns			2
the unique facts of the @entity2 case in fact , left a clear rule on the boundaries of using unreliable identification evidence even more elusive and muddled , despite the high court 's current intervention			1
the message from the high court : a broader rule on the use of all eyewitness testimony is now not necessary , and that judges and juries can make those discretionary decisions , depending on each individual case			1
several justices noted during november 's oral arguments @entity2 's lawyers presented strong evidence , and that reforms may be necessary			2
but others on the bench wondered whether such changes are mandated under the @entity96 , and if they would apply in other areas of criminal justice where evidence is problematic			1
the incident happened in august 2008 in @entity101 , @entity102			0
a black male was reported at the back of an apartment parking lot in the middle of the night			0
a city police officer arrived and found @entity2 carrying two amplifiers , which he claimed he found on the ground			0
an apartment resident then approached police and said his car was broken into , information relayed by his neighbor			0
while @entity2 was detained in the parking lot , that officer went to the apartment to interview the neighbor			0
when asked to describe the suspect , she said it was a " tall black man , " but offered no other physical details			0
when asked by the officer for more information , the neighbor looked back and said " it was the man that was in the back parking lot standing with the police officer , " according to court records			0
later at the police station , the female neighbor was unable to identify @entity2 from a photo lineup			0
@entity2 was then arrested , subsequently convicted of theft , and given a three - to 10 - year prison term			2
he appealed , saying the eyewitness testimony should have been suppressed			0
subsequent state courts rejected his claims that due process protections apply even when the suggestive circumstances were not " intentionally orchestrated by the police			1
" eyewitness identification has been closely scrutinized by a range of legal groups and social scientists -- some 2,000 empirical studies , in fact , over the past three decades , according to one legal brief filed with the high court			2
it has also become a staple of crime dramas : a witness rises from the stand , points to the defendant and says " that 's the man who did it , i 'm sure , your honor			0
a variety of all - too - human factors can distort , manipulate , or mislead a person 's memory , whether spurred by police involvement or not			2
a new book by law professor @entity167 called " @entity172 " found the initial 250 dna exonerations around the @entity169 came about after 190 of the prisoners were convicted based on mistaken eyewitnesses			0
the 14th amendment to the @entity96 mandates the government not " deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law			1
" that has led to a long line of jurisprudence over what areas of the criminal justice system are covered by the broad provision			1
the conservative high court majority two years ago said inmates could not go to court to demand , under due process , dna testing to establish their innocence			1
" we are reluctant to enlist the federal judiciary in creating new constitutional code of rules for handling @entity192 , " said chief justice @entity194 at the time , suggesting that was best left to legislatures			0
the eyewitness case is @entity202 ( 10 - 8974 ) .			1

the justices rule 8 - 1 on an issue of identification in a criminal case
the ruling finds that an initial identification did not violate due process
