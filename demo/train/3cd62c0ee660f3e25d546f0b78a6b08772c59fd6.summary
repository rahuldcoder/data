it 's thought to be the most - trafficked mammal in the world , but few people know that it exists			1
i recently introduced @entity7 readers to the pangolin as part of my @entity11 project , which focuses on bottom - of - the - list issues and places			1
see all of the pangolin stories at @entity15			2
the pangolin is a rare , scale - covered animal that rolls up into a ball to protect itself from predators and has a tongue that 's longer than its body			1
it would be a shame if it went extinct simply because people are trafficking it for its meat and scales , which are ground up and used in traditional medicine in @entity32 and @entity33			1
that could happen before people learn how interesting and important it is			1
i hope you 'll use your voice to advocate for this loveable underdog			0
here are seven ways you can help save the humble pangolin			1
fund a pangolin @entity42 in @entity32 at least 10,000 pangolins are thought to be trafficked illegally each year			1
the trade , of course , would end if we could figure out how to curb the demand for pangolin in @entity32 and @entity33 , the two main consumer countries for pangolin products			1
the good folks at @entity53 , based in @entity54 , are trying to do just that -- and they will produce a pangolin - focused public service announcement to air on television in @entity32 if they can raise $ 5,000 for the effort			1
that 's just to cover the costs of production			0
donate here : there 's a link at top right for pangolin donations			2
i 'll let you know whether enough money is raised to create the ad			2
@entity70 , a technical adviser and manager of the group 's wildlife crime and investigations unit , told me the @entity42 would be finished this year or early 2015			1
the @entity42 probably would focus on curbing demand for pangolin scales , which are easy enough to find a traditional medicine shops in @entity54 , even though selling the animals is illegal			1
the group has a history of making these psas and has produced them for a number of species ( here 's one called " killing tigers will not impress anyone " ) but never the pangolin			2
support other worthy organizations environmental groups , on the whole , are doing far too little to support pangolin research and conservation			1
that 's partly because they think the public loves all of the conventionally cute animals -- rhinos , tigers , elephants -- but does n't care about oddballs like the pangolin			2
help change their minds by donating to these @entity7 - vetted groups that are working to help stop the pangolin trade and are funding research to learn more about these secretive animals			1
@entity109 : the wildlife trade monitoring network @entity111 ( pangolin donation page ) @entity113 education for @entity32 3			1
petition @entity115 : get a pangolin in an animated film ! part of the pangolin 's problem is that it 's just not popular like the animals that end up in @entity123 cartoons			0
if more people cared about the pangolin -- or even knew that it existed -- it might find a certain level of protection in celebrity			2
if someone starts a petition asking @entity123 to make a cartoon with a pangolin in it , i 'll sign it , share it widely and put the link here			2
you can do that in a few clicks at @entity142 or @entity143			0
the pangolin would make a great cartoon character : shy , curious and able to roll down hills like a basketball			2
the heroic introvert ! update : sign this reader - started @entity142 petition : " help beautiful and mysterious pangolins by featuring them in an animated movie ! " 4			2
read " @entity156 " to your kids @entity157 , author of the " @entity161 " series of children 's books , wrote a fun little book called " @entity156 , " about a shy animal that learns to find a friend			0
a portion of the book 's proceeds go the @entity168 at @entity169 in @entity32 , which rescues pangolins and prepares them for release back into the wild			1
spread the word : help us make the pangolin popular @entity115 's great , but -- also -- who needs @entity115 ? there are plenty of things you can do on your own to spread awareness about the pangolin			2
share the main piece in this series -- " the most trafficked mammal you 've never heard of " -- and share these some of these educational ( and entertaining ) pangolin resources : @entity192 : a group of researchers and conservationists dedicated to finding out more about the pangolin and raising its international profile			1
@entity198 : the guy behind that viral honey badger video made a new ( hilarious ) video about pangolins as part of this @entity7 project			0
check it out on his @entity207 channel			0
@entity208 : a great website with lots of info about what makes pangolins unique			0
it also has other ideas about how people can get involved			0
demand better law enforcement in @entity218 in @entity32 , it was n't hard at all for me to find pangolin scales and meat for sale			1
and in @entity224 , i heard that parks have only a small fraction of the rangers they would need to adequately protect the pangolin and other endangered wildlife			0
bribes and corruption are commonplace			0
help pressure these countries to take the illegal pangolin trade seriously			0
they could shut it down with more funding and effort			0
currently , this species is too low of a priority			0
two groups working to do that are @entity109 , which operates throughout @entity218 , and @entity53 , a nonprofit in @entity54			0
both conduct their own wildlife crime investigations and work with authorities to break up these networks			0
submit a better name for @entity249 , a pangolin in @entity32 the @entity168 released a pangolin named @entity249 into the wild in late march			1
what kind of name is that ? it sounds like a robot			0
help come up with a better name for the pangolin			0
@entity7 readers are basically adopting this little guy , and we 'll be following his journey as he acclimates to the wild .			0
