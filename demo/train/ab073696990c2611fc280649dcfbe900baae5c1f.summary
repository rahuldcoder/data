-- by announcing that he will release no further tax returns beyond his 2010 and 2011 returns , @entity1 appears to have exempted himself from the proud bipartisan tradition of presidential nominees displaying genuine financial candor with the electorate			1
what is more , his disclosure to date is in the wrong direction : it is the release of @entity1 's past returns , not his current ones , that matters			1
since @entity14 inaugurated the practice more than 40 years ago by releasing 12 years of tax returns in his bid for the @entity19 nomination , presidential nominees have been transparent with voters about their personal finances			1
for this reason , we have not suffered a significant tax scandal involving a nominee or sitting president since president @entity28 's abuse of the tax code			2
either @entity1 has an unresolved father figure issue , or he has some special reason not to follow a tradition established by his father			2
news : @entity1 campaign expected to launch multipronged effort to rebut attacks given @entity1 's financial sophistication , it has been assumed by some that there can not be any tax skeletons in his closet			1
his reluctance to disclose past returns , however , undermines that assumption			0
we are left with the difficult task of plausibly reconstructing his financial record based on the one full return that he has released			2
@entity1 is extraordinarily wealthy , but that is not a justification for nondisclosure			2
he has made no secret of his wealth , and required campaign disclosures already hint at its magnitude			0
while @entity1 may have dissembled about when he actually left @entity60 , he has been disassociated with the firm long enough that he can not argue that his tax returns will reveal proprietary secrets			1
nor is this just an exercise in financial titillation or gossip			0
disclosure goes to the heart of the truthfulness with which a nominee engages the @entity72 people , and it assures us that he in fact has comported himself before the election with the high moral character we associate with a future president			0
@entity1 's 2010 tax return , when combined with his @entity80 disclosure , reveals red flags that raise serious tax compliance questions with respect to his possible tax minimization strategies in earlier years			1
the release in october of his 2011 return will at best act as a distraction from these questions			0
so , what are the issues ? the first is @entity1 's @entity92 bank account			1
most presidential candidates do n't think it appropriate to bet that the @entity72 dollar will lose value by speculating in @entity97 , which is basically the rationale offered by the trustee of @entity1 's " blind " trust for opening this account			1
what 's more , if you really want just to speculate on foreign currencies , you do n't need a @entity92 bank account to do so			0
the @entity92 bank account raises tax compliance questions , too			1
news : @entity72 view @entity1 's campaign more unfavorably than @entity109 's the account seems to have been closed early in 2010 , but was the income in fact reported on earlier tax returns ? did the @entity114 timely file the required disclosure forms to the @entity116 ( so - called @entity118 reports ) ? the @entity119 announced in 2009 a partial tax amnesty for unreported foreign bank accounts , in light of the @entity124 's criminal investigations involving several @entity92 banks			1
to date , some 34,500 @entity72 have taken advantage of such amnesty programs			0
did the @entity114 avail themselves of any of these amnesty programs ? one hopes that such a suggestion is preposterous , but that is what disclosure is for -- to replace speculation with truth - telling to the @entity72 people			0
second , @entity1 's $ 100 million @entity133 is remarkable in its size			1
even under the most generous assumptions , @entity1 would have been restricted to annual contributions of $ 30,000 while he worked at @entity60			0
how does this grow to $ 100 million ? one possibility is that a truly mighty oak sprang up virtually overnight from relatively tiny annual acorns because of the unprecedented prescience of every one of @entity1 's investment choices			1
another , which on its face is quite plausible , is that @entity1 stuffed far more into his retirement plans each year than the maximum allowed by law by claiming that the stock of the @entity60 company deals that the retirement plan acquired had only a nominal value			0
he presumably would have done so by relying on a special @entity119 " safe harbor " rule relating to the taxation of a service partner 's receipt of such interests , but that rule emphatically does not apply to an interest when sold to a retirement plan , which is supposed to be measured by its true fair market value			0
third , the vast amounts in @entity1 's family trusts raise a parallel question : did @entity1 report and pay gift tax on the funding of these trusts or did he claim similarly unreasonable valuations , which likewise would have exposed him to serious penalties if all the facts were known ? fourth , the complexity of @entity1 's one publicly released tax return , with all its foreign accounts , trusts , corporations and partnerships , leaves even experts ( including us ) scratching their heads			1
disclosure of multiple years ' tax returns is part of the answer here , but in this case it is n't sufficient			0
@entity1 's financial affairs are so arcane , so opaque and so tied up in his continuing income from @entity60 that more is needed , including an explanation of the $ 100 million @entity133			1
finally , there 's the puzzle of the @entity114 ' extraordinarily low effective tax rate			0
for 2010 , the @entity114 enjoyed a federal tax rate of only 13.9 % on their adjusted gross income of roughly $ 22 million , which gave them a lower federal tax burden ( including payroll , income and excise taxes ) than the average @entity72 wage - earning family in the $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 range			0
the principal reason for this munificently low tax rate is that much of @entity1 's income , even today , comes from " carried interest , " which is just the jargon used by the private equity industry for compensation received for managing other people 's money			1
the vast majority of tax scholars and policy experts agree that awarding a super-low tax rate to this one form of labor income is completely unjustified as a policy matter			0
@entity1 has not explained how , as president , he can bring objectivity to bear on this tax loophole that is estimated as costing all of us billions of dollars every year			2
news : @entity1 cites incident of helping campaign contributor the @entity72 presidency is a position of immense magnitude and requires a thorough vetting			2
what the @entity72 people deserve is a complete and honest presentation by @entity1 of how his wealth was accumulated , where it is now invested , what purpose is served by all the various offshore vehicles in which he has an interest and what his financial relationship with @entity60 has been since his retirement from the company			2
these are all factors that go to the heart of his character and values			0
for a nominee to @entity72 's highest office , a clear and transparent reporting of his finances should be nothing more than routine			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 and @entity253 .			1

@entity1 has only released one complete tax return for 2010
@entity257 , @entity258 : @entity1 needs to be transparent about his finances
@entity1 's 2010 tax return reveals red flags about tax compliance issues , they say
@entity252 , @entity253 : electorate deserves a thorough vetting of presidential candidates
