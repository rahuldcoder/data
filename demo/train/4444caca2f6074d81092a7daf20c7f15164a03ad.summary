last week , i was among 14 @entity3 muslims who met with president @entity4 at the @entity5 , where i delivered a handmade @entity7 card from two @entity9 sisters , @entity10 and @entity11			2
@entity10 , who is 10 , told the president that she likes how he 's running the country , and that she plans to be an engineer or a basketball player when she grows up			2
she also wrote that she was worried about kids being mean to her because of her @entity19 faith and asked for the president 's help amid the growing crisis of @entity24 hate			1
this week , my heart sank as i read every parent 's worst nightmare in the news : three bright - eyed young @entity29 had been brutally slain in @entity30 , @entity31			1
@entity32 ; his new wife , @entity34 ; and her sister @entity35 were charitable , optimistic and promising individuals who were determined to make the world a better place , but whose lives were viciously ripped away			2
as the facts unfold , many indications lead us to believe that this is likely a hate crime			1
@entity34 's father has repeatedly stated that his daughter told the family that the neighbor did n't like them because of the way they looked			2
the accused killer 's social media posts frequently attacked religion			2
and the manner of death : bullets to the head			2
sadly , this incident is not an isolated tragedy			0
hate crimes and @entity24 bigotry have been escalating at an alarming rate , causing fear among families and communities of heinous attacks exactly like the one we witnessed in @entity31			1
in the last few months , we have seen public figures engage in rhetoric that has only added fuel to the fire of @entity24 hate and bigotry			1
just a few weeks ago , @entity75 state rep. @entity74 posted on her @entity77 page about an upcoming @entity78 where students get to engage with elected leaders			0
in her post , @entity74 indicates that she left " instructions to staff to ask representatives from the @entity19 community to renounce @entity87 terrorist groups and publicly announce allegiance to @entity29 " when they visit her office			1
a few months before , @entity74 posted that " muslims can not be trusted no matter how peaceful they appear			0
" earlier , in january , @entity92 gov. @entity91 warned @entity29 of fabricated " no - go zones " in the @entity29 where non-muslims are not allowed to go , and insisted that immigration by @entity19 should be viewed as an " invasion , " clearly not grasping the fact that @entity19 have been a part of @entity29 since their forced migration on slave ships			0
since the release of the movie " @entity105 , " we have seen ugly and threatening messages on social media			0
one @entity109 user said the film " makes me wan na go shoot some ( expletive ) @entity110			0
" another @entity109 user suggested that people look up the list of mosques and @entity87 schools in the @entity29 ( he provided them a link to a community website that compiles the names and locations of these institutions ) and then attack them with guns and other heavy ammunition pictured in his tweet			0
hate - filled rhetoric and threats of violence have popped up in every facet of our society			1
as a muslim , it is difficult to go about my life without my faith being attacked on social media , on mainstream cable news and in my community			0
at last week 's meeting , i asked the president to host a summit to examine discrimination directed at people of faith in @entity29			0
while @entity4 announced friday that the @entity145 has begun an inquiry into tuesday 's horrific killings in @entity31 , now , more than ever , we need the president and attorney general holder to speak from the podium and personally address the larger issue of @entity24 bigotry			1
furthermore , it is critical for @entity150 , our nation 's chief law enforcement officer , to direct and complete a rigorous federal investigation on the attack and make it clear that violence against anyone based on how they look or how they pray will not be tolerated			1
in fact , 150 organizations have signed onto a letter asking @entity150 for such an investigation			1
as @entity29 , we want all our children to grow up with the same opportunities			0
we want all our families to be able to practice our faiths and be part of communities that celebrate and welcome diversity			0
we want to keep our communities safe from acts of violence			0
today , @entity19 , @entity110 , @entity177 and @entity3 parents are hugging their children a little tighter , feeling helpless to protect them from others who hate them simply because of how they look or the way they pray			1
as we carry the torch for @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity35 and remember the great things they accomplished in their beautiful lives , let us also honor their memory by ensuring that young children such as @entity10 and @entity11 are not targets of future hate crimes			1
let us assure tomorrow 's rising stars that they can grow up in a world where they do n't have to fear their fellow @entity29			0
let us create a nation where @entity10 does n't feel the need to ask her president to protect her from hate .			2
