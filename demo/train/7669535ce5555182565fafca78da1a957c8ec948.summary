-- our genes play a major role in making us who we are , but a lot of information about their function has been mysterious			2
that 's why an international team of researchers set out to figure out what the working parts of the human genome are , and what they mean for the human body as we know it			1
the project is called the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
when the @entity21 sequenced the human genome in 2003 , it established the order of the 3 billion letters in the genome , which can be thought of as " the book of life			2
" @entity19 is about interpreting that -- understanding which genetic variants affect biochemical function , and which ones are associated with disease			1
" this is the science for this century , " said @entity34 of the @entity35 and lead analysis coordinator for @entity19 in a news conference wednesday			1
" this century , we are going to be working out how we make humans starting from this simple instruction manual			1
" @entity19 has begun to reveal the circuitry , networks and choreography within the human genome , said dr. @entity46 , director of the @entity47 , at the briefing			1
more than 30 scientific papers from the project are being published on it , in journals including nature , @entity54 and @entity55			2
scientists have determined that there are 4 million sites in the genome where specific biochemical events occur , most of which have been discovered with @entity19			1
that means if you got your genome sequenced , there could be as many as 4 million differences between you and the person sitting next to you , @entity63 , a @entity64 professor who is the principal investigator for @entity19 , told @entity0			1
these sites are " switches , " which determine which proteins and cells are going to be made , @entity71 of @entity72 , an @entity19 collaborator , said at the briefing			1
most genetic changes that are likely to cause disease , or are associated with disease , do n't lie inside the genes themselves , but rather in these control elements , @entity63 said			0
before , scientists believed that a lot of the human genome was junk -- that as little as 5 % of it actually had a purpose in encoding proteins , @entity71 said			1
so it was a surprise , according to @entity19 , to find a full 80 % of the human genome sequence is associated with some biochemical function			1
@entity19 allows researchers to identify which mutations are most likely to cause disease and drug responses			1
in a study on associations with diseases , scientists found links to heart disease and type ii diabetes			0
the regulatory switches can cause problems with genes that can lead to disease			2
" before , they were just mysterious events ; now we can say , ' well , they 're associated with a particular problem , ' " @entity63 said			2
@entity63 , who has had his own genome sequenced , believes personal genome sequencing will become an important part of health care			2
in his own case , genome sequencing revealed @entity63 's risk for type ii diabetes before his body started showing symptoms			2
since he knew about the risk ahead of time , he was able to start managing his glucose levels early			0
with the new @entity19 information , @entity63 could start seeing which variants he has that might affect gene function but do n't lie inside the gene ; they reside in the control switches			1
" i think this will become standard of care for many people , " he said of genomic sequencing			0
still , there are issues with how much information about a sequence should be revealed to a person -- after all , just because a person has a genetic link to a disease , it does n't necessarily mean that he or she will develop that condition , and the information could cause undue concern			0
before @entity19 , scientists ' knowledge was mostly about the exome , the protein coding sequences that account for about 1.5 % of the genome , @entity63 said			1
the remaining 98.5 % was mysterious until the @entity19 project			1
a genome sequence as part of a research project costs under $ 4,000 , but the proper interpretation costs a lot more , @entity63 said			2
some companies such as @entity164 dna testing at a relatively low cost , but only sequence part of the genome			0
even with what is known now , genome sequencing can benefit people with cancer			0
this technique played into the treatment of the late @entity175 ceo @entity174			0
he underwent a sequencing of the genes of his cancer tumor and his normal dna , so that his medical team could choose drugs that would be more precisely targeted at his disease , according to the biography " @entity174 " by @entity185			0
" in my mind , it 's a no - brainer to get your genome sequenced if you have cancer , " @entity63 said			0
the human genome has about 20,000 genes , and 1,000 of those genes are regulators -- the " government " of the genome , says @entity197 of @entity198			0
regulators bind to places in the genome , and then they turn genes near that binding site on and off			0
@entity197 and colleagues looked at the structure of these regulators , and determined that they have a somewhat corporate hierarchy structure			0
when you consider how information flows , it appears there are executives , managers and foremen			0
@entity19 received about $ 123 million over five years from the @entity47 , in addition to $ 40 for the pilot project and $ 125 million for relevant technology development and research since 2003			1
and there 's still much more work to do , scientists say			0
" it 's a project that 's not done , but it 's a big step forward , " @entity63 said			0
more from @entity223 : @entity224 constructed before birth would you want to get a full genome sequence to know your genetic risks ? why or why not ? tell us in the comments .			0

the @entity19 project finds more than 80 % of genome has biochemical function
there are 4 million sites in the genome where events occur , representing " switches "
" this century , we are going to be working out how we make humans , " a scientist says
