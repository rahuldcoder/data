@entity0 -- printed on the back of " the @entity4 " are the words " @entity2			2
" and it is just this sentiment that @entity8 needs to internalize now that we have a decision from the @entity11 in @entity12			1
as expected , the court of chief justice @entity14 took a decidedly regressive tack on campaign financing limits and granted corporations the same speech rights enjoyed by living , breathing persons			1
this is a bad decision			0
gone are the ban on the use of corporate treasury funds in federal elections and the requirement that corporations use political action committees to advocate for a candidate			1
corporations can now dip into their deep treasuries to spend on politics			0
corporate money may now be infused into elections in ways we can only begin to imagine			1
for @entity8 , this ruling comes in the runup to important midterm elections in 2010			1
the rules of the fundraising game have changed radically			0
with key issues like health care , climate change and regulation of the financial sector in play , the impulse for managers to pull out the corporate checkbook in an attempt to influence @entity8 will be great			1
not only are we likely to see money pouring into ads supporting key @entity55 and @entity56 committee members to curry favor , we are likely to see it flowing to ads supporting potential challengers as a way of threatening sitting lawmakers with ouster			0
but there can be sound policy responses to this change in the legal landscape			2
the key now is for members of @entity8 to not panic and take a moment to consider the possible options			1
adding corporate money into politics is like setting a brush fire			2
if the fire is contained and managed , it wo n't do much damage to the political culture			0
if it gets out of control , a whole territory can go up in flames			0
one possible policy response to @entity12 -- significantly raising federal contribution limits for individuals and parties -- would be like adding fuel to the brush fire , turning it into a conflagration			2
increased corporate money may encourage congressional and presidential races to turn into unprecedented arms races for funds			0
in the 2008 federal election , individual giving topped corporate pac funding , but in the wake of the @entity12 decision , this ratio could flip in 2010			0
corporate money could dwarf -- by many multiples -- dollars spent by individuals in every future @entity103 election			0
this would inevitably damage public trust in our system and open the door to the corruption that money can bring to politics			0
the @entity12 decision calls for thoughtful firebreaks to keep billions in corporate money from sweeping into our elections , to slow the progress of the corporate money wildfire			1
one immediate firebreak would be to change the securities laws to allow shareholders authority and oversight over corporate political spending			1
after @entity12 , corporate managers are free to spend corporate treasury money on politics without the knowledge or consent of their shareholders			1
the new law can be modeled on one from our peers in @entity132 , who since 2000 have required shareholder authorization for political spending by @entity132 companies			0
the @entity132 also requires @entity132 companies to report political spending to shareholders in annual reports			2
adopting this system in the @entity103 would give shareholders a way to check such spending of corporate managers			1
another , and perhaps the best available solution , is public financing for congressional elections			1
under the proposed @entity150 , sponsored by @entity151 , @entity152 , in the @entity55 and @entity153 , @entity154 , in the @entity56 , candidates for @entity8 who qualified after demonstrating some amount of constituent financial support would receive public grants to run a campaign			1
candidates would have an alternative to privately funded elections			0
so instead of being beholden to large individual donors or large corporate donors , congressional candidates could be un-bought and un-bossed			0
combined , these two approaches wo n't stop corporate money in politics completely the way the previous ban did ; but they would create protections to keep the corporate money brush fire contained rather than turning it into an out - of - control wildfire threatening the integrity of our democratic system			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 - @entity175			2

@entity175 : @entity11 ruling *loosening* campaign finance limits is mistake
she says it will start *firestorm* of corporate spending on elections
@entity8 should change laws to give shareholders oversight of donations , she says
@entity175 says public financing of elections would help push back at ruling
