-- last week , in her opinion piece titled " @entity5 's slick @entity4 ads fall short , miss the point , " @entity1 praised the @entity9 's recent @entity8 ads as a positive development , but she criticized us because those ads " were not enough			1
they 're not enough , and we never suggested they were			0
in fact , the ads , titled " honoring our past , @entity16 , " are just part of our @entity8 tribute , which in turn is just part of our year - round , nonstop engagement efforts with black voters and communities across the country			1
following the release of the @entity9 's @entity27 report last spring , the @entity9 , under chairman @entity29 ' leadership , set out to do things differently in the way it engages with minority voters			2
the need was especially urgent in my community , the black community			1
it 's there , in the black community , where we have the most ground to make up			1
in less than a year , the @entity9 has made strides to restart the conversation and build a presence in black communities across the country			1
as @entity29 noted at our second annual @entity47 , we 've hired black engagement state directors " from @entity49 to @entity50 , @entity51 to @entity52 and in between			1
" the @entity9 is hiring people who are from the community to work in the community , so they can get to know people and build relationships			1
these efforts are critical because people , regardless of background , do n't always care what you know until they know that you care			0
growing the party and recruiting the next generation of black @entity5 require that we build relationships in places we have n't always been			2
now , i 'll be the first to admit that even that is not enough			0
but it 's a big start in a short period of time and a major step in the right direction			0
the @entity9 recognizes that no matter how significant our efforts , we ca n't do it alone , but we do want to set an example for our fellow @entity5			1
in november , @entity29 traveled to @entity77 and hosted a round - table discussion with black business and community leaders at which he shared the party 's vision for reviving our urban centers			2
many republicans have stepped up to take similar actions , including @entity88 majority leader @entity87 and @entity90 chairman @entity89 and sens. @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			0
they 've shown they 're serious about growing the party and addressing voters ' concerns through policy proposals , listening sessions and visits to communities across the county			0
we 're happy to see that these @entity5 realize the importance of engagement efforts not only for the sake of our party but for the future of our country			1
unfortunately , when our efforts get discussed , it seems like they are always viewed only through the lens of political tactics			0
but the very reason that @entity5 seek to hold office is because we know that our principles , if properly applied , will improve lives by empowering people and communities			2
this includes offering parents a choice as to where their children go to school and fighting for adults who need jobs now			0
so while i appreciate @entity1 bringing attention to our efforts , i hope she 'll take the time to consider the breadth and depth of our engagement efforts in the black community			1
i hope she was n't ignoring them for the sake of diminishing our work to score political points			0
regardless , the hard work continues , because no matter what , it 's never enough			0
as long as there are voters who we have n't heard from or that have n't heard from us , there 's work to do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			2

@entity148 says @entity5 stepping up *outreach* to the black community
national *committee* 's ad campaign is not enough , he says ; we 're doing much more
@entity148 says @entity9 is hiring black engagement state directors across the country
