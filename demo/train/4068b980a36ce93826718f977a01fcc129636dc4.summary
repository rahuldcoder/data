-- seeking to stem what it calls media " misinformation , " @entity1 has broken what it calls its " deliberate silence " about the way it has dealt with sexual assault allegations that were raised against star football player @entity10 nearly two years ago -- allegations that he denies			1
in an open letter sent friday " to members of the @entity1 community " and the media , the university said it decided to share a time line of the case and the university 's responses			1
the reason for providing more detail , the letter stated , was " the continual drumbeat of misinformation about the @entity1 's actions ( that ) causes harm to our students , faculty , alumni , supporters and the @entity1 community as a whole			1
" the letter does not mention @entity10 by name , nor does it specify which facts of the case have been misrepresented in news reports			1
previously , the university would not comment on the investigation , citing state and federal student privacy laws			0
@entity1 is conducting a @entity44 investigation concerning an allegation that @entity10 , sexually assaulted a woman in a @entity48 bar in december 2012			1

-- the athletics department heard accounts from @entity10 and two other players who were present during the alleged encounter , and all three players said the event was consensual , the university said			2
-- the university says the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school 's @entity44 administrator because police filed no charges , and because of the players ' accounts , in which they said no sexual assault had taken place			1
-- the university says it took several steps to protect the woman 's identity and privacy			2
-- a @entity44 investigation was eventually opened after media inquiries were made into the incident , and local law enforcement had referred the case to the state attorney 's office			1
" the university takes sexual assault very seriously , " the letter states			0
" the university is also cooperating fully with the @entity123 investigation into this matter			0
indeed , it was the university that informed the doe nearly six months ago about the @entity128 knowledge of the case			0
" @entity130 , an attorney for the accuser , said in a email to @entity0 that the " obvious news in this statement is that senior athletic department officials met with @entity10 and his lawyer one month after " the alleged incident , " then decided to hide it from the @entity44 office			2
