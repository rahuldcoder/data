-- @entity1 and @entity2 showed they were rolling into top form ahead of next month 's @entity5 with impressive victories on either side of the @entity8 sunday			1
@entity1 put his personal difficulties behind him -- he broke off his engagement to tennis star @entity12 earlier in the week -- to win the @entity14 's flagship event at @entity15 , while @entity2 lived up to his billing as the new world number one with a playoff success in the @entity20 event in @entity21			1
both carded final rounds of 66 to achieve their wins , @entity1 by a shot from @entity27 's @entity26 at the @entity28 , while @entity29 @entity2 had to go to extra holes to beat @entity31			1
in doing so , he put paid to the chances of @entity34 's @entity33 snatching the top spot in the rankings			0
@entity33 had earlier finished seventh behind @entity1 and needed @entity2 to finish lower than 13th to claim the status			1
but there was no danger of that as the 2013 @entity41 champion rolled home several clutch putts in his four - under effort			0
he was tied on nine - under 271 with @entity45 , who also shot a 66 , but finally prevailed at the third playoff hole			2
" it 's so satisfying in so many ways to get it done , " @entity2 told the @entity48 official website			2
he had been four - over - par early in his first round before battling back through the field			0
the 25 - year - old @entity1 also trailed for much of the four rounds on the famous @entity54 , being seven shots behind tournament leader @entity56 going into the final round			1
but @entity56 , who opened with a superb 62 , finished with a round 13 shots more for a 75 to open the door for the likes of @entity1			1
" i played well , i played solid but i struggled friday , " @entity1 admitted afterwards			2
" i was fortunate today a few people made mistakes ahead of me , and i took advantage of that , " he added , referencing @entity56 's collapse from taking a five - shot lead into the last day			2
yet the tournament had been overshadowed by the media storm that followed @entity1 's announcement he was to split @entity12			1
the on - off relationship had been followed as keenly in gossip columns as it had on the sports pages , but the announcement , coming shortly after the wedding invites had been sent out , had created a cloud of publicity that stubbornly followed @entity1 around @entity15			0
" the wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realize that i was n't ready for all that marriage entails , " @entity1 said in a statement released to the press			0
" there is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people ... i wish @entity12 all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we 've had			0
i will not be saying anything more about our relationship in any setting			0
" @entity1 later admitted that focusing on golf helped him forget about his personal issues and as the week went on he found top form			0
his final round , included an eagle and six birdies , the final two on the 17th and 18th to post a 14 - under total which could not be matched			1
his @entity100 friend @entity26 got closest , finishing a shot back , with two - time @entity102 and @entity56 tied for third on 12 - under			0
it was @entity1 's first victory in @entity105 for 18 months and stands him in good stead ahead of his challenge in the @entity5 at @entity108 where he will be bidding to add to his 2011 success in the major			0
@entity2 and 2013 @entity111 winner @entity31 will also be hoping to carry their fine weekend form into the second major of the season in search of their own second triumph at golf 's highest level .			1
