@entity0 -- the @entity3 will proceed with a vote to force a sale of the @entity6 , rebuffing an effort by co-owners @entity9 and @entity10 to sell the franchise voluntarily , @entity3 spokesman @entity2 said friday			1
" we continue to follow the process set forth in the @entity14 regarding termination of the current ownership interests in the @entity6 and are proceeding toward a hearing on this matter on june 3 , " @entity2 said			1
his announcement followed reports earlier friday about how @entity9 and @entity10 agreed to a voluntary sale of the @entity3 franchise as the league prepares a vote on a forced sale , according to a source familiar with the situation			1
the couple have an agreement to allow @entity10 to do the negotiations , and there have already been discussions between her and the @entity3 , according to the source			1
attorneys for the @entity36 , who earlier declined to comment about the couple 's effort for a voluntary sale , were n't immediately available to react to @entity2 ' statement			2
the @entity6 declined to comment on the @entity3 statements , spokesman @entity42 said			2
friday 's events signal how the @entity3 is standing by its ultimatum that a vote will be held on a forcible sale			2
for their part , the @entity36 appear to be running out of options -- short of suing the league -- and analysts say such a lawsuit would n't be inconceivable , as @entity36 is an attorney well versed in litigation			0
meanwhile , pressure grows for @entity56 , a real estate billionaire			0
he faces a deadline tuesday to respond to the @entity3 's proposal to terminate his ownership in the team because of racist remarks he made			0
the @entity3 has banned @entity56 for life , and the league is advancing a vote by other team owners that would force the couple to sell the franchise			2
the ban and pending vote -- along with a $ 2.5 million fine against @entity56 -- arise from how he slurred african - americans			0
a voluntary sale would be a new maneuver for the @entity36			2
last week , @entity56 hired an antitrust lawyer to fight the @entity3 about the proposed forced sale			1
and his wife has said she wanted to keep an ownership stake in the team but does n't want to be the controlling partner			0
the couple own the team through a trust			0
they are also estranged , @entity10 's attorney has said			0
the @entity3 contends it was damaged by the 80 - year - old 's racist remarks to associate @entity90 , 31 , that were captured on an audiotape and posted online in april by @entity92 and in an interview with @entity1 's " @entity94 360Â °			0
" " among other things , mr. @entity10 disparaged african - americans and ' minorities ' ; directed a female acquaintance not to associate publicly with african - americans or to bring african - americans to @entity6 games ; and criticized african - americans for not supporting their communities , " the @entity3 said in a recent statement			1
in order to terminate the @entity36 ' franchise rights , three - fourths of the team owners ( 23 of 30 ) would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale			0
because @entity10 is banned from any @entity3 activities , he is not allowed to vote , but the @entity6 will have a vote , the @entity3 said			1
report : @entity3 says @entity56 asked @entity90 to lie @entity3 charges @entity56 , schedules june 3 vote @entity1 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			1
