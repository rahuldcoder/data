@entity0 , @entity1 -- at sunday mass in the suburbs outside @entity8 , a score of @entity5 catholics are praying for themselves and their families			1
they are part of a group of nearly 60 brought here in early november after a bloody massacre at their church in @entity17			1
in that attack , believed to have been carried out by @entity19 , 56 people died , including two auxiliary priests , and more than 70 were injured -- among them the parish priest of @entity23 , father @entity24			1
@entity24 was struck by grenade fragments during the attack , which went on for four hours			0
he was brought to @entity1 for medical treatment			2
the church did have some police protection , he says , but there are just too many threats against the @entity33 community			1
@entity34 , an @entity35 bishop who helps bring the religiously persecuted to @entity1 , points out that no one takes note of threats to the @entity33 community until there is a major attack			1
" there has been a @entity33 assassinated every single day since 2003			2
at least one , " @entity34 says			0
" you know , the news reports just get tired of it , because what 's new ? another @entity33 or two or 10 murdered today in @entity46 or @entity17 or elsewhere			1
" @entity34 says the @entity33 community of @entity5 , which numbered about 1.2 million before the war began , now is down to about 400,000 , with many moving out under the threat of death			1
after the attack in october , the number of people on waiting lists seeking refuge in @entity1 swelled to more than 4,000			1
no one wants to see such an ancient community disappear , says the bishop , least of all the refugees themselves -- but they have little choice			0
that 's certainly the feeling of " @entity64 , " who wants to keep his real name secret because he still has family he is trying to bring out of @entity5			2
the former government bureaucrat was wounded in the church attack and says he heard the gunmen say they want to drive @entity33 infidels out of the country			1
the last thing he wanted to do , he says , is to leave his homeland			0
" i am now in @entity1 , not my country , " says @entity64			2
" i have no job here			0
i had a very good job in @entity17 , a very good salary , my wife too , assistant professor			2
and now we will come here -- for what ? but if we have no protection to keep ourselves away from them , we must leave , and that 's why you see us here			0
" " i have memories			0
i have lots of feelings about @entity5 , especially @entity17 , " he continues , choking back tears			1
" so when i remember some of them i start to cry sometimes			0
i cry -- but what can we do ? it 's our destiny			0
" it 's a destiny now being played out thousands of miles from his home ,			0
