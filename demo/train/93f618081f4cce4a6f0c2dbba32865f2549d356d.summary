-- @entity1 had already telegraphed plans to attack terrorist targets in @entity4 , but the operation that unfolded over @entity4 skies overnight brought several significant and revealing surprises			1
here are five important ones : 1			0
@entity10 countries joined in attacking @entity11			1
it was always crucial that @entity13 keep this fight against the so - called @entity15 from becoming another @entity1 war , and especially that it deny extremists the ability to portray it as a war against @entity20 or against @entity10			1
this opening salvo in @entity4 is an important step in that direction			0
the @entity1 reported that @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , the @entity27 and @entity28 -- all @entity30 states -- " participated in or supported " strikes against @entity11 , which is also @entity30 and violently anti-shiite			1
the " supported " part probably applies to @entity28 , whose participation in any capacity is quite a surprise			0
@entity28 has actively backed the opposition against @entity4 president @entity38 , and many blame it for funneling the support that allowed @entity42 groups to emerge as the dominant segment of the anti-al - @entity38 forces			2
the @entity1 did n't just hit @entity11 , it targeted @entity48 's @entity47 's " imminent " attack on @entity1			1
this news bombshell was hidden in the @entity51 's press release , which said the @entity1 " took action to disrupt an imminent attack plotting against the @entity1 and @entity55 interests			1
" until now , the debate over whether or not the @entity1 should strike in @entity4 has referred specifically to the threat posed by @entity11 , but outside the @entity1 , there has been growing concern about the rise of @entity62 , a group made up of highly experienced @entity48 fighters			1
@entity64 said @entity1 forces -- without @entity10 participation -- struck explosives and munitions depots , training camps and other @entity62 facilities			1
by attacking @entity48 , the @entity1 is helping prevent another militant group from filling the vacuum when and if @entity11 loses strength in @entity4			1
defanging @entity62 would make it possible for moderate @entity4 rebels -- rather that @entity38 regime forces or other extremists --- to move in where @entity11 falls back			1
the rise of @entity11 has triggered jihadi competition to strike the @entity1			1
the emergence of @entity62 as a major player in @entity4 points to the intensity of rivalry between jihadi groups in @entity4			1
that is good news in the sense that @entity11 and @entity48 have more enemies , but it is extremely dangerous because jihadi groups are likely to try to upstage one another by hitting @entity1 and @entity55 targets			1
the @entity47 is headed by @entity93 , a 33 - year - old @entity94 who has topped most - wanted lists in many countries			1
he reportedly played a major role in the acrimonious breakup in @entity4 between @entity11 and @entity48			2
@entity100 and @entity11 leader @entity101 operate from a personal enmity			0
as @entity104 seeks to topple @entity48 as the leader of global jihad , it is reasonable to expect that the two organizations will compete for adherents and prestige by seeking to attack @entity1 and @entity110			1
@entity111 did n't respond , but a @entity4 fighter jet crossed into @entity113 and was shot down			0
the most daunting aspect of the fight against @entity42 extremists in @entity4 is that they seek to topple @entity38			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's position remains that @entity38 should leave power			2
the enemy of their enemy is no friend of the @entity1			2
@entity13 maintains that it did not seek permission from @entity38 to strike inside his country and there was " no coordination or cooperation " with either @entity4 or its ally , @entity127			2
@entity4 's foreign ministry says the @entity1 informed its @entity132 envoy before striking on its territory			1
@entity134 did not lift a finger to object to the violation of its airspace by a hostile military coalition			0
there was , however , another incident			0
@entity113 says that early tuesday a @entity4 fighter jet infiltrated @entity113 airspace and was shot down			0
the pilots ejected safely into @entity4 space			0
@entity113 says the plane flew half a mile into its territory and says it has no intention of becoming involved in the war in @entity4			0
it was the first time in more than two decades that @entity113 has intercepted a @entity4 military plane , and a retired @entity113 general told the @entity152 he thought the incursion was not deliberate			0
whatever triggered the incident , it is further evidence of just how dangerous the @entity4 conflict is , and how easily it could continue to expand into new territories			0
@entity1 's timing is smart , strategic and a little embarrassing			2
the timing of @entity1 's first direct hit inside @entity4 comes almost exactly a year after president @entity162 announced he would strike against @entity38 's forces because they had crossed his " red line " by using chemical weapons			1
now @entity162 is hitting @entity38 's enemies			2
the irony is more than a little awkward , but the timing could prove politically productive			0
the attacks came just hours before @entity162 's scheduled speech to the @entity172 , an annual gathering that not only provides an important platform to address the international community but also offers almost unlimited possibilities for face - to - face meetings with world leaders			2
the @entity1 is in the middle of a major diplomatic push to build up support against @entity11			2
at the @entity132 , @entity162 will make the case for the rightness of the cause against the murderous extremists seeking to terrorize the @entity186 and the world			0
he also needs to invigorate the push for a less sectarian government in @entity190 , so that the country 's @entity191 and @entity30 will join in the life - and - death struggle against @entity11			0
he will seek to enlist new allies in the fight and bring old ones -- notably @entity197 -- into line			0
after years of resisting intervention in @entity4 , after more than 200,000 people have died , millions have been displaced there , and after the @entity4 civil war has metastasized and spread , fracturing @entity190 and sending millions of refugees into @entity25 , @entity203 , @entity197 and elsewhere , the @entity1 finally decided to act			2
that it eventually would have no choice but to do so is hardly unexpected			0
but there are sure to be many more surprises in the months to come			0
there is ample irony in the timing and the occasion -- the highest - profile meeting of the world 's foremost peace organization -- but there is also news that the people in @entity11 - controlled parts of @entity4 are quietly celebrating @entity1 's newfound resolve .			1

@entity220 : the attack of @entity1 and allies on @entity11 targets in @entity4 offered several surprises
