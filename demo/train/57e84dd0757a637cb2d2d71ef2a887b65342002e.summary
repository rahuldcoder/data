@entity0 -- by now , top aides to president @entity3 , like @entity4 , have learned to just tune out the round - the - clock punditry that tends to build up every speech by this commander - in - chief as the pivotal moment in his presidency			1
the phrase " stakes are high " has been used so many times for speeches about anything from health care , to the tragedy in @entity19 , @entity20 , to the war in @entity22 , that the @entity24 communications director has voted with his remote control			0
" my tv is off , " @entity4 said wednesday , pointing up at the blank flat screen in his west wing office			0
" if you worried about @entity0 expectation - setting , you 'd never get anything done			0
" and yet here we go again with soaring expectations for @entity3 's thursday speech about @entity35 policy in the @entity36 -- though it 's worth noting the president himself brings on some of the attention by trying to pull so much into one address			1
as @entity4 told me , the president 's goal in delivering this speech is to " take it from the @entity46 through @entity22 and on to ( @entity47 ) @entity47 and put it in context for everyone			2
" whoa , that 's a lot to chew on in one speech			2
then throw in a section about the seemingly intractable @entity56 - @entity55 peace process -- plus attention - getting @entity24 meetings with @entity58 on tuesday and @entity56 prime minister @entity59 on friday -- and now perhaps you can see why expectations have gotten a bit out of control			1
@entity3 to lay out @entity65 vision and let 's not forget that it was the president who framed this whole issue in such sweeping terms when he went to @entity71 in 2009 to deliver the first - ever " speech to the @entity74 " by a @entity35 president			1
" i have come here to seek a new beginning between the @entity35 and @entity77 around the world , " he said then			2
" one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect , and one based upon the truth that @entity35 and @entity82 are not exclusive , and need not be in competition			0
" two years later , the @entity82 world is still skeptical -- and the region is a tinderbox despite @entity3 's victory of tracking down @entity47 and finally bringing him to justice			1
@entity3 's do - over on the @entity36 sure , people in places like @entity92 and @entity93 have gotten their first tastes of freedom			1
but the road to democracy is far from certain , and the economic inequities at the root of the original peaceful protests have not gone away			0
@entity102 president @entity101 is cracking down on peaceful protests in his own country , and a @entity22 dictator is still dug in after weeks of @entity107 military action			0
meanwhile , @entity109 president @entity108 has cut a reconciliation deal with @entity111 , considered a terrorist group in the @entity35			0
@entity3 's special @entity36 envoy @entity113 abruptly announced late last week that he 's heading for the exit			1
and while @entity59 is signaling he may be willing to give up more territory on the @entity116 to jump - start peace negotiations , his past unwillingness to compromise raises questions about whether this is a sincere bid for peace or just a gambit to show up the @entity55			0
oh yeah -- and while all of this has been happening , @entity124 has still been trying to get nuclear weapons , officials believe			0
other than that , @entity35 interests in the region are in fine shape			0
enter @entity3 , who has an opportunity to make some sense of the tumult of the last few months and lay out a clear vision of what the @entity35 can specifically do to help along some of these fledgling democracies			2
as @entity24 spokesman @entity140 noted this week , the pace of change has been " more in five months than we 've seen in 50 years in many ways in the region			0
" nevertheless , nobody should be so delusional as to think the president can solve all of these major problems with one speech at the @entity148			2
but maybe this can be a turning point , and here are four keys to the speech that will determine its effectiveness in the months ahead : @entity155 @entity3 is laying out a specific economic aid plan that includes about $ 2 billion for @entity92 as the @entity35 seeks to help get at the root cause of so much of the upheaval in the @entity36			1
the protests were not just about human rights , they were about the hunger of millions of young @entity162 who are simply looking for a job			0
some close observers are already dubbing this a @entity36 @entity166 -- a notion that administration officials are not knocking down -- but whether this will really have as much of an impact as @entity172 's efforts to rebuild @entity173 after @entity174 remains to be seen			1
@entity47 while it 's indisputable that taking out such a dangerous terrorist was a positive development , the @entity24 is going to have to be careful not to oversell the killing as the moment that somehow magically solves the region 's many challenges			2
one of @entity3 's top aides said before the speech that after " having taken out @entity47 " while also winding down the war in @entity185 , " we are beginning to turn the page to a more positive and hopeful future for @entity35 policy in the region			1
" there 's no question that @entity47 's death is a reminder to young @entity77 that there 's a better way than blindly following @entity196			0
but whether the @entity35 can translate that into future policy successes is still a question mark			0
@entity56 - palestinian peace people inside and outside the administration reading the tea leaves on @entity113 's exit from the peace process note that he was one of the people pushing for a specific @entity3 plan to try and bring a game - changer to the talks			1
@entity113 's departure foreshadowed the fact that @entity3 's speech would not give many new specific details from the president , which is why the real moment to watch will be friday when @entity3 and @entity59 sit down at the @entity24			1
everyone will be watching the body language and looking for some give from either side			0
but former @entity36 peace negotiator @entity221 of the @entity222 warns that nobody should get too hopeful			2
" you are going to have the optic of a ' @entity228 ' president on the peace process squaring off in a way against a ' no you wo n't ' @entity56 prime minister , " @entity221 said in an interview			2
@entity102 the @entity3 administration 's decision on wednesday to announce tough new sanctions aimed directly at @entity101 himself justifiably got lots of attention			1
after all , it was timed to tee up the president 's speech and inoculate him against criticism that the @entity35 has been too timid in taking on the @entity102 government			1
but perhaps the more noteworthy development was the sudden push by @entity3 officials to call for a " transition " to democracy in @entity102 , code for " it 's time for @entity101 to go			1
" this is important because it 's readily apparent @entity101 is not going gently into the night			0
as one person with close ties to the region warned privately this week , " it 's going to be very bloody " before it gets better -- a chilling reminder that for all of the hopeful talk of an @entity46 , @entity221 noted that this could quickly become the " @entity257			1
