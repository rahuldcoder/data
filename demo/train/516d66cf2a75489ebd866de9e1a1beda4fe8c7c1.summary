-- the woman and children held captive in a cellar for years by their incestuous father will take years to recover from their disturbing ordeal , doctors warned wednesday as the family at the center of the case remained in psychiatric care			1
the bathroom used by @entity12 , who was held captive for more than two decades , and her three children			1
members of the @entity12 family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives , officials said			1
@entity22 , the head of local social services said the family was " doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances " and said any change of identity would be the family 's decision			1
@entity12 -- now 42 -- spent more than two decades in the windowless basement after being drugged , handcuffed and locked up by her father , @entity33 , as an 18 - year - old			0
repeatedly raped , she gave birth to seven children by @entity37 , one of whom died as an infant			2
three of the children -- @entity42 , 19 ; @entity43 , 18 ; and @entity44 , 5 -- remained imprisoned underground with their mother			1
the other three lived in an apartment upstairs with @entity12 and his wife who believed @entity12 had abandoned them after running away from home			0
@entity12 and five of the children were continuing to receive treatment at a local clinic near @entity56 after being reunited on sunday			1
@entity42 , whose hospitalization at the weekend finally brought the family 's plight to the attention of authorities , remained in a coma at a nearby hospital			2
" it is astonishing how easy it worked that the children came together , and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together , " clinic director @entity64 said			1
but @entity64 warned that the family would require extensive counseling			2
" we 're talking of 20 years of darkness , incest and its effects and other illnesses they might have suffered from			2
" @entity64 said the two sets of children were tentatively getting to know one another , adding that the two boys who had lived underground had an unusual way of communicating with each other			2
a policeman who had accompanied the boys to hospital after their discovery on sunday said the pair had " screamed with excitement " during the car journey as they experienced the outside world for the first time			0
" the two boys appeared overawed by the daylight they had never experienced before , " said chief inspector @entity93			0
" the real world was completely alien to them ... we had to drive very slowly with them because they cringed at every car light and every bump			0
it was as if we had just landed on the moon			0
" in an interview with the @entity106 newspaper , @entity106 , psychiatrist @entity107 , who treated the abducted teenager @entity109 , estimated it would take " between five and eight years " for the children to recover from their experiences			1
another psychologist , @entity113 , told @entity106 television that it would be impossible for the four held prisoner underground to lead normal lives			1
" i am afraid it is too late for that			0
" @entity109 , the @entity106 girl abducted as a 10 - year - old and held captive in a basement for more than eight years until she escaped in 2007 , also offered her help to the family on tuesday , but questioned the decision to move them from the cellar into psychiatric care			1
" pulling them abruptly out of this situation , without transition , to hold them and isolating them to some extent , it ca n't be good for them , " said @entity109 , now 20 , in an interview with @entity106 tv station @entity129			2
" i believe it might have been even better to leave them where they were , but that was probably impossible			0
this case is not like mine , where that was not my environment			0
they were born there and i can imagine that there is a strong attachment to that place			0
