@entity0 , @entity1 -- a day after the @entity1 president indicated that he would n't run again , protesters peacefully took to the streets in tense @entity8 nation 's capital to protest his rule			1
thousands of people congregated in front of the @entity12 in @entity0 , and chanted slogans such as " get out ! " and " freedom for @entity1 ! " @entity15 , a pro-opposition lawyer who was in the throng , said protesters want a " regime change , " the resignation of president @entity21 @entity20 , and lawsuits addressing the regime 's corruption			1
@entity1 has been wracked by angry demonstrations , with citizens protesting high unemployment , alleged corruption , rising prices , limitations on rights , and anger with the government 's performance			1
the wave of protests was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate , a man who torched himself in december after police confiscated his fruit cart			0
in an address on national tv on thursday night , @entity20 addressed the crisis in a speech that came as street unrest percolated and a message purportedly from an @entity48 affiliate announced its support of protesters			1
he vowed to cut prices of basic foodstuffs , to lift censorship and to ensure police do not use live ammunition except in self - defense , and indicated that he will not run again for president			1
" enough violence , " @entity20 said on national television after days of riots that have killed at least 21 people			0
" i also gave orders to the interior minister ... not to use live ammunition			0
it is unacceptable and unjustified unless someone uses his weapon and forces you to defend yourself			0
" @entity20 said he had asked the prime minister to reduce prices of staples , including sugar , milk and bread and said he had decided to give " complete freedom to all media outlets ... as long as they respect our values and the value of the profession			0
" the 74 - year - old president added that he would not push to change the law setting an age limit for presidential candidates in the next election in 2014			2
by then , he would have exceeded the 75 - year age limit			0
" there will not be presidency for life , " he said			0
organized mainly by the country 's lawyers ' union mainly and other unions , the crowd on friday was under the watchful eye of a contingent of riot police officers			2
but the protesters freely were not shy about slamming the government and @entity20 's rule			2
demonstrators shouted " public trial for the president 's family ! " and " yes to water and bread , but no to @entity20 ! " @entity108 , a 37 - year - old university professor , told @entity2 that the protesters say the ruling family have robbed citizens and they want them to depart from public life			1
@entity108 says that @entity20 's speech was staged and was cynical about the presence of a pro-government demonstration after his speech			1
" we do not believe in @entity20 and his regime , " she said .			0
