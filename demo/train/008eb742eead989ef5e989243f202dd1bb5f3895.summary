@entity0 -- president @entity2 's @entity4 address and the traditional post-speech road trip were designed to boost both his agenda and @entity8 chances in this difficult election year			1
but there were instant reminders of the tough terrain , and internal @entity8 jitters : the @entity8 candidate for governor of @entity16 was nowhere to be found when the president visited ; that after several vulnerable @entity18 publicly tried to create distance between their re-election bids and @entity2			1
@entity2 @entity4 themes are @entity18 ' 2014 playbook and then , this , in an exclusive conversation with @entity1 's @entity24 : @entity24 : " it 's possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in this country , but not citizenship			1
would you veto that ? " @entity2 : " well , you know , i 'm not going to prejudge what gets to my desk			2
" @entity1 exclusive : @entity2 says he 's not recalibrating expectations on its own , maybe that 's just a conciliatory tone so as not to become part of the @entity45 's debate about immigration			1
but the timing makes the president 's open mind more significant			0
@entity51 @entity50 just wednesday said of the immigration debate : " in our caucus there has to be a path of citizenship			2
" and speaking to the @entity62 , @entity59 president @entity58 , whose unions are vital to @entity8 midterm campaign chances , said of a @entity45 plan that provides legal status but not a guaranteed path to citizenship for illegal immigrants : " it 's a joke			1
it 's a hoax , is what it is			0
it 's like fool 's gold			0
" so @entity2 is now on record saying he wo n't prejudge an idea that is a nonstarter to the top @entity77 @entity76 and a " joke " to organized labor			1
and he is not only at odds with those two traditional allies -- he is at odds with himself			0
a year ago , speaking in @entity84 , the president laid out his bottom line : " for comprehensive immigration reform to work , it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship , " he said then			1
the president 's refusal to draw a veto line on the citizenship question will make his liberal base anxious , and those tensions could hurt in an election year			2
frustrated liberals start to look beyond @entity2 but whether liberal disappointment now turns into a political problem closer to @entity102 depends in large part on whether @entity45 can test the president 's openness by getting a bill to his desk			1
and that remains a giant question mark			0
speaker @entity110 wants the @entity77 to pass , in several pieces , immigration changes that would include citizenship for so - called " @entity114 " -- younger undocumented people who were brought illegally into the @entity116 by their parents -- but guarantee only legal status for older undocumented individuals			1
@entity77 @entity45 leaders unveil immigration standards if the @entity77 were to act , it would then need to try to reconcile its ideas with already passed @entity18 legislation			1
@entity18 control the @entity18 , and finding common ground , again assuming the @entity77 acts , likely would prove difficult			0
but , for now , the biggest question is whether the @entity77 will act			0
@entity110 not only believes the changes are good economic policy , he also is trying to help his party deal with a @entity134 voter crisis that significantly complicates any @entity45 @entity77 aspirations			1
but many @entity45 members of @entity137 are worried more about their 2014 races and angering the conservative base , whose turnout is critical in the midterm environment			2
most @entity77 @entity45 believe any immigration debate distracts attention from @entity144			2
and on the @entity18 side , there is less urgency as well because of the states the @entity45 is targeting in its effort to retake control			2
the 11 seats now held by @entity18 that are the top @entity45 targets have relatively small @entity134 populations			0
but in each of those , conservative @entity45 base turnout would be critical if the race is close come november			0
the speaker understands that he is at center stage at the moment , and that any chance to see the @entity8 immigration tensions in full force depends on whether the @entity77 can first advance something meaningful			0
" it 's been turned into a political football , " the speaker said thursday of the immigration debate			1
" so i think it is time to deal with it			0
but how we deal with it is going to be critically important			0

several vulnerable *democrats* put distance between themselves and @entity2
progressives , labor say @entity45 ' immigration principals come up short
a year ago , @entity2 said there would be no reform without pathway to citizenship
immigration has been turned into a " political football , " speaker @entity110 says
