-- can just traveling to a city make you better looking ? @entity2 would say so			1
on a recent visit to southern @entity6 , the @entity4 real estate agent was struck by the gorgeous scenery — as in , the people			2
she chalked it up to the locals ' regular access to sand , surf , and sunshine			0
" after one week there , i actually looked and felt healthier , " she says			0
" my skin was glowing , my hair was shiny , and even my nails grew — and they never grow			0
" given the area 's seemingly magical powers of osmosis , it 's no wonder that both @entity23 and @entity24 made it into the top five cities for @entity28 's best - looking people , according to @entity30 readers			1
new results are in from the annual @entity28 's @entity33 survey , in which readers rate 35 metropolitan areas for qualities such as people - watching , walkable streets , and hot music scenes			1
this year , the attractive locals category saw a fair amount of movement : the new number 1 city is a past champ that had previously fallen from grace , and several cities have made impressive rebounds in the rankings or else seemingly let themselves go			1
( what happened , @entity51 ? ) while plenty of the top 20 cities offer the potentially transformational elements that @entity2 found in @entity56 , other winners offered proof that being gorgeous is more than skin deep			1
@entity60 ( or downright chilly ) cities such as @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63 fared just fine — and also ranked well with readers for being friendly			1
@entity30 : @entity28 's most romantic cities one new category in this year 's survey may have also boosted chemistry : a charming accent , something @entity30 readers found lacking with the folks of @entity73 and @entity74 , who also ranked among the less attractive			1
of course , a key ingredient in attraction is a solid fashion sense and that may be a reason that some sunny cities landed near the bottom			2
" locals in @entity86 know what they are to the world " — a giant theme park — " and do n't even try anymore , " says @entity83 , a @entity84 - based freelance writer			0
" since it 's warm much of the year , shorts and a pullover shirt , plus tennies , takes them everywhere , " she says			0
" even @entity96 ca n't work that look			0
" number 1 : @entity98 did they do something new with their hair ? these party - loving @entity103 have reclaimed the top slot this year , which they have n't held since 2009			2
they also ranked in the top 10 for their fashion sense and fit physiques			1
see for yourself over drinks at one of the city 's highly rated cocktail lounges			0
the only downer : @entity114 also ranked as being pretty aloof			0
number 2 : @entity23 it 's hard to argue with a beauty regimen of fresh air and miles of beaches for staying in shape			0
this @entity56 city has consistently ranked as the first runner - up for good looks in @entity30 's survey , even if readers tend not to be so impressed with the locals ' conversational skills			1
@entity128 do , however , score well for being tech - savvy			0
number 3 : @entity129 , @entity130 last year 's winner slipped a few spots this year , but the island city is still a magnetic place for mingling with a good - looking crowd : it also ranks in the top three for its happy hour and singles scene			1
readers downgraded the @entity130 city for its sense of style , but they were suckers for the fabulous local accent			1
@entity30 : @entity28 's best cities for singles number 4 : @entity148 that voters are a little fickle : this @entity151 city was no. 1 for attractive locals in 2010 , but fell to no. 7 last year			1
while readers still find the locals to be charming — and think that the city makes a great romantic getaway — they were easily distracted by all the good shopping , ranking the city in the top five when it comes to antiques , design stores , and indie boutiques			1
number 5 : @entity24 it 's easy to make jokes about some locals having " work " done			0
but whatever the reason , @entity169 have ranked in the top five for looks in the last three out of four years , and they won the silver medal this year for their fashion - forward style			1
they 're also trying that catch - more - flies - with - honey strategy : their niceness factor went up by three positions since last year			0
number 6 : @entity177 cowboy hat sets off the face nicely , does n't it ? @entity62 jumped up seven places in the attractiveness category since last year , even if it lost its grip on the top spot in the survey for music			2
if you want an alternative to the honky - tonks , look for any crowd wearing @entity190 team shirts : @entity62 ranked no. 3 for its sports bars			0
number 7 : @entity192 in the @entity194 capital seem to be simultaneously quirky , smart , and buff : the only personal quality that voters were less - than - smitten with was perhaps residents ' tendency toward hipster fashion			0
look for them hanging out by the no. 2 -- ranked food trucks or dining on gourmet burgers			0
@entity30 : the best and worst airports to find a date number 8 : @entity212 if these @entity209 ever said anything unattractive or rude , voters might not even notice , so blinded were they by the top - ranked local drawl			1
voters were also charmed by these southerners ' willingness to indulge themselves : the handsome city ranked no. 3 for its happy hour , and no. 1 for ice cream parlors			2
number 9 : @entity225 despite the fashion gambles of occasional floral shirts and muumuus , the @entity221 are regulars in the attractive top 10 for their compelling mix of diversity , fitness , and a mellow attitude			2
it can only help that the @entity234 city won the top spot in the survey 's weather category			2
number 10 : @entity61 / @entity241 after a two - year absence , the @entity239 have returned to the top 10 , perhaps because locals nicely walk the line between nerdy and outdoorsy : they won the survey for smarts , and the cities ranked no. 1 for their parks			1
readers were also impressed by the @entity251 ' refined tastes in beverages , so to mingle , head to the local micropubs and coffeehouses			0
