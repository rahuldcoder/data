-- double amputee sprinter @entity1 has moved a step closer to realizing his dream of participating in the @entity4 after running the ' b ' standard qualifying time for next year 's games in @entity7			1
the 24 - year - old , who was born without fibulae in both legs , clocked 45.61 seconds to win the 400m race at the @entity12 in his home town of @entity14 in @entity15 on wednesday			1
dubbed the ' @entity1 ' because of his carbon fiber prosthetic limbs , @entity1 must now run 0.6 seconds faster to be granted automatic qualification			1
but his time could still be good enough to earn him a place in the @entity15 team depending on the performance of other athletes			2
after narrowly missing out on the time required for the @entity27 , the @entity25 - born athlete expressed his delight at the achievement on his @entity31 page			0
" one of the best nights of my life			0
ran a 45.61sec 400m @entity36 qualifying time and fastest time in @entity15 , " @entity1 , whose legs were amputated when he was just 11 months old , wrote			1
" thanks to everyone who has supported and believed in me in my quest to 2012 @entity4			0
i 'm hungry for it			0
" after finishing sixth at his @entity43 in 2007 , @entity1 was blocked from competing alongside his able - bodied counterparts as his blades were considered to give him an unfair advantage			0
but in 2008 the @entity47 ruled in favor of the four - time @entity50 champion after a lengthy legal battle with the @entity52			2
should he make it to @entity4 , @entity1 would become the first amputee sprinter to compete in an @entity4			1
he first competed in the @entity50 in @entity55 in 2004 , where he won gold in the 200m and bronze in the 100m , after having only taken up the sport eight months previously			0
his compatriot @entity61 , a single amputee swimmer , and @entity63 , a @entity64 table tennis player who was born with one arm ending just below her elbow , competed at both the @entity36 and @entity50 in @entity67			1
his new personal best time , 0.41 seconds better than his previous fastest , could also allow him to compete in the @entity69 , which take place in @entity71 , @entity72 later this year .			2
