-- @entity1 would love it if everyone channeled " frozen " and just " let it go			1
" the @entity6 rapper has broken her silence about a supposed feud between herself and @entity9 , rumors that were sparked after @entity9 gave a curiously pointed acceptance speech at the @entity12 on sunday			1
the @entity14 - bred @entity13 made it clear that when " you hear @entity9 spit , @entity9 wrote it , " leaving observers to assume that she was taking a dig at @entity21 , who 's been rumored to work with ghostwriters and was @entity9 's competitor at the awards ceremony			1
@entity9 vs. @entity1 : where 's the beef ? although @entity9 said during her acceptance speech that she was n't giving " shade " -- aka , disrespect -- it nonetheless appeared that way to many			1
with the @entity33 chomping down on the apparent beef , both @entity9 and @entity21 have tried to clear the air			1
" the media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different			2
i will always take a stance on women writing b / c i believe in us ! " @entity9 tweeted on july 2			1
" i 've congratulated @entity1 on the success of ' fancy , ' publicly			1
she should be very proud of that			2
all the women nominated should b proud			2
... that will never change my desire to motivate women to write			0
our voices have to be heard			0
i hope i inspire up & coming females to do that			0
" @entity21 initially remained silent on the subject , but by july 3 the rapper had grown tired of the commentary			2
" i have to say the general explosion of pettiness online in the last few days is hard to ignore and honestly ... lame , " @entity21 wrote in a statement , as captured on her @entity61 account			0
" if i had won the @entity12 award that would 've been great but it was n't my year and i do n't mind -- so you should n't either			0
" and that 's not all : " generally speaking , " @entity21 continued , " i 'm unbothered by anything that ' happened ' at the @entity12 awards , and just feel worn out by everyone trying to make me have wars with people all the time			0
anyone who wishes me well is welcome in my life and those who do n't ca n't get any more of my time			0
i hate to see everyone exhausting themselves on my behalf over things that i 'm still not sure even exist and do n't matter			0
