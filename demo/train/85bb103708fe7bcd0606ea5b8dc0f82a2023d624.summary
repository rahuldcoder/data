-- who does n't like getting those retail discounts or free gift coupons from their favorite stores ? but did you know there were strings attached , invisible eyes tracking your every consumer move ? and there 's little you can do to stop it			0
we want to do something about that			0
businesses have long sought to attract and retain customers by recording and analyzing your shopping and lifestyle habits			0
to do so , they often rely on " data brokers " -- companies that collect and share our personal information and label us based on what they learn			1
and they do this mostly without our knowledge			0
that fashionable handbag you found on sale ? they know about it			0
that great deal you got on the bbq grill from the hardware store ? they 're tracking that too			0
and that box of @entity41 ? they already assumed you were going to buy that before you even entered the store			0
the data broker industry has been booming in recent years , due to new technologies that enable the collection of massive quantities of our personal information			1
because of the sheer volume of data we leave in our wake when we shop , browse the web , order a magazine , or post to social media sites , we are largely giving them all this valuable information			0
data brokers scoop up the digital breadcrumbs we leave as we shop in stores and online , and apply " big data " analytical tools to predict where we 're going , what we 'll buy , and what we 'll do -- sometimes even before we know ourselves what we 'll buy next			1
there 's no question that the personal information that data brokers sell to retailers , financial firms , hotels , airlines and other businesses can provide benefits to consumers and our growing digital economy			1
it can help direct goods and services that are tailored to our interests and assisting businesses to combat fraud by verifying consumers ' identities			0
they also take this information and use it to lump us into various , shorthand categories like " @entity94 " and " @entity95			0
" but if a data broker categorizes you as an " @entity98 , " meaning a low - income minority , are you more likely to receive an offer for a payday loan than a credit card ? what are the implications of being labeled as " financially challenged ? " will it mean you are cut off from being offered the same goods and services , at the same prices , as your neighbors ? do you want a company to know that you have diabetes , high cholesterol , or another medical condition as long as it is willing to pay the going rate for health data ? most @entity116 do n't even know that data brokers exist , let alone that they collect and trade a staggering amount of our personal data			1
brokers operate invisibly , buying and selling data about us without interacting directly with us			2
too few offer easy ways for us to access our information or opt - out of their system of data collection			2
the @entity130 , a bipartisan agency that works to protect consumers , is seeking to shed light on this largely unknown industry			2
the @entity130 has just released a detailed study of nine data brokers			1
we found that data brokers collect billions of pieces of data on nearly every @entity116 consumer , often merging online and offline information			2
data brokers are also making potentially sensitive inferences about consumers -- about their health , financial status , and ethnic backgrounds			1
and consumers have little if any window into this process , let alone meaningful control or choice about how their data is shared among businesses			2
this week , the @entity130 has called on @entity153 to improve the transparency of the data broker industry , and to provide consumers more control over their personal information			1
we also recommend that @entity153 require data brokers to create a centralized website , among other measures , so that consumers can access their own data and opt out of data collection and retention			1
i also believe data brokers should be required to take reasonable steps to ensure consumer information is not used for unlawful purposes , such as to illegally discriminate			2
we need better transparency into how data brokers collect and use our personal information to help ensure that we not go down a path that leads to unfair exclusion , but rather one that widens opportunities for all consumers			1
