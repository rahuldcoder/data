@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 opened the first of potentially several bays of the @entity6 on saturday afternoon , a move intended to spare some areas from severe flooding while redirecting water into others			1
" we think there is a successful operation going on right now , " col. @entity12 , the @entity13 district commander , told @entity2 an hour after the first floodgate was opened			1
@entity12 explained that the difficult decision to open the spillway , and similar ones made in recent weeks , is being done to address a historic excess of water in the @entity24 system , including its tributaries			1
on saturday afternoon , the river was cresting near @entity31 , @entity32 , at 56.4 feet -- 12.4 feet above the flood stage , the level at which the river may begin flowing over its banks -- the @entity26 noted on its website			1
that crest , or high point of water , was moving slowly and steadily southward			0
the move in @entity1 , about 115 miles northwest of @entity39 , will lower anticipated cresting levels -- as well as lessen the potential for severe flooding caused by things like overtopped levees and cracks in flood - control structures -- along the rising @entity24 and divert water from @entity48 and @entity39			1
but it will flood parts of low - lying south - central @entity0			1
@entity12 said that one or two other additional bays of the flood - control structure would likely be opened sunday , and more gates could be opened later depending on water levels			1
the @entity3 could choose to let out as much as 600,000 cubic feet of water per second , with saturday 's opening leading to the release of 10,000 cubic feet per second			1
" as the river needs it , we 'll open it , " said @entity12 , referring to the spillway 's bays			1
by 2:30 p.m. saturday , all those " within the first 24 hours " -- meaning , those who should see flooding caused directly by the spillway 's opening -- had evacuated , @entity12 said			1
the opening came after several days of warning , as residents in the flood zone prepared to move to save their lives , even if their homes were washed away			2
@entity0 gov. @entity76 predicted this week the high water resulting from the @entity1 spillway opening could impact 3,900 people and 2,600 structures			1
" right now , a lot of people are real nervous about it			0
it 's sad , " said @entity84 , a resident of @entity85 , a town that could face flooding because of the spillway 's opening			1
" we need to have protection so that they do n't flood us			2
" he said his subdivision would likely be fine , as it was built at a relatively high elevation , but that his neighbors were building additional levees and putting out sandbags			0
seven @entity0 parishes -- @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 -- will likely be affected by the first opening of the spillway since 1973 , according to the @entity3			1
@entity12 said saturday that the spillway will likely be open for weeks , and it will be at least until that long that those who have evacuated can safely return			2
that 's because that , even after the river crests at a certain point , it will take considerable time -- in some cases , weeks -- before it falls back below the flood stage			1
@entity117 , which sits on the banks of the @entity119 , is among those communities expected to see rising water			2
@entity122 has joined with state and local authorities to build - up safeguards in that community of about 11,600 people , according to the @entity128			2
" really , we 're just waiting , " said @entity129 , who has lived in @entity117 for 50 years			0
officials believe that the levees will protect the city from flooding , but some are taking preliminary precautions , she said			2
at @entity138 , where @entity129 works , people spent the day friday moving important documents such a baptismal , marriage and financial records to the second floor			0
" most people are getting their photographs together , things that you ca n't replace in case you have to go , " she said			0
the river 's slow pace has given emergency responders more time to prepare , forecasters said			2
but while the slow - moving water gives residents extra time to get ready , it also means that land could remain under water for some time			0
@entity0 state authorities have been working with federal and local counterparts to combat flooding -- or , in some cases , prepare for it -- in 19 of its 64 parishes			1
that includes bringing in 700 @entity170 , as well as state police officers and prison inmates to lay down sandbags , direct traffic and otherwise deal with the crisis , the state 's office of homeland security and emergency preparedness said in a release saturday			1
they have brought in and laid out thousands of linear feet of @entity180 flood - control material , as well as rought in hundreds of yards of reclaimed asphalt , sand and other substances aimed to keep floodwaters at bay			2
the @entity26 said that as of noontime saturday , the river was at 16.8 feet in @entity39 , just a fraction below flood stage			1
it is expected to crest may 23 at about 19.5 feet			2
the @entity13 levees are built to withstand 20 feet , according to the weather service			0
still , the effects there could be felt soon : the @entity193 said floodwaters could close the @entity24 to ships at the @entity39 port as early as monday morning			1
to help @entity39 , the @entity3 said friday that it will open 52 more bays at the @entity198 just north of the city , diverting water into @entity201			0
that will mean a total of 264 bays will be open in the 350 - bay spillway			0
in @entity207 , @entity24 , the river is expected to crest at 57.5 feet may 19			1
this would be significantly above the flood stage at @entity207 of 43 feet			0
homes that were built between the levee and the @entity24 were the first affected			1
" we estimate that every home built on the river side of the levee from @entity218 all the way to the @entity0 line is flooded , " said @entity212 , executive director of the @entity213			2
residents near @entity207 counted on a levee for protection			0
in addition to the mainline levee along the river , starting near @entity207 and extending northeast for more than 20 miles , a so - called backwater levee offers shelter			0
the backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the @entity231 delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it			0
that level is expected to be reached monday , said @entity236 , attorney for the @entity237			0
the backwater levee was being " armored " by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out , he said			0
" there 's a chance it might not make it through an over-topping event , " said @entity240 chief engineer @entity239 about the backwater levee			0
" there is a risk			0
we do n't think it will break , but we want people to be prepared			0
" " it 's hard to plan for a multi- 100 - year event , " he said			0
nonetheless , 1.4 million acres in @entity24 , including 602,000 acres where crops are growing , could flood , said @entity255 of the state 's @entity256			1
across the @entity260 and lower @entity261 , floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland , eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn , wheat , rice and cotton , officials said			0
@entity2 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
