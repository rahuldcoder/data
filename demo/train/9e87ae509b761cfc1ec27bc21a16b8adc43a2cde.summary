@entity0 they 're railing against president @entity3 for going too far on @entity4 and immigration but @entity6 are prepared to cede broad authority to the @entity8 to fight @entity9			1
it 's an interesting theme that 's developing as the administration prepares to send @entity12 a request as soon as wednesday that would authorize @entity3 to use military force against @entity9 in @entity15 and @entity16			1
democrats , wary of another long war , are seeking strict limits on the use of @entity22 ground forces			1
republicans , meanwhile , are the ones arguing that the commander - in - chief needs room to move as he sees fit			1
@entity28 sen. @entity27 , the chairman of the @entity29 , does n't want to see any restrictions in the authorization -- meaning no limit on the use of ground troops , the length of time the authorization can remain in force and no restrictions on the geographic area to which the new law would apply			1
" if we want to constrain the president 's actions , we have the power of the purse , " @entity27 said tuesday			1
" the @entity46 says the president of the @entity22 is the commander in chief			1
" several other @entity6 senators speaking in the days before language for the so - called @entity50 for the @entity51 , or @entity52 , was expected to be released by the @entity8 declined to weigh in on what they could support , but emphasized the need to give the @entity8 as much flexibility as needed to wage this fight			0
" i 'm sort of a traditionalist on this maybe			0
i think the executive branch ought to be telling us they want flexibility , " said sen. @entity60 , stressing his concern the @entity8 would take certain options off the table			0
" i think it 's wrong for the commander in chief to tie his own hands			1
" while details are still being finalized , the @entity8 is expected to request a three - year @entity52 that places some limits on the use of @entity22 ground forces , according to members of @entity12 briefed on the proposal			1
the @entity28 is hardly monolithic on this issue -- or any other -- but many in the party do not want to see the president limited on matters of war			1
and the battle against @entity9 is just one example of @entity6 ' willingness to grant the president wide authority on specific issues , even as they question his use of power in other instances			1
many top @entity28 members are also pushing fast - track , or @entity92 , known in @entity0 as @entity92 , which would allow the president to get an up or down vote in @entity12 -- without amendments -- on often complicated trade deals negotiated largely in secret by the executive branch , as long as they meet certain parameters			1
so is there a disconnect here ? @entity6 have been furious over @entity3 's use of executive power in other areas , from adjustments he made to @entity4 requirements to his moves on immigration in november			1
the party has filed lawsuits against the president claiming executive overreach on the health care law and plan to do something similar on immigration			2
@entity117 @entity28 sen. @entity116 said the battle against extremists and the one against the healthcare bill should not be compared			2
" disliking a single - payer government health care system like the @entity4 and fighting an enemy like @entity123 are two entirely different things , " he said			0
" you 're talking about policy and direction in terms of the health care law and you 're talking about the survival of our democracy , you 're talking about terrorism			0
" distrust of the president is a common theme on @entity137			2
many members have long argued that the @entity8 can not be relied on to enforce immigration law or secure the border , so there is little point , they argue , in pushing through a comprehensive immigration overhaul			0
" there 's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws , " house speaker @entity144 said last february			0
" and it 's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes			0
" in response to those claims , @entity153 sen. @entity152 proposed in february 2014 to pass the immigration bill , but not have it go into effect until 2017 , when a new president would be in office , said a spokesman			2
the @entity28 did n't bite			2
the dynamic opens @entity6 up to questions about whether they can have it both ways , expressing alarm and distrust about how @entity3 uses his powers on health care and immigration while backing him on trade and -- perhaps his biggest responsibility -- waging war			2
" it is kind of inconsistent on their part			0
on the other hand , presidents have always been given much , much greater leeway to use their power in international economics and in defense and security issues , " said @entity176 , a senior fellow in the @entity178 program at the @entity179			2
" it 's not surprising that the issues break like this			0
" while the public often has strong opinions on domestic matters like immigration or health care , the same is not true for issues like @entity92			0
that means the opposing party can claim immense distrust of the president on one issue while giving him free rein on another			2
" nobody knows what @entity92 is and nobody cares and therefore the fact that there 's a muddled message around it does n't become evident , " @entity176 said			0
" these lucky politicians can have it both ways , as they do with many things			0
" for their part , republicans questioned by @entity1 said their support for the president 's use of power on some matters was part of the job , otherwise nothing would ever get done in @entity0			1
" my job as a senator is to do the best that i can to pass legislation that i believe is important and is in our national interest , " said @entity224 sen. @entity223 , a strong supporter of @entity92			0
" even though i may have concerns about the executive branch and the way that they would carry things out from time to time , that still does n't mitigate my job or alleviate the job that i have which is to try to pass legislation that is meaningful and good for our country			0

republicans often *criticize* @entity3 for overstepping his power
but the @entity28 says military power is different
