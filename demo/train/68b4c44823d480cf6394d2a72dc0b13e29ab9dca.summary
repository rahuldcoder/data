do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other ? " @entity86 does n't care that @entity87 and @entity88 were n't there it may have been @entity13 and @entity3 's wedding , but all anyone wanted to know was whether @entity87 and @entity88 were going to be there			1
