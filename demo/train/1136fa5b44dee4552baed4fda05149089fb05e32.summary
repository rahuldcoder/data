@entity0 -- the @entity3 opposition is blaming pro-government militia members for the slaying of a prominent @entity7 militant in his house outside @entity9			1
he was @entity12 member @entity11 , a former deputy of @entity13 , who was slain in @entity14 in 2010 , a death many observers blame on the @entity18 spy agency @entity17			1
@entity13 was one of the founders of @entity12 ' military wing			0
the @entity21 , which opposes the regime of @entity3 president @entity23 , said the pro-government @entity25 militia tortured @entity11 to death and " set his house on fire to destroy the evidence of their heinous crime			1
" the killing comes amid tensions between @entity3 and @entity12 and sectarian strife inside @entity3			1
@entity11 , also known as @entity35 , was killed wednesday by an " unknown group of men , " @entity12 said in a statement thursday			1
it is investigating the killing and hopes to " expose the perpetrators involved in this heinous crime			0
" @entity12 official @entity42 said @entity18 could be behind the attack			1
" because of the political and security vacuum on the ground , it will be for @entity18 's interest to take advantage and conduct something to that extent , " he said			0
" the only party benefiting is @entity18 by the assassination of @entity12 officials , " he said			1
but @entity18 defense minister @entity55 said , " it is possible that not only @entity18 was on the lookout for him			1
" " he was not one of the greatest saints of our generation , " he said			0
it is expected that @entity11 will be buried in @entity64 , @entity12 sources said			2
" the brother @entity35 served his lifetime devoting himself for the path of @entity69 in the ranks of the @entity12 , @entity12 , and in the service of the @entity7 cause and his people , " the group said			2
@entity12 , which controls the territory of @entity75 and opposes the existence of @entity18 , had long based its political wing in @entity9			2
but the movement 's senior officials decided to leave @entity3 as the 15 - month - long uprising against the @entity23 regime intensified , leaving a " security vacuum , " @entity12 ' @entity42 said			1
the @entity12 offices remain open in @entity9 , and lower - level officials -- some of whom have ties to @entity3 , such as family -- handle daily business , he said			2
@entity3 government officials and supporters have resented the forging of closer ties between @entity12 senior leaders and other regional rivals , such as @entity96 , which is supporting the anti-al - @entity23 opposition , and @entity64 , which has a peace treaty with @entity18			1
@entity12 leaders have discussed setting up its political wing in @entity64			2
@entity64 's @entity101 met with @entity103 chief @entity102 and his delegation on thursday to discuss a range of issues , @entity64 's state - run news agency @entity100 said			0
the @entity21 said the @entity111 " assassination " is the latest example of @entity3 - @entity7 sectarian violence fomented by the government			0
the pro-regime militia called @entity25 has been entering @entity7 refugee camps under the guise of " safeguarding the camps " but they " commit murder and engage in kidnapping , " the @entity21 said			0
it said the regime is recruiting " drug dealers , drug users , and other criminals " into the militia			0
the group said the @entity3 's " rejectionist policies " toward @entity18 " have only been attempts to enslave the people			1
" " the @entity7 experiences in the past demonstrate that the @entity3 regime views the @entity7 people as mere cards with which to gamble , regionally and internationally			0
a regime that kills its own people will not shy away from spilling @entity7 blood for the sake of its own survival , " the @entity21 said			0
some estimates say as many as 15,000 people have died in @entity3 in more than 15 months			0
@entity1 's @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
