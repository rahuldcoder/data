the 119 acres of @entity1 lie blanketed by the season 's first snowfall			1
a hush fills the air ; the only sound is the wind blowing accumulated snow , like confectioners ' sugar , off the branches of nearly bare trees			2
i enter through the gate on @entity15 and @entity16 , thinking back to a decidedly different day in late august			2
the sun was bright and hot for late summer			2
the verdant oaks and elms soared to the sky			2
i have written down the grave i am seeking : section 10 , @entity24 , @entity25			1
inside the cemetery office , i inquire how to find this particular grave in this vast space			1
an employee looks at the number scribbled in my reporter 's notebook			1
" i look at him , not knowing at first what to make of his reaction			2
from behind the counter , he whips out a photocopied flier			0
" you 're looking for @entity40 , right ? " i nod , yes , and glance at the flier			1
it 's a cemetery map			1
i see @entity40 's name and a hand - drawn line pointing to the lot where he is buried			1
the fliers became necessary because so many visitors asked the same question i did			1
several have already been here today , says the man behind the counter			0
i head down @entity53 to the intersection of @entity55 , just as the man instructed			0
i see why a marked map is necessary			0
there are rows and rows of graves			0
the sections are not marked , and the headstones are low and not that distinctive			1
i am searching for something that says his name : @entity40			1
such a common name , i think			0
how many @entity67 do i know ? at least six that i can recall in an instant			0
but i can not find him			0
i study the flier , fluttering in the frigid wind , and discern that he is somewhere between others whose names are marked on the map			0
then , i see the footprints , fresh on the snow			0
the rest of the field is pristine , but there has been a flurry of foot traffic here			1
i follow the footprints to a small bouquet of plastic flowers , red and purple , planted in the ground			0
there is not yet a headstone at @entity40 's grave			1
i stand where @entity40 's parents wailed as their son 's casket was lowered on august 25 into a copper vault			1
sixteen days before , he had been shot dead by @entity99 police officer @entity99			1
one minute , the 18 - year - old stood 6 feet 4			2
the next , he fell to the ground on @entity103			0
his blood colored the dull asphalt			0
he lay there for four hours			0
photos of his body on social media heightened the anger over a police officer 's killing of an unarmed black teenager			2
what # @entity99 stands for we all know what happened in the days and weeks afterward			1
what a contrast there is between those days and this one			0
a tale of two streets in @entity99 a black hearse carried @entity40 's gold and black casket through the streets of @entity129 on that late august day			1
a white horse - drawn wagon delivered him to his final resting place			2
a photograph taken after everyone was gone shows a spot in the field where grass was disturbed and the dirt turned and showered with a burst of red and white roses			0
now nothing remains but the plastic flowers			0
almost three long months have passed			1
it 's her @entity99 -- and it 's not all black and white what would @entity40 think if he could see what is happening in his name today ? perhaps he would approve of the demands for justice and calls for reform			1
but how would he feel about the violent protests ? about the way his hometown , just a few miles from here , waits with fear and anxiety for a grand jury decision ? his name was so ordinary			0
his headstone , i presume , will make it a tiny bit less so : @entity162			0
that 's what the copper vault said			2
but through death , his life turned out to be anything but ordinary			2
@entity162 's exit from this world unleashed a seething anger and sparked a new conversation about an age - old problem			1
some people believe him to be a thug who shoved the clerk at the @entity177 and then stole @entity179 cigars			0
some people believe he provoked @entity99 , the police officer			1
but those who make the pilgrimage to his grave site , i imagine , see him another way			1
as a loving son , a brother			0
or perhaps as a hero , a martyr of sorts			0
i wonder what else his headstone might say			0
standing at his grave , i feel the cold invade my bones			2
i get back in my rental car and leave the quiet of @entity1 to return to the storm of @entity99			1
follow @entity201 's @entity200 on @entity202 .			2

nearly three months have passed since @entity40 was laid to rest
fliers help visitors *navigate* the cemetery , where headstones are *indistinct*
those making the pilgrimage to his grave site do so for a variety of reasons
@entity40 's death in @entity99 sparked a new conversation about an age - old problem
