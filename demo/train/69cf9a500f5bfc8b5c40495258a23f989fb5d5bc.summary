-- @entity3 first became a world champion 16 years ago and , aged 46 , the @entity2 boxer made history in may when he was awarded a points victory over @entity8 @entity7 to become the sport 's oldest - ever holder of a global belt			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) light heavyweight champion surpassed the record held by compatriot @entity15 with his win in @entity17 , with @entity3 set to become the oldest pugilist to defend a world title if he defeats @entity20 on saturday			1
if @entity3 emerges victorious at the @entity22 in @entity23 it would mark the latest achievement in a career which has seen the veteran overcome adversity to reach the top of his sport			2
" i love what i do , " @entity3 told @entity0			2
" i love to work out , i love to win and i 'm going to take advantage of it until i ca n't do it no more			0
" it means a lot that i 'm in the history books again ... also it sets up for what comes next			0
obviously this saturday with @entity20 ... also becoming the second - oldest fighter to be fighter of the year			1
" unsurprisingly , @entity3 is significantly older than his opponent this weekend			2
@entity20 , currently ranked by @entity41 as the fourth - best light heavyweight in the world , is 29 , 17 - years younger than the @entity44 - born @entity3			1
" 29 - years - old , as we 've seen with @entity7 , as we 've seen with @entity46 , as we 've seen with most of the guys i 've fought that are younger than me at least by 15 years			2
" if it 's just age , if it 's just height			0
if it 's just things that have nothing to do with the iq ... that 's not enough to beat @entity3			2
" and i mean that			0
i mean that with confidence and i do n't mean that with just promoting			0
i mean that ... because of how i 've been disciplined over these years to train and live and think that way			0
" but despite his age , @entity3 will not be the oldest fighter on the card in @entity61 on saturday			1
that honor will belong to @entity63			2
the 52 - year - old cruiserweight who will be making his debut as a professional boxer in a four - round cruiserweight bout against @entity68 , no relation to @entity3 , but that is only half of his incredible story			1
@entity63 spent 26 years in @entity74 's @entity73 after being found guilty of murder in 1983 , before having his conviction overturned two years ago			1
during his incarceration , @entity63 focused on boxing an was even crowned the @entity73 heavyweight champion			1
his story is one which resonates with @entity3 , who served a five - year stretch in @entity82 , @entity44 between 1983 and 1988			1
so impressed was @entity3 with @entity63 that he has been training with the newcomer ahead of his much - anticipated fight			1
" it inspired me , " said @entity85			0
" he chose to do what he did , and not only did he get freedom , but he got humanity			0
an opportunity to do something that was taken from him years and years ago			1
to be on a major , major fight card			0
" and now that we became , i can say friends , and have understanding about that dark place that i put myself in , you know , i was n't innocent			0
but we still understand that dark place			0
everybody has a story , but his is beyond a story			0
