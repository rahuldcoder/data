@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 runs the @entity5 program which started in the @entity7 , but has branched out into working overseas			1
regarding sight as a fundamental human right that most people take for granted , the program aims to tackle a range of visual impairments that affect people across the world			0
@entity3 will be traveling to @entity1 and then @entity15 , taking volunteers to continue the work of @entity5			1
keep up with her experiences in her blogs and video diaries			0
november 8 , 2007 i have been developing and coordinating @entity5 's programs in @entity1 from the @entity7 since 2004 , so it has been a great privilege to finally arrive in @entity1 to meet the patient beneficiaries and the local @entity5 team			1
i have been spending much of my time with our ophthalmic team in @entity0			2
@entity29 and @entity30 are ophthalmic nurses and medical staff at the @entity33 , which is @entity5 's partner in @entity0			1
they are extraordinary people , working six days a week to provide eye care for patients living in extreme poverty , waking at dawn and working until sunset , often examining 150 patients per day			1
each day that i am with @entity29 and @entity30 in the villages , i marvel at their dedication and efficiency			1
having heard stories about them from our partner ophthalmologists and visiting volunteers , i knew that i would see their greatness in action while in @entity0 , but personally seeing their selfless dedication and commitment to unite for sight was even more extraordinary than i had anticipated			0
@entity5 vision screenings are held in very remote locations , where patients have no access to eye care			1
their health needs are beyond comprehension , as raw sewage often flows through the streets and running water is nonexistent			0
a small area is organized for the vision screening , which includes a series of screening stations			0
visiting @entity5 volunteers and local @entity1 translators work to register patients , identify their eye care needs and provide visual acuity screenings			1
then , the patients move into a very small , dark room where @entity29 and @entity30 are stationed to provide examination and diagnosis			1
they need to work in the dark so that they can see the back of each patient 's eyes			0
often more than 100 degrees ( @entity85 or @entity86 ) in the room , @entity29 and @entity30 rapidly examine each patient and determine whether they need medication , eyeglasses , consultation by ophthalmologist dr. @entity93 or surgery			2
if the patient needs medication or eyeglasses , they move to another station that is usually manned by local and visiting volunteers			0
if the patient needs surgery , @entity5 arranges for them to go to @entity33			2
living in extreme poverty , the patients can barely afford food , so they can not afford the price of surgery , which is usually $ 100			0
@entity5 sponsors their surgery to insure that no one remains blind because they ca n't pay			0
through september 2007 , @entity5 has coordinated and funded more than 1,200 sight - restoring cataract surgeries in the @entity0 , @entity1 region			2
the success of the program can largely be attributed to the remarkable work of @entity29 and @entity30 in the villages			2
it has been an extraordinary privilege to meet them and to see their work making such an impact			0

@entity3 has arrived in @entity1 and is spending time with the local @entity5 team
@entity29 and @entity30 are medical staff for a @entity5 partner there
@entity5 holds vision screenings in *adverse* conditions to bring eye care to @entity1
