eating a @entity2 diet may be your key to living longer			1
that 's according to a new study led by @entity7 , associate professor at @entity9 in @entity10 and @entity11			2
the diet involves eating items off a menu that is rich in vegetables , fruits , nuts , beans and peas , unrefined grains , olive oil and fish			2
it keeps dairy , meat and saturated fats to a minimum			0
and you can have a glass of red wine with dinner without cheating			0
can meditation really slow aging ? the diet has been consistently linked with health benefits that includes helping you manage your weight , and it can lower your risk for chronic issues such as cardiovascular disease			1
this new research looks at data from 4,676 healthy middle - aged women involved in the @entity43 , an ongoing study tracking the health of more than 120,000 @entity47 nurses since 1976			1
it found women who ate a @entity2 diet had longer telomeres			1
a @entity2 diet prevents strokes telomeres are part of your chromosomes , the thread - like structures that house your dna			1
at the end of these chromosomes are telomeres , a kind of protective " cap " that keeps the structure from unraveling			0
it thereby protects your genetic information			0
even in healthy people , telomeres shorten with age			0
shorter telomeres are associated with aging , lower life expectancy and age - related diseases such as artherosclerosis , certain cancers and liver disease			2
scientists have noticed some lifestyle choices such as smoking , being overweight or obese and drinking a lot of sugar sweetened drinks can prematurely shorten a person 's telomeres			0
scientists believe oxidative stress and inflammation can also shorten them			0
how to get super fit at any age fruits , vegetables , olive oils and nuts -- the key components of a @entity2 diet -- have well - known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects			1
the team of @entity47 researchers led by @entity100 therefore wanted to see whether the women who stuck with this diet had longer telomeres			2
" this is the largest population - based study addressing the association between mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy , middle aged women , " they write			1
the study included completed detailed food questionnaires and blood tests to measure telomere length			2
each participant had a calculated diet score ranging from 0 to 9 points ; a higher score signifies a closer resemblance to the @entity2 diet			1
each one point change in diet score corresponded an average of 1.5 years of telomere aging			2
telomere shortening is irreversible but healthy " lifestyle choices can help prevent accelerated shortening , " says @entity100			0
healthy aging , four keys this study 's results provide " some insight into the underlying physiologic mechanism behind this association , " indicating that greater adherence to this diet is significantly associated with longer telomeres , she says			1
because of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the @entity2 diet , following this diet " could balance out the ' bad effects ' of smoking and obesity , " @entity100 says			1
these findings further support " the health benefits of greater adherence to the @entity2 diet for reduction of overall mortality , increased longevity and reduced incidence of chronic diseases , especially major cardiovascular diseases			1
" none of the individual dietary components was associated with telomere length			0
researchers suggest that means the whole diet is an important element , rather than one item being a kind of superfood			0
that sweet drink may age you dr. @entity164 , a professor of @entity165 at @entity166 in @entity167 , who wrote an accompanying editorial , suggests that the variation in telomere length and dietary patterns may also be because of genetic background factors			0
while promising , @entity164 believes that future studies " should take into account the possibility of interactions between genes , diet and sex			0
" with these results , @entity100 and her research team hope in the future to figure out which components of the @entity2 diet may be having a bigger impact on telomere length			1
next they also hope to study the same thing in men .			0

study : women on a @entity2 diet had a key *biological* *marker* for slower aging
@entity2 diets have also been linked to lower cardiovascular *problems*
next scientists want to see if one particular food had a bigger impact
