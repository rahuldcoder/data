@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity4 's @entity3 vice president , disputes the government 's charges that he organized a death squad targeting government and military officials , saying the false claims are politically motivated and he has never and will never be involved in violence			1
" today it is @entity2 , tomorrow it will be someone else , " @entity2 told reporters tuesday in the northern @entity4 @entity14 city of @entity15 , where he discussed a warrant issued for his arrest by prime minister @entity20 's @entity19 - dominated government			1
@entity22 , the @entity3 - backed but cross-sectarian political bloc to which @entity2 belongs , has accused @entity20 of consolidating power , saying the @entity19 - backed political leader has refused to give up control of @entity4 's @entity28 ministries			1
" i have said there is a purpose behind this and there is political assassination and today there is a fabrication to embarrass this man after all he has done over the years and despite all the sacrifices made , " @entity2 said , referring to himself and his efforts to bring about political consensus in the diverse country during the @entity42 era			2
" after eight years i am rewarded with this			2
" the warrant issued for @entity2 's arrest is the latest in a series of events that have threatened to destroy @entity4 's fragile power - sharing agreement between @entity3 , @entity19 and @entity14 , raising fears about the stability of the country even as the last of @entity53 troops are withdrawn			1
the arrest warrant was issued just days after @entity22 suspended its participation in @entity56 amid claims it was being cut out of the political process			1
the charges appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men , identified as security guards for @entity2			2
@entity4 state - run tv aired video of the men 's confessions			1
@entity1 can not independently verify their identities			0
an official in @entity2 's office , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns , said the three men in the videotaped confessions were security guards for @entity2			2
the official said the men did not look distressed , though they believe they were under some sort of threat to make such confessions			0
among the confessions was one by a man who detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009			1
the person speaking said orders at times came directly from @entity2 and at times through his son - in - law , @entity89 , who is also a senior member of his staff			0
the man said the improvised explosive devices were produced and kept at an abandoned house belonging to @entity2 in the @entity94 neighborhood			0
he also alleged that the vice president personally thanked him after a number of attacks , and that he was rewarded $ 3,000 after the first @entity99 attack against a senior @entity101 official			1
the man in the video said @entity2 ordered him to map out security locations and checkpoints for the @entity106 , which protects the @entity107			0
he said he was speaking out to " clear his conscience " and " expose this criminal			0
" @entity110 said he had been warned to adopt certain political stances or the confessions would be aired			1
he said foreign political agendas and other countries moved this case against him but did n't elaborate			2
@entity22 members and others have said @entity20 is backed by @entity118			0
addressing reporters in the country 's @entity14 region , @entity2 indicated that the claims and the accusations that he engaged in these activities are absurd			1
he said the case should be transferred to the semi-autonomous @entity14 territory because of its neutrality			0
he also called for @entity130 observers and attorneys from the @entity134 lawyers @entity132 to guarantee the fairness of any proceeding			0
that 's because at present , he said , the country 's " judiciary has been politicized and lost its independence years ago and is controlled by the executive authority			2
" " i have big question marks over these confessions they made , " @entity2 said			0
" they can be easily disproved and refuted			0
but despite that , justice must take its course and everyone must resort to it , but on the condition that the requirements for justice are available			0
" " i am ready , along with my security guards , to stand in front of any judge as long as the basic requirements for justice are available , " he said			0
@entity110 questioned the legal procedure in the case and said airing confessions violates @entity4 law			1
he said federal court , and not the criminal courts , should handle charges against an @entity4 vice president			1
he also raised the issue of political immunity			2
@entity56 members have immunity and can not be prosecuted in crimes unless their immunity is lifted by the country 's @entity173			2
@entity110 questioned why he does n't have the same immunity			1
" it is strange that an investigation into various , complicated and old crimes committed over the years is concluded within 48 hours , " said the vice president			1
" this proves that the confessions were ready before the arrest of some of my security guards who are suspects ; they have worked with me over the past years with the utmost professionalism and no violation or acts punishable by the law were recorded against any of them			0
" when asked who is responsible , he said he directs " the blame ... to mr. @entity20			0
" since october , @entity4 security forces have rounded up hundreds of people accused of being members of @entity194 's outlawed @entity193 or terrorists			1
@entity22 says the majority of those people are members of its political bloc and that the prime minister is simply taking out his opponents			2
the political turmoil in @entity4 is raising concerns in @entity204 , with officials saying they are closely monitoring the reports about the arrest warrant			1
" we are talking to all of the parties			0
we 've expressed our concern regarding these developments			0
we 're urging all political sides in @entity4 to work out their differences peaceably , politically , through dialogue , and certainly in a manner that is consistent with democratic political processes and international standards of rule of law , " said @entity212 , a spokeswoman for the @entity213			1
ambassador @entity221 has been in contact with all of the parties in recent hours , she said monday			0
@entity110 left @entity0 monday for the @entity14 region for emergency talks with @entity19 vice president @entity226 and @entity4 president @entity227			1
the @entity228 said @entity2 has been banned from leaving the country			0
the vice president questioned statements from @entity53 president @entity232 , who recently said that @entity53 troops were leaving an @entity4 he described as democratic			1
he did n't understand if @entity232 is being misled or ignoring " the reality on the ground			0
" " i am a vice president addressing him today and my home is surrounded by tanks			1
what democracy are you talking about , mr. @entity232 ? " @entity1 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			2
