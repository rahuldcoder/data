" in the @entity7 , you have people who are delaying first marriages , and consequently there are lower rates of marriage and lower rates of divorce			1

" she did n't have a college degree when she got married , although she did eventually graduate from college and is now a teacher			2
@entity87 said she can see some reasons that @entity1 divorce at higher rates than the nation as a whole			1
" where i grew up in @entity82 , i saw some of my peers not finishing high school , some not going to college and some not finishing college , " she said			0

" youth and lack of education can lead to higher divorce rates , said @entity123 , a senior writer with the @entity124 , who wrote a report on " @entity126			1
" there 's also an interactive map on the website			0
" there tend to be higher divorce rates in states where women marry young , " @entity123 said			1
" education also may play a role			2
in general , less educated women marry at younger ages than college - educated women , and less educated couples have higher divorce rates			1
" values about premarital sex associated with the @entity2 and rural @entity51 may be encouraging people to marry early , at ages when they are likely to have less education and less income to support a long - lasting marriage , according to @entity146 , law professor at the @entity147 and co-author of " @entity149 : legal polarization and the @entity151			2

i would have divorced that guy			0
i had a much better idea of who i was ( when i married ) at 29 versus who i was at 19			0

" the very fact that people feel less pressure to get married ( in the @entity7 ) means they can be more selective about who they marry and take their time , " @entity201 said			2
" they do n't have to rush into it to please parents or avoid stigma of premarital sex			0
" whatever the reasons for the @entity1 's higher divorce rate , @entity229 author @entity228 said that church leaders are focusing more on divorce recovery when they should be focusing on preventing divorce			1
