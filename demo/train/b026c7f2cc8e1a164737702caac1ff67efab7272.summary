-- is @entity1 in a hurry to get 2012 over with ? probably not			2
but that did n't stop the snarky headlines after it was discovered that a buggy app in the new version of @entity1 's mobile operating system omits the month of december			1
the @entity10 app lets users bookmark friends ' birthdays and other important dates on a calendar			0
but some users of @entity17 4.2 , the system 's newest update , are complaining they ca n't note december dates in the app because its calendar skips from november to january			1
december simply does not exist			0
the @entity25 's reaction was swift			0
" is @entity1 the new @entity28 who stole @entity29 ? " posed @entity26 , a tech - news site			1
" sure , the month of december can be expensive and stressful , but @entity1 apparently has an app for avoiding it			1
" added @entity31 , " the new version of @entity17 thinks there are only 11 months in a year			0
" and @entity34 said the @entity17 bug " makes end - of - year birthdays even less bearable			0
" @entity1 posted a statement tuesday on the @entity17 page of @entity38 , its social network , vowing to fix the problem			1
it said : " we discovered a bug in the @entity17 4.2 update , which makes it impossible to enter december events in optional fields of the @entity10 app ( this bug did not affect calendar )			2
rest assured , this will be fixed soon so that those of you with december birthdays and anniversaries wo n't be forgotten by your friends and family			0
" android 4.2 is found on a handful of devices , including @entity1 's @entity62 phone and @entity64 tablet			1
