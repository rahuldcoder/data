@entity0 , @entity1 -- almost nothing stood			1
where the awful winds bore down , massive oaks , 100 years old , were shoved over like stems of grass , and great pines , as big around as 55 - gallon drums , snapped like sticks			1
church sanctuaries , built on the @entity12 , tumbled into random piles of brick			1
houses , echoing with the footfalls of generations , came apart , and blew away like paper			1
whole communities , carefully planned , splintered into chaos			1
restaurants and supermarkets , gas stations and corner stores , all disintegrated , glass storefronts scattered like diamonds on black asphalt			1
it was as if the very curve of the @entity31 was altered , horizons erased altogether , the landscape so ruined and unfamiliar that those who ran from this thing , some of them , could not find their way home			1
@entity38 : stories from the storm we are accustomed to storms , here where the cool air drifts south to collide with the warm , rising damp from the @entity46 , where black clouds roil and spin and unleash hell on @entity31			1
but this was different , a gothic monster off the scale of our experience and even our imagination , a thing of freakish size and power that tore through state after state and heart after @entity61 heart , killing hundreds , hurting thousands , even affecting , perhaps forever , how we look at the sky			1
but the same geography that left us in the path of this destruction also created , across generations , a way of life that would not come to pieces inside that storm , nailed together from old - fashioned things like human kindness , courage , utter selflessness , and , yes , defiance , even standing inside a roofless house			1
@entity38 : what stands in a storm : fellowship as @entity61 , we know that a man with a chainsaw is worth 10 with a clipboard , that there is no hurt in this world , even in the storm of the century , that can not be comforted with a casserole , and that faith , in the hereafter or in neighbors who help you through the here and now , can not be knocked down			1
i know this to be true because i came home to it the day after the storm			1
my street , a quarter - mile of small , historic homes and lovely trees , had looked as though it were painted on canvas and hung on the air			1
it was ruined april 27 , and also spared			1
no one died in @entity110 , while , yards away in @entity112 , rescue workers pulled the dead from houses blasted as if in war			1
it is why , even as they piled their neighborhood into trash heaps two stories tall , my neighbors said , over and over , how fortunate they were			1
our little white house , on the edge of a mile - wide tornado , was hammered by flying 2 - by - 4s , stripped of its shingles but , somehow , still standing when we returned from @entity126			1
my wife , @entity127 , cried when she saw it , and cried more as she looked down our street			1
a third of the houses were destroyed			1
others will be torn down			1
the trees that gave this place its name were gone or splintered			1
in our yard , a single , ancient dogwood survived , my wife 's pride , a reminder of what this used to be			1
people say it will never be the same			1
i do n't know about that			1
how do you leave ? it had been a bad spring			1
the sirens screamed every few days , in @entity150 , @entity1 and beyond			1
in @entity0 , just days before the big storm , @entity152 and her daughter , @entity153 , walked through the family house in @entity156 , looking for a place the 91 - year - old mrs. @entity152 could shelter when the weather turned			1
they settled on a hall closet , removed two @entity162 vacuum cleaners , silent since antiquity , and put in a chair			1
when sirens did sound on april 27 , mrs. @entity152 stepped inside and shut the door			1
she passed the time by looking through things , forgotten and dusty			1
she picked up a cookie tin , and pried off the lid			1
neatly rolled inside was her christening gown , the one she wore as a baby , almost 92 years ago			1
she had been looking for that			1
@entity38 : what stands in a storm : faith she is hard of hearing			2
inside , with her memories , she did not hear the destruction			2
she felt the house shake , but it had shaken before			2
then she heard someone calling her name			2
a neighbor , @entity184 , had huddled as the storm tore at his walls			2
the first thing he did , when it passed , was break into her house , damaged but intact , and shout for her			2
it was the same all along the street , as people ran from house to house , shouting , hoping			2
@entity184 called for her again			2
the closet door swung open			2
" well i am fine , @entity184 , " she said graciously , " and you are just so kind , to come check on me			2
" she stayed here because it was where she raised her children , where she once found a live horse in a bedroom , where every cardboard box bulged with history			1
it took the storm of a lifetime to move her			2
she walked through the ruin , and rode away			2
but she sent @entity153 back for the gown			2
there will be great - grandchildren to baptize			2
they must be properly dressed			2
outside , minutes after the winds died down , people gathered in the street			2
@entity221 , our boy took her daughter to prom , held a phone			2
" i see the @entity227 ... i see the @entity228 ... yes , mrs. @entity229 is fine			2
she 's on my arm			0
... " @entity231 and @entity232 had grabbed their wedding album and crawled into the tub			0
@entity227 had hidden with her triplets in a hallway as flying glass stabbed the walls			0
@entity240 had held to her big , white dog as her house disintegrated around her			0
then , one by one , people noticed the change			0
the once verdant place was laid open , stripped , flattened			0
you could see things you had never seen , like a water tower that used to be invisible behind the curtains of green			0
it was like the storm had picked these people up and set them down someplace ugly , broken , new			0
how awful it would have been , to have landed there alone			0
' i always thought we lived on a good street			0
now i know ' i have seldom felt helpless in my life			0
i hold to the hillbilly standard that there is no situation so hopeless that , through perseverance , i can not make worse			0
it is why my wife will not let me have a chainsaw -- " you will cut off your own head " -- and will not allow me on the roof			1
so there i stood , giant trees across my driveway , my roof naked , helpless			0
what happened next still seems like magic			0
within a minute of stepping into my yard , i was met by a never - ending stream of neighbors , some i only slightly knew , who left their own crises to help me clean up mine			0
there are too many to list here -- i would leave someone out -- but they came , capable men who knew how to run a saw or twist a wrench			0
some came , worked like a dog , and vanished before i could thank them			0
i hope they are reading this , men and women who lifted and dragged tons of trees , and almost killed me and my stepson @entity295 , trying to keep up			0
every church group in @entity0 , it seemed , clawed rubble out of my yard , or out of the playground across the street , meaning i can never again say anything mean about the @entity301			1
i came to enjoy the company			0
that first afternoon , i straightened up from tugging on an unmoving limb to see @entity304 , the husband of my son 's music teacher , saw through a tree that blocked my drive			0
he brought his father , @entity311 , and an old , brown dog named @entity313 , and we told duck hunting stories and i do n't think any lies , but it was hard to tell over the roar of the saws			0
and then they , too , were gone , to help someone else , somewhere down the road			0
@entity38 : what stands in a storm : food there was no end to this generosity			0
no one would take a dime			0
the college students on our street , the ones i had yelled at for driving too fast , cooked all the meat from our melting freezers , and let me pet their puppy			0
mrs. @entity152 's @entity153 asked if we needed a generator			0
our boy 's friends brought gasoline			0
folks with gas water heaters offered hot showers			0
that night , i went to sleep under the luxury of an electric fan			0
the next morning , my neighbors were in my yard before i was			0
if a street is made of people , not oaks and tulip trees , how can this place not be as fine as it ever was ? i think the best i heard it put was by @entity227			0
" i always thought we lived on a good street , " she said			0
" a few days after the storm , on a sunday morning , i awoke to a tap - tap - tap on my roof			0
i should have gone to see what it was about , but after a while the rhythmic tapping got to be almost soothing , and i ducked inside a dream			0
later , i learned that my neighbor @entity365 had scaled the roof and tacked down some covering that had blown loose			1
he did not ask me where i went to church , or how i voted , or who my family was			0
he did not climb that ladder for money , or attention , or even thanks			0
he did it , he said , because it looked like rain			0
