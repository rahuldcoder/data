-- cricket has been hit by another tragedy in the same week @entity4 test star @entity3 died as result as a result of injuries he received after being struck by a ball in a match in @entity10			1
@entity11 , 60 , a former captain of the @entity14 national team , was umpiring a match saturday in his home town of @entity17 when he received an apparently fatal blow in a freak accident			1
before the match between @entity23 and @entity24 , the final game of the @entity14 domestic season , players and officials had held a minute 's silence for @entity3 , whose untimely death has led to a string of tributes across the world			1
@entity24 was also to be given the championship trophy at the end of the match , but as @entity35 , the deputy chairman of the @entity14 @entity36 told @entity0 , that celebration was never to happen			1
@entity35 was not at the match , but recounted what he had been told of the tragic incident			0
" @entity43 through the first innings a ball was driven fiercely back towards the umpire ( by the batsman )			2
" it hit the stumps and ricocheted but as @entity11 tried to move out of the way the ball followed him and he was hit in the chest or just under the chin , it is still unclear exactly where			1
" he collapsed immediately and according to witnesses who were there he may have had a heart attack			0
" @entity35 said that the umpire was resuscitated by ambulance staff who were quickly on the scene , but he died later at a hospital in @entity17			2
@entity62 @entity35 , 51 , said the @entity14 cricketing community had been left stunned by the incident			2
" @entity65 was much loved by everyone , " he said the @entity68 's ceo , @entity67 , paid his tribute on its official @entity71 page			0

unlike in sports such as baseball , cricket umpires are unprotected and do not wear helmets , despite the high speeds which the ball can be struck by batsman			2
but fatal incidents involving either players or umpires are extremely rare			0
an umpire at a match in @entity100 was killed five years ago after a ball thrown by a fielder hit him on the head			1
in the light of the recent accident , @entity35 said that " maybe there was need " for umpires to wear helmets			0
unlike @entity4 , @entity14 is not considered a major cricketing power , but there are several thousand active participants at all levels , with an 18 - strong national league			1
most of the adult players were originally born , like @entity11 , in traditional cricket playing countries such as @entity118 , where it is the national sport .			1
