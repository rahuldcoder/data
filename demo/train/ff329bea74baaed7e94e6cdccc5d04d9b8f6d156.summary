-- as the mosque debate dominates the summer spin cycle , a new @entity1 shows that an increasing number of @entity5 believe that @entity6 is a @entity7 -- now up to 18 percent from 11 percent in march 2009			1
at the same time , only a third of @entity5 say @entity6 is a @entity9 , down from nearly 50 percent last year			1
and while the biggest jumps in believing @entity6 is muslim come from self - described conservative @entity12 -- from 18 percent to 34 percent -- the number of @entity14 who describe @entity6 as @entity9 fell from 55 percent to 46 percent			1
independents -- while being the group least likely to want professions of religious beliefs from politicians -- have also fallen in with the drift			0
i believe the @entity5 people are smart			1
so what can account for this slippage from common sense to conspiracy theory ? @entity6 made the story of his increasing commitment to @entity30 a central tenet of his campaign character narrative ; whole chapters were devoted to matters of faith in his book " @entity37			2
" but in the radioactive wake of the rev. @entity39 , @entity6 left his longstanding church and has not yet found a new congregation			1
the absence of @entity6 attending sunday services regularly has been a repeated " just askin ' ... " talking point on right wing news and radio -- and indeed , the @entity1 poll shows that most respondents got their " views " about @entity6 's religion from " the media			1
" the meticulous attention that some liberals paid to @entity55 's golf game is now directed at @entity6 hitting the links -- with the added subtext that he 's playing when he should be praying			2
in the eyes of his opponents , @entity6 is an elitist silently laughing at those bitter @entity5 who cling to their guns and religion			1
the fact that an icon of the religious right like @entity66 rarely attended sunday services is ignored			0
but these poll numbers are also an ugly proxy for the campaign to convince the @entity5 people that their president is somehow " other " -- an " alien in the @entity71 , " as a @entity73 editorial page headline called him recently			2
the birther myths build off this sense of @entity6 as a sinister fraud , casting @entity6 as not just anti-american in his beliefs but actually un-american and therefore not constitutionally eligible to be president			0
these conspiracy theories in turn build off chain e-mails that have been circulating since at least 2008 , portraying @entity6 as a @entity84 determined to undermine the @entity85 from within -- a fright wing fantasy that has proliferated via the internet			0
depressingly , a @entity0 poll earlier this month found that 27 percent of all @entity5 believe that @entity6 was either definitely or probably not born in the @entity5 -- a belief shared by 41 percent of @entity12			1
" everyone is entitled to their own opinion , " the late sen. @entity90 famously said , " but not their own facts			0
" but the rise of partisan media means that @entity5 are self - segregating themselves into separate political realities where we ca n't even agree on basic facts like the president 's religion and birthplace			2
while no responsible @entity12 would ever explicitly encourage these beliefs , there are plenty who delight in these poll findings because it presumably points to partisan gain			0
truth is not as important as the pursuit of power in professional partisans ' eyes , and dividing to conquer is a time - honored trick			0
each president since at least @entity116 has faced a concerted effort to de-legitimize the duly elected president of the opposing party from day one			0
but with @entity6 , the fact that he is the first @entity122 - @entity5 president with a middle name @entity124 has led to a new level of ugliness and suspicion			1
attacks that demonize the president are poisoning the civic well from which we all drink			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			0

@entity133 says @entity1 poll found 18 percent of @entity5 believe @entity6 is @entity7
the *misconception* ranges across political *spectrum* . why is this happening , he asks ?
political opponents are smart enough to know the truth , but like the *controversy* , he says
