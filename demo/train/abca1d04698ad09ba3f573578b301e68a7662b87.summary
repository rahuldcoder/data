-- as the head of world soccer , @entity1 has been trying hard to address the problem of racism in football since infamously telling @entity0 in 2011 that instances of it on the pitch could with solved " with a handshake			1
" now , however , he is facing calls to quit as @entity13 president following comments on friday which have led to accusations that he has gone soft on fighting the issue			1
" @entity1 is erratic , his behavior is erratic , his declarations are erratic			1
it 's completely unacceptable , what he said , " @entity20 of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) group told @entity0 friday			2
after supporting @entity23 , who walked off in protest after being racially abused during a friendly match in january , @entity1 last month invited the @entity27 player to join the ruling body 's new anti-racism taskforce			1
but the 77 - year - old appeared to have taken a big step backwards with his comments on friday , casting doubt on his previous statements that offending clubs should face points deductions or even be relegated			1
" can we bring an end to violence or racism by docking points or relegating a team ? or would such measures lead people to come to games to get the match abandoned , " @entity1 said in a speech at a meeting of the company @entity45 , with which @entity13 works in its fight against match - fixing			1
" we should do all we can but there 's a risk that if we have matches replayed or if we punish clubs on the sporting front , it will open the door to hooligan groups who will come to deliberately cause trouble			2
" @entity13 confirmed to @entity0 that the quotes were correct , but insisted that @entity1 had not reversed his position on punishments for racism -- and that the comments merely raised the challenges faced in implementing such penalties			1
" today he reiterated the need for punishment that hits hard against any form of racism , " a spokesperson from @entity13 's media department said			1
" he underlined that fines achieve little , but points deductions and exclusion from competitions would be effective measures			0
he also stressed that prevention must go hand in hand with punishment			0
" he acknowledged that the implementation of these sanctions might pose some challenges , such as a potential risk that the system could be abused by some spectators for the only purpose of getting a very unfair advantage for their team			0
" such issues will be carefully examined and will in no way alter the @entity13 president 's very strong commitment towards the eradication of the racism scourge from football and his zero tolerance towards any form of racism			1
" @entity20 's call for @entity1 to resign -- and thus end a reign that began in 1998 -- was supported by others on online social media			1
" @entity1 just gave every racist in football a licence to abuse			1
even by his standards this is utterly outrageous , " @entity0 's @entity107 wrote on @entity108 , adding to the # @entity110 hashtag			2
@entity20 said @entity1 is out of touch with the realities of the game			2
" maybe it would be good for @entity1 to spend some time outside of fancy meetings , " he said			2
" he would understand a lot more if he would come and see a game , see what is happening during the games and see what happens when you take the right measures			0
" ( what he said ) makes absolutely no sense and goes against all our experience			0
" @entity21 works closely with @entity130 soccer 's ruling body @entity128 , monitoring crowds at matches and reporting any racist behavior that its staff witness			2
@entity128 has been criticized for what is seen as relatively light punishments for racist offenses , but has come down harder on offending clubs this season			0
@entity141 's @entity140 has been punished on four occasions due to misbehavior by its fans			2
" i have great confidence in @entity128 , " @entity20 said			0
" @entity128 proved time and time again that they know what to do and they did the right thing			0
with @entity13 i do n't have that			2
@entity1 is erratic and i think it 's time for him to resign			1
" on friday , the @entity152 football federation banned @entity153 for five club matches and fined the @entity156 midfielder 1,000 euros ( $ 1,300 ) following his @entity158 - style goal celebration last month			0
the ban is largely symbolic as the 20 - year - old had already been suspended for the rest of this season by his club , and the federation had earlier banned him for life from representing his country			0
also on friday , @entity13 confirmed that @entity167 will not be completely ready to host june 's @entity168 -- a precursor event to next year 's @entity170 in the @entity172 country			1
" it will be a fantastic tournament -- but not all operational arrangements will be 100 % " secretary general @entity176 wrote in his monthly column on the @entity13 website , on the same day of the inauguration of the third of the tournament 's six host stadiums at the @entity183 in @entity184			1
he said work on venues in @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 ( the redeveloped @entity190 ) is due to be completed by the end of this month			0
there will be 12 grounds used at the 32 - team @entity170 , which will host 64 matches -- four times that of the eight - nation @entity168			0
" it is impossible to expect this to happen in the shortened preparation time -- in most cases , less than two months instead of the scheduled six -- due to the compromises we made with the cities , " @entity176 said			0
" i want to reiterate : this will be impossible to repeat for the @entity170 , and has been acknowledged by the federal government and @entity204 the deadline for the @entity170 stadiums delivery stands firm as december 2013			0
there will be no compromise			0
