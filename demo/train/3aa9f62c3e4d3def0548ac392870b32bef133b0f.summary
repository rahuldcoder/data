@entity0 -- @entity3 propagandist @entity2 had a long plane ride last week to @entity0 and an @entity6 jail cell located blocks from ground zero of the september 11 attacks			1
he filled that time , in part , by talking to @entity6 investigators			2
it was an odd end to a journey that began just weeks earlier in @entity14			2
@entity2 , for reasons still unclear , left @entity14 and entered @entity16 using a forged @entity19 passport , @entity16 media reported			1
the @entity20 tracked him to a @entity16 hotel room			0
he was detained by @entity16 officials in early february , but they refused for a month to turn him over to the @entity6 instead , @entity16 expelled @entity2 and put him on a plane to @entity25 , where he was born , sources said			1
@entity6 law enforcement took him into custody during a stopover in @entity29			2
members of @entity31 -- the @entity31 , which includes the @entity20 -- were also involved in the operation			0
@entity2 apparently was n't quiet during his overseas flight with @entity6 authorities			1
the conversations , confirmed by a @entity6 official with knowledge of them , are expected to be part of the government 's case to prove @entity2 helped conspire to kill @entity6 and recruited members for @entity3			1
the @entity43 and @entity44 declined to comment on whether or when @entity2 was read his miranda rights after his arrest			2
however , intelligence experts say that is required if prosecutors intend to use his lengthy statement during trial			0
" that would be the way it was done , " says @entity51 , an executive managing director with the security firm @entity52 and the @entity54 's former director of intelligence analysis			0
sources and intelligence experts told @entity1 it 's questionable how helpful @entity2 , one of @entity63 's sons - in - law , could be in terms of current intelligence , because he has been out of the loop for years			2
he has lived in @entity14 since 2002 , mostly under house arrest			2
" he 's a low - level target with high political value , " @entity51 told @entity1			0
" his main value would be ( if he 's ) able to help quantify and assess the former top @entity3 leaders with him under house arrest in @entity14 , " @entity51 says			1
@entity51 added the @entity6 would want @entity2 to " describe the nature of the @entity14 treatment of them , " including " how adversarial the relationship is between @entity14 and @entity3			1
" there is concern former @entity3 leaders in @entity14 could rise to power again			1
but the relationship between the predominantly @entity82 @entity14 and the largely @entity84 members is a complex one			0
just how do the @entity14 view @entity3 ? do they see opportunities for cooperation ? or is the extreme @entity84 philosophy of the group too much for them ? it 's something investigators would like to know , and @entity2 may have insights			1
strange bedfellows -- @entity14 and @entity3 on friday , the fiery former @entity3 spokesman walked into federal court with his hands cuffed			1
he was only about a mile from ground zero in the very country he had targeted in multiple video messages , warning @entity6 they would be attacked again after 9/11 by " airplane storms " and biochemical attacks			0
at his arraignment , his cuffs now removed , a not guilty plea was entered on @entity2 's behalf by @entity108 , the attorney appointed to represent him			1
@entity2 told the court , through an @entity111 interpreter , he had no money to pay for a lawyer			0
prosecutors did n't reveal what @entity2 had said to them , only telling the court he had made an " extensive statement " after his arrest that filled 22 pages			1
the charges in the indictment were sealed until his arrest			0
he is being held without bond until his next appearance in april			0
no trial date has been set			0
if found guilty , @entity2 faces life in prison .			0

@entity2 's statement , given after his arrest , is 22 pages long
expert says his value comes in assessing status of former @entity3 leaders in @entity14
concern is @entity3 could gain power in @entity14 again
@entity139 is charged with conspiracy to kill @entity6
