-- it was a classic match on tennis ' grandest stage -- @entity4 upended @entity5 9 - 7 in the third set at @entity7 last year to reach her first grand slam final			1
but instead of being asked about turning points , forehands or backhands , the first three questions posed to @entity5 in the post-match press conference seemed to focus on the handshake			1
the reason ? @entity5 , a @entity17 , merely stuck out a hand and did n't look at @entity4 , the @entity19 with @entity21 roots			1
she was more preoccupied with getting to her chair and off @entity23			0
it reeked of bad sportsmanship , hardly a fitting farewell given the battle that had unfolded for nearly two - and - half hours			0
" what could i do , just be there and dance ? " @entity5 said			1
" i did n't feel like it at that point			1
" the handshake took up much of the post-match buzz , with tennis legend @entity35 and retired grand slam champion @entity36 heavily criticizing the usually adored @entity5			1
" i could n't believe it , " @entity35 said in her role as a pundit for the @entity39			1
" i have never not looked my opponent in the eye after a match			0
" @entity44 , the former top - five player and ex coach of @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , added in an interview with @entity0 : " that was definitely two people , two taxis			0
" tennis fans , journalists and even players will tell you they keep an eye on the handshake , especially when something contentious happens during the match			1
the handshake is mostly picked up by cameras -- and when it 's not viewers are n't happy			1
in team sports such as football and @entity66 , post-game handshakes and high fives do n't command as much attention			1
" we viewers invest two , three or more hours following the highs and lows of the two individuals involved , " @entity72 , a longtime @entity73 tennis journalist and broadcaster , wrote in his blog for @entity76 last year			1
" the handshake , and the walk up to the handshake , is an integral part of a tennis match			1
it 's the joy of victory and the agony of defeat , it 's all the emotions of the competitors summed up in a final ritual gesture			2
and we want to see it all -- uninterrupted			0
" the handshake is n't mandatory but it 's extremely rare for players not to partake in the ritual			1
one such occasion happened two years ago at the @entity97 , when 2010 @entity7 finalist @entity98 snubbed @entity100 @entity99			1
@entity98 felt @entity99 purposely struck him with a forehand , a claim the latter denied			0
@entity98 was loudly booed when he left the court			2
@entity105 , the 2013 @entity7 champion , refused to shake hands with @entity108 compatriot @entity107 at @entity109 in 2009 after @entity107 accused her of gamesmanship			1
@entity47 told @entity0 the lack of a handshake in the @entity98 - @entity99 tie made for entertainment			2
some would say what happened between @entity117 's @entity116 and @entity98 's fellow @entity118 , @entity119 , in the @entity120 in 2012 could be classified as entertainment , too			2
@entity116 claimed @entity119 gave him the middle finger during the handshake			2
most of the time @entity47 's handshake does n't waiver			1
" when you 're on court , it 's a confrontation , a battle in a way , " said @entity47			2
" during certain matches players will earn your respect regardless of whether it 's @entity135 ( @entity136 ) , who is a great player , or someone that 's ranked lower ; if they play a great match against you or it 's a young player that you think is really good			1
" last year at the @entity97 , @entity136 appeared to swear at @entity47 during a five - set defeat but the @entity143 did n't think of not shaking hands			1
( imagine the boos that would have rained down then			0
) " there are certain things that happen in matches that when the match is done it does n't necessarily influence how you feel about that person , " said @entity47			2
" things in the heat of the moment , you understand that things can be said			0
" sometimes it 's literally two minutes for you to cool down after something like that happens			2
sometimes it can take weeks or months before that relationship is resolved			0
" i 've not really had a problem with anyone once i 'd finished the match			0
" @entity170 , twice a grand slam semifinalist and the man who held the record for most consecutive majors played in the @entity171 prior to @entity136 , liked to send a message with his handshake			2
" win or lose , i gave the guy the hardest handshake i could , " the retired @entity174 told @entity0			2
" if i lost i gave him a hard handshake to tell him i 'd be back the next time and if i won , to show him i was strong and played well			2
" so for me i think it 's important to show some strength in your handshake			1
if you go up and you 've lost and you put a bad effort in the handshake it shows bad character			0
" the @entity190 could n't shed light on the origin of tennis handshakes			1
but it 's known for certain that over the years , the type of handshake has changed , going from the traditional shake to the arm - wrestle or cup			1
" there were a few handshakes early on but now it has just gone to the cups , " @entity200 , a former doubles no. 1 whose 19 - year career comes to an end at @entity7 , told @entity0			0
" i think the cup is a little more personal			0
" before you would cup with your friends and do the handshake with the guys you 're not that friendly with			0
now it 's just the cup all around			0
" where did the ' cup ' come from ? @entity212 , a top - three player in both singles and doubles as part of a career that spanned the 1970s , 80s and 90s , recalled that @entity219 's @entity218 was among the first female players to employ the " arm - wrestle " shake			1
now , players even hug at the net , with @entity224 seemingly a particular fan of the hug			0
he once swapped shirts with an opponent football style -- @entity229 -- post match at the net			0
" the game is getting so much more physical , " said tennis historian and journalist @entity232			0
" it could be headed for more hugs			0
" @entity212 and @entity35 give the edge to the men when it comes to the better handshakes			0
" we had plenty of cold handshakes in our day , men and women , " said @entity212			0
" in fact i think women led by @entity248 ( @entity249 ) and @entity35 may have done it better than the @entity251 ( @entity252 ) , @entity253 ( @entity254 ) and @entity229 ( @entity256 ) era			0
today the men are leading the way in genuine sportsmanship			0
all the top men set a great example			0
" but the cold handshakes -- and the chatter they create -- probably wo n't ever disappear .			1

handshakes in tennis *captivate* *onlookers* , especially when it 's a contentious one
@entity5 *famously* snubbed @entity4 at @entity270
