-- your saliva is doing all kinds of useful things for you all the time -- for instance , helping you chew and taste food			1
it 's also home to more than 600 species of bacteria , which are harmlessly enjoying the moisture of your mouth			1
there 's a slew of bacteria floating around in your mouth , but it 's generally harmless			1
since people have different eating habits in different places , you might think an @entity21 's saliva might look a lot different from , say , a @entity22 's			1
but a new study published in the journal @entity25 finds that bacteria in saliva may not be as related to environment and diet as you might think			1
in fact , researchers found that the human salivary microbiome -- that is , the community of bacteria in saliva -- does not vary greatly between different geographic locations			1
that means your saliva is just as different from your neighbor 's as someone 's on the other side of the planet			2
" it was somewhat surprising to us , because in our sampling we did n't control for diet , or environment , or anything like that , " said @entity42 of the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , and co-author of the study			0
now , @entity42 and colleagues are trying to figure out why			0
one theory is that since the researchers looked only at the genus of the bacteria in question , they might find more differences at the level of individual species			2
they are investigating this in a follow - up study			0
@entity42 became interested in surveying the bacteria of saliva when he learned that saliva contains more dna than blood , if you include dna of bacteria and other organisms			1
human blood , as you might guess , still contains more human dna than saliva			1
researchers took saliva samples from a total of 120 healthy subjects			2
the countries represented in this sample were @entity45 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity22 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity21			0
this was the first global survey of bacteria diversity in human saliva			1
the most common type of bacteria found in the survey of saliva was @entity102 , @entity42 said			1
people typically have @entity102 in their mouths living benignly , although certain species are responsible for diseases such as strep throat , meningitis and bacterial pneumonia			1
why do you need hundreds of bacteria species in your mouth ? it turns out they 're mostly not helping you at all -- you 're just giving them a warm , moist home			2
" having those bacteria -- that 's the price we have to pay for having a lot of saliva in the mouth to begin with , " said @entity117 , anthropologist at the @entity118 , @entity118			1
@entity117 , who has studied enzymes in saliva , found the results surprising , and said no one had previously surveyed the variety of bacteria in saliva			1
what else is inside saliva ? one component of saliva that has been shown to vary according to diet is amylase , the only digestive enzyme that converts starch into sugar , @entity117 said			2
@entity141 is also found in the pancreas and the small intestine			0
the human body evolved to start the digestive process early , in the mouth , so we can maximize the amount of sugar that we take in , @entity117 said			0
" given that we have such large brains , and our brains are metabolically very demanding tissues , they 're extremely costly and expensive to maintain , so we need a lot of sugar , " he said			0
@entity21 in particular have a lot of amylase in their saliva because their diets are full of starch : chips , rice and baked potatoes			2
but the @entity165 of @entity166 , for example , eat mostly game animals , honey and fruit			0
they have relatively little amylase in their saliva			2
@entity117 and colleagues found these differences at the genetic level , meaning natural selection has favored large quantities of amylase in populations with starchy diets			0
but there is also evidence that amylase levels can rise and fall within an individual 's lifetime			0
a study on college students in @entity187 , who typically eat a lot of meat at the university , found that students who had grown up eating traditional starchy @entity187 home - cooked meals had lower levels of amylase after attending the school			0
humans have had starch as an important part of their diet for at least 12,000 years , since the advent of agriculture , he said			0
so what else is spit good for ? saliva spreads molecules to the taste receptors on the tongue so you can tell whether something is salty , sour , sweet or spicy , @entity117 said			1
it also helps soften food and spread it to your teeth so that you do n't have to chew as hard			0
compared with other animals , humans are not very good at detecting toxins , he said			0
as a result , humans vomit much more than other species , and saliva buffers the acid that results from throwing up -- meaning you 'll likely salivate immediately beforehand to limit the damage			2
" a lot of the value of saliva is attributable to the fact that , in human evolution , we 've had to eat marginal plant foods , things that are marginal in quality and full of toxins , and we need these particular salivary adaptations to help cope with those types of food , " he said .			0

saliva contains more dna than blood because of all of the oral bacteria
most common type of bacteria in saliva is @entity102 , in a mostly harmless form
