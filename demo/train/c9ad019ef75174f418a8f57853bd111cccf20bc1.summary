-- the clock is ticking as the december 31 deadline approaches for @entity3 and president @entity4 to come to some sort of agreement over the infamous fiscal cliff			1
but what happens when the country finally reaches the fiscal edge ? tax increases for everyone ? deep spending cuts ? another recession ? as president @entity4 puts pressure on @entity17 to come to a compromise over the fiscal cliff , it seems like everyone wants to know : what is the best solution ? adults often have to make compromises to make ends meet financially			1
@entity26 invited people to share their stories of financial compromise , and what advice they would give to @entity3 on the fiscal cliff based on the lessons they 've learned			1
use cash , not credit a couple years back , @entity36 found herself in a financial conundrum			2
as a single mother , she said immediate needs such as bills , food and gas would pile up , so she started putting a lot of her expenses on credit			2
" and when i could not pay off my credit cards , i would go to the bank and get a loan to pay them off , " she said			2
" it was a terrible cycle			2
" she was finally able to break the cycle with help from a financially savvy friend who helped limit her credit usage			2
" she only worked with cash and she helped me create a budget , " she said			2
credit cards " are so dangerous			0
we are paying so much interest			0
you think you have all this money , but it is not your own			1
" since that time , @entity63 has gotten married and she and her husband own three small businesses in @entity67			0
they made a pledge to not use credit cards after they nearly lost their home to foreclosure during the recession four years ago			0
" we only use cash , " she said			0
@entity36 , 58 , believes the president and @entity3 could learn something from her journey to free herself of credit card debt			1
" i definitely feel like our nation 's reliance on credit has put us in this fiscal cliff crisis , " she said			1
she advised @entity3 to " hold fast and push for spending cuts as well as balancing the budget in combination with increasing revenue in whatever way makes sense , " she advised			1
learning to prioritize spending is something she says was a tough , but an invaluable lesson			0
" my life has improved tremendously and i attribute much of it to getting my finances straightened out , " she said			1
" we 've had our own financial hiccups with the recession , and each time we apply the same principles and we are back on our feet , even when things were out of our control			0
" @entity103 ... about taxes ? 2			2
take responsibility for your actions the optimist within 34 - year - old @entity109 believes @entity3 and the president will come to an agreement over the fiscal cliff			1
the associate professor at @entity115 's @entity114 said past incidents such as @entity118 downgrading of the @entity120 credit rating should serve as a reminder that there are consequences to not reaching a financial resolution			1
" i have to take responsibility for my actions , " she said when reflecting on her finances , and she said @entity3 should do the same			1
owning up to financial responsibility is a life lesson she tried to keep in mind when purchasing a home with her husband last year			0
" we decided not to let our future incomes dictate the amount of mortgage , " she said			0

not one or the other			0
stop wasting like many people , @entity155 said when finances get tight , frivolous spending goes out the window			1

the @entity167 , @entity168 , resident and recent college graduate knows what it is like to work with a strict budget , especially since he is still looking for full - time employment			2
cutting back on wasteful spending is a lesson he said @entity3 needs to learn			1
he said he was frustrated when he read a financial report back in 2011 about the @entity181 spending $ 16 a piece on muffins and other exuberant amounts of money on lavish business lunches			2
" in this economy , it is somewhat shocking to me that people are willing to spend that amount of money when it clearly is n't necessary , " the 29 - year - old said			2
@entity155 does not believe @entity3 and the president will come to an agreement on the fiscal cliff before the december 31 deadline			1
" in recent years , when facing budget deadlines , the only agreement made is to extend the deadline , " he said			0
he blames this on the stubbornness of politicians and their unwillingness to compromise , which worries him if taxes were to rise as a result of the fiscal cliff crisis			1
" i imagine i would need to look for two jobs instead of one so that i could pay off debt incurred during college , pay my bills , and survive , " he said			0
his advice for @entity3 is simple : stop wasteful spending			1
for starters , he suggests that @entity3 could try hosting a potluck working lunch next time			1

" i do n't drive a @entity256 , even though i could afford one			0
" the @entity230 resident believes @entity3 should apply the same philosophy when it comes to the fiscal cliff			1
" too often i feel our government tries to appease everyone , which clearly ca n't happen , " he said			0
he said the best advice he could give @entity3 is to not delay the process any longer			1

learn to live with less a few years ago , @entity269 and her husband retired from teaching			2
now at the age of 61 , @entity269 is working again in order to pay for rising health care costs			2
