-- @entity1 is making some noise about its future plans			1
@entity1 aims to eventually expand its internet radio service to other countries and move into areas beyond music , such as news , talk and sports			1
the long - term goals , along with illuminating details about the company 's financials and adoption rates , were outlined in a proposal for an initial public offering filed on friday			0
the service , currently focused exclusively on music , is all about catering to each listener 's unique tastes			0
after signing up for an account , users can type in the names of favorite bands , and @entity1 will create a customized radio station that spins similar songs			1
but there are limitations , such as the number of tracks by a single musician that can be played during a set period			0
while @entity1 suggested that music will remain its core focus , the new filing shows that the company is looking to other areas for growth			1
" many radio listeners are drawn to sports , talk , news and other forms of content beyond music , " the company wrote			1
" we think there is an opportunity over the long term to offer these types of content in addition to music			0
" @entity1 founder @entity53 named these as possible areas the service could cover in the future , he said in a little - seen video posted in august 2009			2
offering news , talk and sports content is " something that we 've talked quite a bit about as a company and something we intend to deliver to listeners eventually , " @entity53 said			1
not surprisingly , the service would personalize programming for each person			0
in this case , the zip code tied to your account or information from your phone 's @entity73 could trigger the service to provide local news or updates about a hometown sports team			1
" i think one of the very interesting things about doing that in an internet radio is we actually will know something about where you are , " he said			0
" so we 'll be able to deliver sports , weather , news that 's actually relevant to your particular area			2
" opening the service up to regions outside the @entity95 is another long - term goal , the company said			0
@entity97 , another streaming music service that has a radio personalization component , has quickly dominated in the areas of @entity101 that it operates in			0
the company is planning a @entity95 expansion , which it projects will launch in " coming months			0
" while @entity97 already has a tight - knit relationship with @entity101 's music executives and has spent the last couple of years entrenched in negotiations with @entity95 publishers and labels , @entity1 's ties to the industry are n't as tight			2
@entity1 licenses the more than 800,000 tracks it has rights to play from a government agency , not directly from publishers			2
in @entity1 's ipo proposal , the company also included statistics about its rise			1
more than 80 million people have registered to use the service			1
on average , a user has created 17.5 stations , logged feedback in the form of 100 thumbs up or down song ratings , and listens to more than 10 hours per month			0
@entity1 generates much of its revenue from advertising but has yet to turn a profit .			2

@entity1 plans to eventually launch in other counties and offer sports , talk and news
this information , along with illuminating stats , was included in an ipo filing
@entity1 has 80 million registered listeners
