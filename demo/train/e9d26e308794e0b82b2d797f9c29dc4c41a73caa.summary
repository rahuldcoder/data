@entity0 -- four jurors in the @entity4 wrongful death trial said they feel cheated by the outcome , which they blame on a misleading verdict form			1
the six - month - long trial ended in october with a victory for @entity9 , the concert promoter @entity4 's mother and children had claimed was liable for his death because it hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death			1
the jurors , whose sworn statements were attached to a motion for a new trial filed thursday by @entity21 's lawyers , said most of the jury wanted to find concert promoter @entity9 liable in @entity4 's 2009 death			1
along with arguing that the verdict form was faulty , the @entity4 lawyers contend the judge erred by refusing to let them pursue a negligence claim independent of the hiring case			1
@entity9 not liable in @entity4 's death , jury finds @entity4 died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on june 25 , 2009 , which dr. @entity34 told police he used to treat the pop icon 's insomnia as he prepared for a tour produced by @entity9			2
they jurors used the words " stunned , " " upset " and " shocked " when they were told they had to stop deliberations after a majority agreed that the answer was " no " to the second question on the verdict form -- " was dr. @entity34 unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired ? " one juror called the question " a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case			1
" " after sitting through almost six months of the trial in this case , i believed that mrs. @entity21 had proven her case against @entity9 , " another juror said			2
" despite this fact , i had no way of voting in favor of the plaintiffs because of the way that the verdict form was worded			2
" @entity4 lawyers , in their arguments for a new trial , contend that @entity71 judge @entity70 erred by denying their request to add the words " at any time " to the question			2
the four jurors , whose names were redacted from the documents released by the court , agreed			0
" i would like the judge to know that we did not have the opportunity to deliberate or render a verdict on the plaintiffs claims that dr @entity34 did not become unfit or incompetent until after the conflict of interest was created , dr. @entity34 's duties were changed , pressures were mounting , or even after the contract was prepared and signed by dr. @entity34 , " one juror said			2
the jury voted " no " only after one member convinced them that the question could have only meant " at the time he was hired , " two of the juror statements said			0
@entity34 talks about @entity4 's death " during our deliberations , i asked to send a question to the judge to explain question 2 , but by then the foreman had already answered ' no ' and followed the instructions to sign the form , " one said			1
" i feel so cheated because i sat through five months of trial and listened to a lot of evidence on the ethical conflict created -- yet i never got to even deliberate at all on that issue or even review the hundreds of exhibits that had been brought in			0
" another juror said they decided not to ask the judge for direction on the second question because " we did not want anyone to know where we were in deliberations			0
" " i do not believe that the verdict form was fair or worded correctly , and as phrased , @entity125 2 was a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case , " a juror said			1
the same juror described the emotional toll it has caused			0
" since the jury verdict , i have been very upset , and initially i was unable to eat or even check my e-mails because i was so sorry about the verdict and the fact that justice was not done in this case , because of how question 2 on the verdict form was worded			1
" " i do not think that justice was achieved in this case , " another said			0
the affidavits revealed that one of the 12 jurors refused to stop deliberating despite being told it was over			0
" he insisted that we continue answering the rest of the questions , " a juror said			0
judge @entity70 will hear arguments on the new trial motion on january 3 .			0
