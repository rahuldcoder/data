@entity0 -- a @entity3 judge thursday sentenced @entity4 to life in prison without the possibility of parole after jurors convicted him of fatally shooting a father outside a suburban @entity0 day care center			1
@entity13 judge @entity12 delivered the sentence less than two hours after a jury of nine women and three men found @entity4 guilty of malice murder " beyond a reasonable doubt , but mentally ill. " " this situation was brought about by your hands , " @entity12 said , adding that the act " appeared to be a planned execution			1
" in november 2010 , @entity25 was shot multiple times in the parking lot of @entity28 after dropping off his then - 2 - year - old son in what police described as a " cold and calculated murder			1
" the jury had three options , after beginning deliberations tuesday : to find @entity4 guilty of murder , to find him guilty but mentally ill or to find him not guilty by reason of insanity , as he 'd pleaded			1
they chose the second course			0
that meant @entity12 could either have sentenced @entity4 to life in prison with the possibility of parole in at least 30 years , or life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
@entity4 will be evaluated for mental illness in prison , and if diagnosed as mentally ill will be treated while incarcerated			1
after the verdict was delivered , @entity48 described his 36 - year - old brother as a " good provider , " " devoted son , " " wonderful brother " and a " great father " to his two children			2

he called the man that he killed " a good man			0
" " i am so , so , so sorry			0
i ca n't say it enough , " @entity4 said			1
during closing arguments and again thursday after the sentence was handed down , defense attorney @entity69 claimed that the victim 's widow had " manipulated our client , who was mentally sick			1
" " i believe she preyed upon him and used him to commit the crime that she is responsible for , " @entity75 said thursday , noting that he did not believe that @entity76 knew specifics of the shooting plan even as he suggested she inspired it			0
she has not been charged			2
following the sentencing , @entity13 district attorney @entity86 did not elaborate on whether @entity76 might be charged later			2
he said only that " it is something that we have under review right now			0
" " justice has been served here , " @entity86 told reporters , saying the focus thursday should be on @entity94 and not his widow			0
" i want to thank @entity98 that finally , after a year and a half or more , this family -- a good family -- is able to begin the process of healing			0
" at the time of the shooting , @entity4 was @entity76 's supervisor at work and both the defense and prosecution accused her of having an affair with the defendant			1
she denied the accusation in her testimony during the trial			0
" there was no affair			0
who kills someone else 's husband ? " @entity76 said , claiming that @entity4 said he 'd cared about her , her husband and her family before the shooting			1
the jury also found @entity4 guilty of using a firearm in the commission of a felony			1
@entity12 sentenced @entity4 to five years in prison for that charge , to be served concurrently with his life sentence			1
witnesses testimony and evidence presented during the trial showed @entity4 tried to disguise himself , staked out the victim , conceal his plan and later conceal evidence tied to the shooting			1
on the day of the murder , witnesses told police they saw a man -- later proven to be @entity4 -- come up from behind @entity25 and open fire in @entity141 , a community about 15 miles north of @entity0			1
the shooter then fled the scene in a silver minivan without a valid license plate			0
@entity25 , a native of @entity147 , @entity148 , received an mba from @entity150 and was an active volunteer with the @entity3 chapter of the @entity153			0
@entity4 , then 48 , was arrested nearly two months after the shooting			2
during his trial , which began last month , the prosecution had argued that @entity4 was not insane			2
@entity86 , the district attorney , urged jurors to " use your common sense ... and you apply it to determine whether or not somebody is malingering or telling the truth			0
" " he 's insane , he sees angels , he sees demons , he 's crazy			0
' something 's wrong with me , ' " @entity86 said , repeating assertions made by @entity4 and his defense team			1
" if you can not trust the ingredients on this insanity sandwich , then i 'm going to ask you -- do n't eat it			0
" @entity69 said that he and other defense team members plan to talk soon with @entity173 , to discuss what their next step will be			0
but he suggested that an appeal should be forthcoming			0
" we still do believe that a jury should return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity , " @entity69 said			0
" we did n't get that this time , but we 're not about giving up			2
" an attorney for @entity76 released a statement late thursday saying her client " is grateful for and relieved by the jury 's guilty verdict and sentence			2
" " nothing can bring back her husband , but it is reassuring to her that , after all of the noise and distractions surrounding this case , some measure of justice has been done for @entity94 , " said the lawyer , @entity189			2
