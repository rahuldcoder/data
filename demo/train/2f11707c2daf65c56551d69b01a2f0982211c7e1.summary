conventional wisdom has it that president @entity3 's campaign four years ago was a political masterpiece			1
yes , the @entity6 brand was in the toilet ; the economy had cratered ; his real opponent , @entity9 , was a political pariah ; and the country despaired for a new direction			2
still , we recall the @entity3 campaign as a crushing force , brilliantly harnessed , riding the tide of history			1
so why is his re-election campaign such a mess ? @entity21 has turned the candidate of hope and change into a ferociously political animal			1
they 've discarded their most valuable asset , his stature			0
the outsider who flew above the hated , polarized politics of red and blue now does nothing but campaign and polarize			2
the @entity3 who was " one of us , " apart from @entity35 , is increasingly and , to his detriment , " one of them			1
" we first picked up this change in sentiment a few weeks ago in our @entity41 of 12 key swing states when we asked independent voters who " is just another politician ? " @entity3 edged out @entity46 by 4 points			1
the candidate of soaring ideals has tumbled to @entity50 , muddied and mired in politics			0
yet @entity21 has proved it can still effect change : consistently , they make their situation worse			0
this past week , the @entity3 who supported gay marriage when running for @entity58 legislature , then flipped against it as candidate for president , flopped once more to serve his re-election			1
the president 's reversal did not just evolve			1
though same - sex marriage was not " right " earlier , it suddenly became a matter of conviction			1
with the @entity72 approaching , the president needed to energize his base and defuse the likelihood of a platform war over same - sex marriage			1
miraculously , at that moment , he found the courage to do the most politically useful thing			0
many of us who support the president 's new position still found the politics as subtle as neon			2
the maneuvering became the message			0
the latest @entity88 / @entity87 reveals 67 % of those interviewed said the president made his decision " for political reasons			1
" less than a quarter of voters believe he acted on principle			2
@entity96 have started to connect a swarm of dots , revealing politics as the pattern			0
even when this president crosses oceans , @entity96 see him putting politics first			0
recently , in perhaps the most damning @entity105 moment yet in a presidential race , @entity3 was captured putting domestic politics ahead of foreign policy			2
he was caught on an open microphone , telling outgoing @entity111 prime minister @entity110 that he would be more amenable to @entity111 interests on the issue of missile defense if he survived the november elections			0
" this is my last election , " @entity3 said			2
" after my election , i have more flexibility			0
" the president 's mask slipped			0
the politician beneath was revealed			0
voters , including the president 's core female supporters , got to see what they had only suspected : @entity3 's priorities are n't necessarily theirs			1
while our economy was melting down , @entity3 spent his first two years compulsively advocating a health care plan			2
while moms struggle to stretch their family budget and fill the gas tank , @entity3 's crusading for birth control and same - sex marriage			1
and now , as storm clouds from @entity139 's exhaustion and @entity141 's failure begin to roll into our heartland , trapping our economy without exit , the president offers tacit acknowledgment that this is the best he can do : his campaign is about everything but what will save us			2
the latest @entity88 / @entity87 says 50 % of voters believe the president is doing a good job			1
the problem ? they do n't think it is the job he should be doing			0
only 43 % of @entity96 are voting for him			1
@entity6 have never been able to paint @entity3 as a flip - flopper , despite a litany of evidence			1
candidate @entity3 supported " pay as you go budgeting , " but the economic meltdown excused him from his commitment , allowing him to propose a decade of trillion - dollar deficits			1
he spent a trillion dollars on health care , but explained it was a practical strategy to save money			0
in the same moment , he has urged both expensive stimulus and deficit reduction			0
still he has been excused , as a practical man , with long and short - range fiscal tools on his workbench			0
he reviled the @entity9 tax cuts and the " tired and cynical philosophy , " behind them			0
then he pragmatically extended them , calling his pirouette a " substantial victory for middle class families " who would otherwise have suffered a tax increase			0
the @entity3 running for re-election is for everything and nothing at once , a creature of calculation			1
his oratorical skills are seen not as gifts that elevate him above the elite political class , but tools that enshrine him as its leader			0
@entity3 has become what he came to @entity35 to change : he is politics			2
there is a good chance the @entity3 campaign is about to disintegrate , if only briefly			1
@entity3 is about to walk through " the valley of death , " where candidates lose their way and are tested on an arid march			2
in this familiar story , the campaign that could do no wrong can do no right : pundits who have predicted an @entity3 victory reverse course and insist @entity46 is a sure bet			1
republicans should restrain their exuberance			0
the race will certainly tighten again if this president fixes a fundamental and possibly fatal political mistake : @entity3 is asking @entity96 to be a polarized , angry country , where we are at war with each other , tearing at our own throats			1
@entity46 is asking us to be a country at peace with itself			0
unless @entity3 changes course , he will not make it through the valley			2
this is a race @entity46 wins .			0

@entity227 : why is @entity3 's team running such an *inexpert* re-election campaign ?
the latest @entity88 / @entity87 poll says only 43 % of voters would vote for @entity3 today
@entity3 's reversal on same - sex marriage was obviously political , says @entity227
@entity227 : @entity3 " is for everything and nothing at once , a creature of calculation "
