-- yes , it looks delicious			0
the peanut butter and chocolate goodness that is the essence of @entity4 now comes in a jar			0
the announcement of @entity8 's new spreads came on @entity9 - fitting given that the vote is still out on whether this creamy concoction will portend the death of @entity13			1
@entity14 , brand manager for @entity15 with the @entity16 , said in a statement that the spreads " offer an authentic @entity8 's experience to fans who are looking for delicious snack options throughout the day			1
" " since 1928 , we have been delivering the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter , " he said			0
" with the launch of @entity8 's spreads , we are honoring our great heritage and bringing consumers a new , but still perfect , way to enjoy the @entity8 's brand			1
" the 13 - ounce jar will compliment @entity16 's existing spread flavors including chocolate , chocolate with almond and chocolate with hazelnut			1
it 's that last combination that has the @entity40 declaring " it 's only a matter of time before jars of @entity13 get pushed toward the back of grocery shelves and begin collecting dust			2
" but here 's why you should n't count @entity13 out just yet : 1			2
it 's sparked crazes in the past the hazelnut spread has literally had people hoarding it			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity53 in @entity54 reported in 2013 that students at @entity56 were costing the school some serious cash by spooning the not - so - cheap delicacy into carryout containers to take back to their dorm rooms			0
the love is strong according to its website , @entity13 was first imported into the @entity64 more than 25 years ago from @entity65			2
since then the fan base has spread ( see what we just did there ? ) to the point that there are tons of sites , @entity67 boards and @entity68 devoted to it			0
and , of course , there is a @entity81 list to tell you whether you 're addicted to it			0
there 's even a " @entity87 " on @entity88 , and trust us , this guy really loves the stuff			0
the thought of a shortage set off panic when the media reported that a march 2014 frost in @entity96 was threatening the hazelnut crop , and could cause a possible @entity13 shortage , the hoarding began again			2
all we can say is : bring it @entity8 's .			1
