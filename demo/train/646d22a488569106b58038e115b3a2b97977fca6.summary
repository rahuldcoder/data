if @entity10 will wait another week , @entity96 will be finished			2
no one will be left alive			0
do they want to wait , and watch them die , and let this crime be a shameful disgrace for the international community forever ? " @entity179			0
gen. @entity180 said weather conditions and tactics by @entity3 regime have hindered their efforts			2
in addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , @entity66 forces have started abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in , making it difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime , @entity180 said			0
