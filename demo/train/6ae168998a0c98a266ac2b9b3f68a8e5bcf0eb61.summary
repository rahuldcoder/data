-- police spotted a man in the gardens of @entity4 and stopped him , concerned he might be an intruder			1
the man in question : prince @entity7 , @entity8			1
he was out for a stroll through the manicured gardens in the early evening			1
@entity7 , the son of @entity11 , was born in the palace in 1960 , has offices there , and spends much of his time there			1
two uniformed officers spotted him at 6 p.m. wednesday , and approached him " to verify his identity , " the @entity16 said in a statement			0
" the man was satisfactorily identified			2
" " the police have a difficult job to do balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders and sometimes they get it wrong , " prince @entity7 -- brother of prince @entity23 and former husband of @entity25 -- said in a statement			1
" i am grateful for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the gardens in the future			1
" the @entity38 press reacted with predictable excitement			0
a few accounts , apparently incorrectly , reported that the officers had their guns drawn			0
one outlet wrote that the prince was " held at gunpoint			2
" according to the authorities , no force was used , and no weapons were drawn			0
guards were already on higher alert when the incident took place			2
two days earlier , it was the real deal : a security breach at @entity4			1
a man scaled a security fence and entered the building before being detained			2
authorities arrested him for burglary , trespass and criminal damage			1
another man was arrested later for alleged conspiracy to commit burglary			1
the incident drew headlines around the world			2
it was the latest in a series of security lapses over the years , a few quite colorful			0
in 2004 " @entity74 " scaled a fence and stood on a ledge to make a point about paternal rights			0
a year earlier , another royal residence , @entity76 , had an uninvited guest : someone dressed as @entity79 showed up at prince @entity81 's birthday party			0
it turned out both incidents had more to do with publicity for the perpetrators than safety of the royal residents			0
" @entity74 " was merely a dad with a cause ; " @entity79 , " a comedian			0
but monday 's alleged burglar seemed different , a more serious matter			0
comparisons were drawn to the time in 1982 that a man made it all the way to the bedside of @entity11			1
the queen talked to that intruder until help arrived			0
as for prince @entity7 , the garden incident was n't his first brush with security gone wrong			1
