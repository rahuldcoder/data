@entity1 's top court has legalized brothels , saying @entity4 prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes and their ability to work in safe environments			1
a panel of five judges wrote that the law banning common bawdy houses " is grossly disproportionate " if all it aims to do is keep public order in a neighborhood and maintain public health standards			1
" the record is clear that the safest way to sell sex is for a prostitute to work indoors , in a location under her control , " the judges wrote in a much anticipated ruling			1
" the impact on those put at risk by the legislation is extreme , " the judges added			2
however , the court stopped short of allowing prostitutes to openly solicit customers on the streets			1
the court ruled that prohibiting solicitation remains a " a reasonable limit on the right to freedom of expression			2
" " it is so nice to see that we are now brought out into society			0
i feel a debutante at a ball			0
we 're almost full citizens , so this is wonderful , " said @entity44 , a former prostitute			2
supporters of the ruling said the laws governing prostitution in @entity4 would now have to change			1
" any form of criminalization pushes the industry underground and gives opportunities to predators			0
you can see it through the world , " said @entity55 , executive director of @entity56			0
the judicial panel ruled that the changes should not take affect for at least one year , allowing the government to amend its criminal code			0
any of those changes would apply to the entire country , not just the province of @entity1			1
but the @entity4 government released a statement saying it was now weighing its legal options			0
" as the prime minister ( @entity74 ) has said , prostitution is bad for society and harmful to communities , women and vulnerable persons , " @entity70 , @entity4 's justice minister , said in a statement released by his office			2
the government indicated it would review the decision , but an appeal to @entity4 's @entity81 is also a possibility .			0
