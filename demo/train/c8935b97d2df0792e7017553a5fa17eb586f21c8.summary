editor 's note : spoiler alert ! if you have n't watched " @entity5 's " series finale , stop reading now			1
( @entity6 ) -- after " @entity5 's " series finale on wednesday , star @entity7 spoke to @entity6 about the " big get " and that pitch - perfect ending			1
the hour revolved around @entity12 ( @entity13 ) trying to find a way to break the news to best friend @entity16 ( @entity17 ) that he was leaving him and @entity19 to go to @entity20 to be with @entity21 ( @entity22 )			0
in the end , he did it by recording a message on dvd			0
if you teared up when it first became clear that @entity16 was watching a disc , you 're not alone			0
another great moment was @entity31 ( @entity32 ) watching his goodbye dvd and deciding not to listen to @entity12 admit what @entity35 's always suspected ( that @entity12 's not actually psychic )			2
you may even have gotten a little misty when @entity12 hugged his father @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , and finally called him for help on a case -- also acceptable			0
before we get to the ending , let 's talk about those three casting @entity44 : @entity45 played @entity16 ' boss			1
" there 's been a runner throughout ' @entity5 ' that maybe @entity16 played @entity49 on ' @entity50 ' as a child , and @entity45 is the real @entity49 , " @entity7 explains			1
' psych ' : @entity7 's prized pop culture possession can not be beat @entity53 has been referenced on " @entity5 " more times than @entity7 can count			1
" we 've been chasing him for a while , so to have him as the final villain ever on ' @entity5 ' felt really , really right			1
" and then the " ultimate gift to our fans , " he says , was finally seeing @entity59			0
@entity62 on - screen -- and having him be played by @entity64 , another actor who 's been regularly referenced on the show			1
" we knew the longer the show lasted , the bigger the payoff it would be to finally be able to show who this person was			0
@entity64 was our first choice , and as you learn in television , sometimes you do n't even get your 10th choice , " @entity7 says			1
" i am eternally grateful to @entity64 for doing this , and i think he will soon discover just how much of an impact it 's going to have			1
and trivia , it was actually the last thing that we ever shot on ' @entity5 , ' because we did it in @entity82 not in @entity83			1
" the landing of @entity64 is a story in itself			1
@entity17 was hanging out with a friend who runs the @entity87			0
" they do these giant celebrity - laden readings every year , and he said , ' you know , @entity64 's done those for us in the past			1
@entity64 's actually a really good friend of mine			1
i wonder if he has any idea how many times you guys talk about him on your show			0
' they were like having brunch , and he said , ' let 's just call him and ask him			2
' and the next thing @entity17 knew , he was on the phone with @entity106 , who of course had never seen our show and had no idea what anybody was talking about			0
but @entity17 , being the proactive guy that he is , just put him right on the spot right there on the phone			0
what 's @entity64 gon na say ? ' yeah , of course , it sounds fun			1
' but then we actually had to put in the legwork , " @entity7 says			1
' psych ' : @entity17 sings for our pop culture personality test in the end , @entity16 quit his job and followed @entity12 to @entity20 to live a life of adventure			2
he made it just in time to witness @entity12 's proposal to @entity21 -- of course she agreed to marry them , mostly @entity12 -- and jump in the car to chase after a thief who stole the heirloom engagement ring			2
" the proposal scene was sort of hanging over our heads forever			0
there were so many different versions of how @entity12 would propose , or if @entity12 should propose			0
we did n't want anybody to hate us , but we also needed it to be ' psych ' through and through			1
we did n't want to cop out and have a proposal just because that 's what you 're supposed to do			2
so i feel like we figured out a way to do it that 's just a little off and , " he says , laughing , " still results in the wackiness that you had come to expect from us			2
we knew we were never gon na have a wedding			2
that decision was made a while ago , like we 're not gon na go there			0
but i do think it was important to let everybody know that hey , these two are going to be together , you do n't have to worry about that			0
" these three , @entity7			2
" the three of them are going to be together			0
