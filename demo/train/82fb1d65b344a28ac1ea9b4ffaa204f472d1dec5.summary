@entity0 -- the @entity2 offered its tentative endorsement of so - called " organizing agreements " between unions and for - profit companies , with some justices saying on wednesday the longstanding practice can encourage good labor relations			1
at issue is whether the particulars of such an agreement between @entity16 here local 355 and the @entity12 casino in @entity13 violates a federal law that prohibits companies from giving labor unions -- seeking to represent workers -- anything " of value			1
" worker rights experts and business groups have called this one of the most significant labor relations cases in decades , and a high court ruling could have major implications for the future of the union movement in the @entity30			1
the gaming union entered into a " neutrality " agreement with the company , agreeing to work together to pass a ballot initiative legalizing slot machines in @entity37 and @entity38 , a deal that ostensibly would benefit both sides			1
unite here independently spent more than $ 100,000 in an ad campaign supporting the measure			0
it also agreed not to strike or boycott			0
the casino in return allowed union members onto the premises , gave them employee contact information , and agreed to remain neutral in the organizing campaign			1
the high court debated in oral arguments whether this particular agreement violated the letter and spirit of the broader law , designed to prevent bribery , corruption and extortion in negotiations and organizing			1
a lower federal appeals court said " if the $ 100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions , then that 's corrupt , and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides , " said justice @entity65			2
" tell me how i deal with that niggling problem i have about the $ 100,000 , because it does feel like a bribe to the employer			0
" but justice @entity70 said , " i would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer / employee agreements , " she said			0
" the idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them , regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that			1
" the lawsuit was brought by @entity85 , an employee of @entity86 , who opposed the union 's efforts to get him to join			2
backed by the @entity91 , his lawyers said " backroom deals " between company and union management undercut his right of association and free choice			2
@entity98 of the @entity99 makes it a crime for an employer to " pay , lend or deliver ... any money or other thing of value " to a union that wants to represent its workforce			2
" that 's the danger that 302 exists to take care of , not that it 's necessarily wrongful per se for a union to have lists of ( employee ) information or the use of property , but what will it do in return ? " attorney @entity108 told the high court in an intense hour of oral augments			2
" and unions have compromised employee interests in exchange for this type of assistance			0
they certainly have extorted employers			0
" several justices suggested the casino and the union were engaged in a quid pro quo , but were not sure that amounted to an exchange of something of " value			1
" " i mean , the union would n't promise that for nothing , " said justice @entity136			1
" it would get something in exchange such as , in this case , the right to go on the employer 's property to recruit union members or some other thing of value from the employer , right ? " but @entity152 , @entity151 's lawyer , said this neutrality agreement and the $ 1000,000 ad campaign were like so many others , including the pending deal to build a massive oil pipeline through the middle section of the @entity30			1
" the union , like so many construction unions that we know , is advocating in @entity162 for the passage of laws like the @entity165			1
why did they do that ? they do it because they want the jobs , " he said			0
" that is a combination of interests funneled through the @entity176 's protection for mutual effort			0
" justice @entity178 seemed to agree , telling messenger that his client 's views run " contrary to years of settled practices and understandings			0
" @entity151 represents about 265,000 active members in the @entity30 and @entity186 , mainly in the hospitality , food service and manufacturing industries			0
the case is @entity151 local 355 v. @entity85 ( 12 - 99 )			0
a ruling is expected by the spring .			0

case involves agreement between union and @entity13 casino
union campaigns for legal slot machines , casino gives it *access* to workers ' info
@entity2 debates whether that violates law that says unions ca n't give firms things " of value "
