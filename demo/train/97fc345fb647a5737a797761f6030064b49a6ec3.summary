-- imagine what it must be like to be born in one country but only know another , to be labeled " illegal " but feel 100 % @entity5 , and to be asking for special dispensation from a government that has shown a flair for arresting and deporting people just like you			1
" @entity12 " does n't have to imagine this life			0
he 's too busy living it			1
the recent high school graduate is one of about 82,000 dreamers who opted to roll the dice on a new government program that promises temporary relief for young illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity5 as children , have no criminal record and are pursuing higher education			1
they 're called @entity24 because they might have qualified for legal status under the @entity24 if the bill had n't died in the @entity28 in december 2010 when 36 @entity29 and 5 @entity30 voted against cloture			1
@entity12 agreed to talk to me , but only if i agreed not to reveal his name or give out too much personal information about him or his parents			1
opinion : ' illegal immigrant ' is the uncomfortable truth ah yes , the parents			0
if there 's an illegal immigrant who was brought here by his parents , there is a good chance that his parents are undocumented as well			1
and here the government -- the same agency that carries out deportations , @entity48 -- is asking you to hand over your personal information , including your address , where agents might find you and your parents and haul you all away			1
@entity12 graduated from high school with honors a few months ago , and now he 's in a state of suspended animation			1
he ca n't enroll in college , because he ca n't afford the cost of out - of - state tuition			1
unlike many of his friends , he does n't have a job			0
but it is n't because he does n't want to work			1
the problem is that he does n't have a social security number or a driver 's license			2
he ca n't go forward , and he ca n't go backward			0
@entity12 's parents brought him to the @entity5 from @entity69 as a child			1
this is where he was raised , and he ca n't imagine living anywhere else			0
" this is the only country i 've known all my life , " he told me			0
he dreams of getting a driver 's license , getting a job , going to college , attending medical school , perhaps one day becoming a doctor			2
but , all his plans are written in sand			0
in @entity12 's life , nothing is certain			2
nothing , that is , but the two or three page application he filled out to apply for @entity89			2
it was , for him , an easy decision			0
he had waited a long time for a chance like this			0
and he quickly seized the opportunity			0
that was probably a smart thing to do			0
deferments could be granted on a first - come , first - served basis			2
he is supposed to receive a response in the mail in the next few weeks			0
radio : undocumented students in their own words the @entity89 program , in the universe of immigration enforcement , falls somewhere between a leap of faith and a crapshoot			1
if granted temporary relief , applicants can apply for a two - year work visa			1
there 's no direct path to permanent legal status or @entity5 citizenship , and the deferment can be revoked at any time			1
meanwhile , the federal government -- which previously did n't know you existed , and you liked it that way -- has opened a file , taken your fingerprints and collected all your information			2
it 's not a very good deal			2
but , for undocumented youth , it 's the only deal on the table			1
so far , there are few takers			0
the 82,000 who have submitted applications are just 7 % of the estimated 1.2 million people who are eligible for the relief			2
to qualify , an applicant has to meet certain criteria : be under the age of 31 , brought to the @entity5 before the age of 16 , have lived continuously in the @entity5 since june 15 , 2007 ; no criminal record , in school or graduated high school , or a military veteran			1
according to immigration lawyers i 've spoken to , who have been fielding calls from dreamers who have lots of questions , some would - be applicants worry that @entity149 could win the election ; the @entity29 will not say whether he would sustain the deferment			1
all he has said is that we need a permanent solution and that he would replace the program with a better one			2
in june , @entity149 told a gathering of the @entity157 that he would " put in place my own long - term solution that will replace and supersede the president 's temporary measure			1
" what does that mean ? no one knows			0
but , according to the lawyers , other would - be applicants are just as worried about the possibility of an @entity170 victory			1
which @entity170 will show up in his second term : the one who proposed the solution , or the one whose excessive deportation policies created the problem ? during a recent forum sponsored by @entity178 , the @entity180 - language television network , @entity170 said he announced the new policy because , as he met with young people from around the country , he concluded that it was n't " fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation			1
" that 's a nice sentiment , mr. president			2
you 're the one who created the cloud by deporting a record 1.4 million people in about four years			2
that is what happens when a bureaucracy goes overboard			0
it is a record to be ashamed of			0
so , if @entity170 is re-elected , do things get better for the undocumented or worse ? no one knows			1
meanwhile , @entity12 is aware of the risk			0
what really drove it home , he said , was when his mother , who is also undocumented , had to take him to the local @entity48 office to fill out the application			2
he worried something might happen to her , that someone might question her , that she might give the wrong answer			0
what about him ? was n't he worried about putting himself in jeopardy ? here he is walking into the jaws of the beast , so to speak , right into the office of the very agency that is breaking all deportation records under this president			0
was n't he afraid that he was making a mistake ? " there 's always that thought in the back of your mind , " he said			0
" because you 're giving over all this information to these people who have total control over whether you get to stay here or not			1
it was a little nerve - racking , but we got through it			0
and now we 're just waiting and hoping for the best			0
" nerve - racking is right			0
a lot of good people are putting it all on the line			0
this is a high - stakes game			1
it had better not be rigged			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243			1

@entity245 would - be ' dreamers ' can apply for legal stay in @entity5 if they meet criteria
this gives undocumented people brought to @entity5 as children a two - year work visa
@entity243 : it 's a high - stakes gamble because you give out personal information
@entity243 : people fear if @entity149 wins or even @entity170 , the program could be revoked
