-- @entity1 is making a big play in internet - connected hand - held gaming with a 3g - enabled @entity5 portable system and smartphone game platform unveiled thursday			1
in addition to cell and @entity11 chips for accessing online services , the new @entity5 gadget looks like its predecessor but has a 5 - inch touch - screen and a second analog stick , which is useful for controlling first - person shooters like " @entity17			1
" speaking of which , " @entity17 , " alongside other gun - play franchises like " @entity22 " and " resistance , " will have versions for the new system			2
other games include " @entity25 , " " @entity26 " and " @entity27			0
" games come on memory cards , and some can be downloaded directly to the device			0
@entity1 is doing away with the mini discs it pushed with the original @entity32			2
the new system is tentatively being called @entity33 , or @entity34 , but that will likely change before it launches late this year			1
weirdly , @entity34 also has a touch - sensitive pad on the back of the device , which game developers can consider when thinking up all kids of wacky applications			1
@entity43 , another mobile hardware maker , tried something similar with the @entity46 , but the concept did n't take off			0
the @entity5 system 's finger - friendly back is really the frosting on an array of sweetly stacked ingredients in this high - tech gadget			1
the system has a blazing fast , quad - core processor to help move those graphic - intensive games			0
it has cameras on the front and rear and a microphone			0
there are also sensors inside for detecting location and motion , like those found in top - of - the - line smartphones			0
with a holiday launch window still quite a long way off , @entity1 was mum on details such as a firm release date , price and , as you 've probably noticed , a definitive name for the thing			2
the announcement , made during a news conference in @entity79 , @entity80 , thursday , did n't come as a surprise to gadget enthusiasts			0
several images of different hardware concepts leaked to blogs			0
@entity86 , a @entity1 executive , told @entity0 in october that the current @entity32 system is limited by not having cell connectivity			1
during the news conference , where @entity1 announced the system , the company also provided some tidbits on a smartphone - focused game platform			1
called @entity96 , the software will work on @entity98 devices approved by @entity1 , which will probably include phones and tablets from @entity101			1
details were scarce , but the platform would presumably provide phones with access to high - quality games and perhaps movie downloads			0
@entity5 phones and the upcoming @entity5 hand - held , with its built - in @entity108 , will have a major focus on social networking features , @entity1 said .			2

@entity1 unveils a new *playstation* portable system to launch late this year
the system has @entity117 cell service , a touch - screen and a touch control pad on the back
for smartphones and tablets , @entity1 will launch @entity96 for @entity98 gaming
