the @entity0 says that three independent experts in the field of adult literacy have finished a university - commissioned review of whistleblower @entity7 's research and found flaws in her claims that some athletes were reading at elementary - school levels			1
@entity7 's research , described to @entity13 in january , was based on a sampling of about 180 student - athletes who @entity7 personally worked with over an eight - year period			1
each had taken a 25 - question reading vocabulary test on the @entity20 for @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- an aptitude test used by many universities to gauge the learning level of incoming students			0
without actually naming her , @entity0 released a summary report that implied she incorrectly deduced that 60 % of the sample were reading below a high school level , and that 8 % were reading below a fourth - grade level			1
" outside experts found no evidence to support public claims about widespread low literacy levels , " @entity0 said in a statement			1
@entity0 also said in its summary that each expert independently found similar things -- that this specific test should n't have been used to determine reading levels and also that , based on the same data @entity7 used , a majority of those tested were , in fact , reading at a college level			1
the individual reports were much more nuanced			0
for example , @entity49 , a psychology professor at the @entity50 , found that many scored below average			0
another expert , @entity54 , associate professor of psychology and co-investigator in the @entity57 at @entity58 , said he was not given enough data to answer many of the questions posed about the reading levels of those tested			0
but all three , including @entity63 , assistant professor of higher education at the @entity65 , found that it 's possible @entity7 misread the findings and inaccurately assigned a grade level to the scores			0
all three said the @entity22 test is not a good measure of determining equivalent reading levels			0
@entity0 said these three were chosen " based on their knowledge of adult literacy , assessment and measurement in education , and multivariate analysis			0
" when asked why @entity7 was n't mentioned in the summary , @entity0 spokesman @entity80 told @entity13 , " this is not about her			1
it is about the data and the methodology			0
" the findings are not much different than what the university preliminarily released just days after @entity13 's first report			0
@entity7 and her research were disavowed by the university almost immediately , based on these same claims			2
on friday , @entity7 said she was " disappointed " by the report , and said she will take the time to fully review the " supposedly ' independent ' review of my data			2
" " the fact that they engaged in this exercise without ever seeking input from me or my research partner , and without the raw scores , or an examination of the full battery of tests ... speaks volumes about the true motivations behind today 's press release , " she wrote in a statement			0
" @entity0 personnel with the knowledge and expertise to verify my claims continue to remain and / or are being forced to remain silent			2
" when contacted by @entity13 , the psychologist who administered the tests to the student - athletes in @entity7 's study said she backs @entity7 , and verified that no one at @entity0 has ever reached out to talk to her about her work			1
last month , a @entity122 whistleblower group wrote a letter to @entity0 , demanding the university apologize to @entity7 and launch an investigation into the way it says she has been publicly smeared , most specifically by provost @entity128			2
the group said it was possible state whistleblower laws were broken			0
since the @entity13 report aired , @entity0 has asked for a new investigation into the yearslong " paper class " scandal , in which student - athletes allegedly were taking classes in which the only requirement was completing a single paper			1
attorney @entity140 , who had worked at the @entity141 for 19 years , is reviewing whether it was widely known among staff in athletics that student - athletes were sent to no - show classes where little or no work was required			1
@entity13 first reported this week that @entity148 rep. @entity147 is also demanding the @entity150 answer questions on why @entity0 was never sanctioned for having paper classes			2
@entity7 told @entity13 that the paper classes were widely known and talked about in athletics , where she worked for seven years			2
she also said the paper classes were used to keep eligible some of the student - athletes who were reading at low levels			1

@entity7 *exposed* how @entity0 *enrolls* student - athletes reading at low levels
@entity0 review , involving three experts , says there were flaws in her claims
@entity7 tells @entity13 she should have been allowed to provide input to review
