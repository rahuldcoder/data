@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors say a 25 - year - old @entity4 private accused of aiding the nation 's enemies through the largest leak of classified information in @entity10 history " craved " notoriety			1
the defense on monday painted @entity13			2
@entity14 as " naive but good - intentioned			1
" so began the first day of the former intelligence analyst 's court - martial at @entity0 in @entity1			0
it could be the beginning of the end of a saga that began three years ago when thousands of classified @entity20 and iraq war documents appeared on @entity22			2
some of the @entity10 documents that appeared on @entity24 were shared and then analyzed and reported on by major news outlets such as the @entity26 , the @entity28 newspaper the @entity29 and @entity31 's @entity30			1
though @entity24 ' founder , @entity33 , has grabbed much of the international media spotlight since that time , @entity14 's trial has fanned debate			1
is he a hero or a traitor ? in february , @entity14 pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges he faced and could be sentenced to two decades in prison on those charges			1
but he has not admitted to the most serious count -- aiding the enemies of the @entity10			1
if convicted on that count , he could go to prison for life			0
in an hourlong opening statement monday , prosecutor capt. @entity46 said @entity14 had access and incentive to provide information to the enemy , including information later found in @entity54 's hideout			1
he said the government will provide evidence that material @entity58 operators had delivered to @entity54 can be traced to @entity14 's illicit downloading and transmission to @entity24			1
@entity46 also said @entity14 helped @entity24 edit the cockpit video from a @entity10 helicopter gunship attack that killed about a dozen people in @entity64 , including two @entity66 photojournalists , in 2007			1
an @entity4 aviator will testify how the video can be useful to adversaries , @entity46 said			0
the video showed @entity66 photographer @entity70 had survived an initial strafing by the gunship , but he apparently died when the fliers opened fire on people attempting to get him off the sidewalk where he lay			0
a @entity10 investigation into the attack found that the crew mistook the journalists ' cameras for weapons while seeking out insurgents who had been firing at @entity10 troops in the area			2
@entity46 said disclosures such as the video and other documents @entity24 released represented " potentially actionable information for targeting @entity10 forces			1
" and he said @entity14 , who appeared in court in his full - dress uniform , " used his military training to gain the notoriety he craved			2
" the prosecutor showed slides as part of his statement			0
the first slide was said to be a quote from a message manning once posted , using the instant message handle " bradass87			0
" " if you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8 + months , what would you do ? " it read			0
that is purportedly part of a string of instant messages that a person -- alleged to be @entity14 -- sent to ex-hacker @entity117			1
@entity14 , who was based in @entity64 , allegedly instant - messaged @entity117 and , over a period of days , said that he had accessed documents			1
@entity117 has said he reported manning to authorities			0
prosecutors also said monday that they plan to call forensic experts who recovered chat logs from computers , purported conversations between @entity14 and @entity33 , that will allegedly show how they worked together			2
the government 's case hopes to convince the military judge that @entity14 , an intelligence analyst , " systematically harvested 700,000 government documents , and attempted to hide what he was doing			1
" soldier 's supporters @entity14 's supporters have adopted the phrase : " i am @entity14			1
" one of the country 's most famous leakers , @entity138 , who leaked the @entity139 , says @entity14 should be viewed as a hero			1
the @entity139 showed that the government had lied to @entity142 and the public about the progress of the @entity145			0
@entity138 provided all 7,000 pages to the @entity26 , which published them in 1971			0
during the february hearing , @entity14 spent more than an hour reading a statement that detailed why and how he sent classified material to @entity24			1
he said he passed on information that " upset " or " disturbed " him but he did n't give @entity24 anything he thought would harm the @entity10 if it were made public			2
" i believed if the public was aware of the data , it would start a public debate of the wars , " he told the court			0
on monday , @entity14 's civilian lawyer , @entity158 , told the military judge his client lives by a philosophy that values life , and that he had a custom - made inscription with the word " humanist , " on the back of his dog tags			1
" he 's 22 , excited to be in @entity64 , hopefully to make @entity64 a safer place , " @entity158 said , characterizing his client 's mindset as he began his deployment			1
but @entity14 became deeply affected by an attack on a convoy with his comrades			2
a roadside bomb exploded beneath a car full of civilians that had pulled aside to let the military vehicles pass			0
although members of his 305th @entity183 were not hurt , @entity158 said , at least one civilian was killed			0
that changed @entity14 's outlook on the war , his lawyer said			1
" @entity14 was affected by knowing that civilians were hurt while trying to getting out of the way of the @entity10 convoy			1
manning then started selecting information to reveal , believing that it would be better if it were public , @entity158 said			0
@entity158 said his client was selective in the information he diverted from a controlled - access computer system where he worked as an " all source " intelligence analyst			0
that includes @entity199 cables that @entity24 published			0
the diplomatic messages , @entity14 felt , " showed how we dealt with other countries , how we valued life , and how we did n't , " @entity158 said in court monday			2
" unfortunately , in his youth , he did n't think we ( the @entity10 ) always did the right thing			2
" memory card from an aunt 's computer military officials at @entity0 say the spectators in the courtroom monday included @entity14 's aunt and a cousin			1
prosecutors said investigators recovered a computer memory card from the aunt 's home in @entity220 , @entity1			0
the government said it contained classified information that @entity14 downloaded , and that forensic analysts would testify how they traced it back to him			1
also among the spectators monday was @entity225 , a co-founder of the activist group @entity226 , who recently disrupted a presidential speech to protest conditions for detainees the @entity10 holds at the @entity231 base at @entity232 , @entity233			0
@entity14 is accused of downloading and transmitting hundreds of detainee assessments conducted at @entity232			1
prosecutors say investigators recovered chat logs in which @entity14 later discusses the value of those reports with @entity33			0
prosecutors plan to call several forensic investigators as witnesses			0
in his statement in february , @entity14 said he initially contacted the @entity244 and the @entity26 to offer information			2
he said he either was n't taken seriously or got voice mail , so he gave the material to @entity24			0
@entity24 has never confirmed that @entity14 was the source of its information			0
protests before the trial on saturday , @entity14 's supporters rallied outside @entity0			1
" people came from great distances to stand with a true @entity10 hero , " said @entity253 , director of the @entity254			0
" from @entity14 's demeanor in court , it 's clear he takes strength from the outpouring of support			1
" @entity14 was formally charged in february 2012			2
on the eve of the court - martial , his lawyer , @entity158 , issued a rare public statement through his website			0
he thanked those who raised money and awareness over the past three years , bringing " worldwide attention to this important case			0
" 2012 : prosecutors say @entity14 did n't report any mistreatment to them @entity2 's @entity276 reported from @entity0 and @entity277 wrote in @entity278			2
@entity2 's @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 contributed to this report .			0
