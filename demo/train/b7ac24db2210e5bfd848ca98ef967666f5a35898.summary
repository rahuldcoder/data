@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 has been a leader in sustainable architecture for over 40 years			1
as well as creating a portfolio of inspiring green designs -- notably the 1977 @entity7 in @entity8 -- he is also a teacher and an author			1
his most recent book " @entity11 " traces his ancestral and ecological design roots			1
principal voices talked to @entity3 about the passion which continues to consume his life			1
@entity3 has dedicated his working life to integrating nature 's principals into his designs			1
@entity2 : what inspired you to become an architect ? @entity3 : probably was when i was 14 , i worked out on a farm helping a handyman build a @entity27 cottage from a set of ten dollar magazine plans			1
i just thought the whole process of translating from a two - dimensional set of drawings to a three - dimensional reality was exciting			2
@entity2 : at that time , was there anything that you were interested in pursuing ? @entity37 : let 's see			1
i had a tendency towards art -- painting , drawing and sculpture			2
but my parents were really practical and told me that was n't a suitable profession ! @entity2 : was ecological architecture always something you wanted to pursue ? @entity37 : my first interest was really in what we called @entity53 ( @entity54 )			1
i was interested in the social side of architecture , because it seemed to me that you read architectural criticism and , you know , there was no criteria other than subjective , especially when you consider how a building works for people			1
i helped found @entity54 which never really went very far			2
later on i was the chief architect for the @entity65 and i had money to do that [ @entity54 ] but none of my client agencies wanted to do that			1
@entity2 : what is / was @entity54 ? @entity37 : there is an international association called the @entity74 which kind of grew out of @entity54			1
i started it together with this @entity0 woman called @entity77 who was teaching at @entity78 [ @entity79 ]			2
she did an evaluation of public housing projects			2
and at the same time a fellow called @entity83 wrote a book called " @entity83 " , which was an attack on what was then the standard -- @entity87 [ @entity87 ] , high rise public housing -- which turned out to actually dynamite a number of projects in this country -- in @entity93 , @entity94			2
@entity2 : when you were starting out who did you look up to in the architectural world ? @entity37 : the biggest influence on me was @entity100 who was a peripatetic character who would show up at schools			1
he really provided a larger vision that was far more than just designing a building			2
and that for me was the kind of @entity106 moment -- learning from him that the issue was much larger than the building			2
he was thinking in " whole systems " terms and i have been ever since			2
and then my work was always involved in socially orientated architecture -- when we still cared about that in this country			1
i worked on migrant farm labor housing , i built a lot of prefab systems based on @entity100 's work			1
i was a refugee from @entity122 and as i say in my book [ @entity11 ] i found who i was just kind of being in the leftover pieces of nature that were in @entity127 -- during the war construction stopped			2
so that was a huge influence in shaping my life			2
i lived in @entity127 but i left as soon as i could			2
i really not much of an urbanist			2
i believe in cities , but basically , my work is n't very urban			1
i like to build in places where nature is			0
@entity2 : after the 1973 oil crisis did you notice a change in mood ? was n't there more of a push towards sustainable architecture during that period ? @entity37 : no , that was n't really true of most places			1
i was fortunate to hook up with @entity144			0
his great genius , when he was governor [ of @entity65 ] , was bringing all these outsiders to run these agencies that had always been run by insiders			1
that was a great gift			0
the oil embargo of 1973 did wake some people up			0
[ president ] @entity154 got it but was n't able to sell it			1
we did have some federal initiatives and in @entity65 we have some very strong state initiatives that i 'm proud to say that i had a role in creating			1
that did make a huge difference			0
but then of course @entity163 was elected in 1980 and we just went to sleep for the next twenty - eight years			0
@entity2 : of all the buildings you 've created , do you have a favorite ? @entity37 : some of them are very process related			1
the early work where i had this class in 1971 and we built this little village out of reclaimed materials			1
that was a huge huge learning experience and that was a kind of a rehearsal for then doing this @entity178 -- @entity179 at @entity78 -- which @entity181 magazine called " the birth of green " , which was a nice thing to say because it was n't particularly pretty ! we were just fooling around , figuring stuff out			1
so those are some of the process / learning projects			0
of that early period i think the @entity7 has held up really well for 30 years			1
it created quite a bit of change and awareness in the building and architectural community			0
the fact that you could reduce energy consumption not just by 40 percent -- which was mandated by the laws we passed -- but by 80 percent			0
that 's a landmark favorite for me			0
of a recent one , i would say the @entity204 [ for @entity205 ]			0
another is the @entity207 in @entity208			0
i talk about second generation ecological design where we have a much higher level of integration			1
a lot of the first experiments were just trying to maximize one thing like the sun and then the more we learned we realized we could integrate everything			0
in terms of experimentation , craftsmanship and beauty the @entity220 house [ more commonly known as @entity221 ] is a kind of favorite			0
we worked on it for five or six years			0
i think of it as an experimental project because it 's crazy in terms of four people living in that much space , but just in terms of an exercise and working with new materials like rammed earth it is quite beautiful			0
@entity2 : are you still teaching ? @entity37 : no , i have no formal associations with an institution			1
that part of my life is over			0
@entity2 : but students must contact you all the time wanting advice though			1
what do you tell them ? @entity37 : well , i have an association with down in @entity251 called the @entity252			0
i go there once or twice a year			0
it 's good because it 's a community -- 15 - 20 students -- who work on real projects			1
i tell them to go there			0
@entity2 : what 's your view on architecture education being taught now ? @entity37 : i think that architectural education is pretty broken in terms of what we need to be dealing with today			1
they may have a few courses on sustainability , one or two people on a faculty in a large school who care about this stuff , but they are marginalized			0
@entity2 : who , out of the current crop of big name architects , do you admire ? @entity37 : of the @entity282 , @entity281 ... @entity2 : @entity283 ? @entity37 : and @entity283			1
i think they 're both really good most of the time			0
i like @entity287 because i think he 's a real person			0
he 's made huge breakthroughs in terms of using computers to design complex surfaces			1
@entity2 : @entity292 ? @entity37 : incredible			1
maybe more as an engineer than an architect			1
i like the people who are organic and he 's actually very organic particularly as an engineer			0
the architecture maybe a little less so			1
he did this bridge [ @entity302 ] up in northern @entity65			1
i think his bridges are remarkable			0
people like @entity305 , i really admire what he is doing			0
if i were 40 years younger i 'd be doing that			0
i think he 's good because of anyone doing larger buildings he 's one of the ecological pioneers who 's really thinking about them in a climatic sense			2
there are a lot of good architects who do n't ever get a lot of attention			2
but , you know , architecture still operates with this fountainhead mystique which is such garbage			2
@entity2 : how do your methods of engagement with a project differ from the " normal " processes an architect would go through ? @entity37 : i focus a lot on process and on collaboration			1
we do n't try and sell anybody anything			2
i spend more time interviewing clients than i do trying to sell them something			0
i 'm not sure what the normal architectural process is , but currently it 's bureaucratic			0
it 's all governed by metrics			0
what it seldom gets at is ; what are your aspirations ? what are you trying to do ? the real questions do n't get answered very much			2
now we have leed and that 's become the new excuse not to think			0
and it 's not that it is bad			0
it is an incremental improvement but given what 's happening on the planet right now it 's not enough			0
and the sad thing is that we 've wasted 30 years			0
we 're gon na pay big time for that			0
maybe we can play catch up but it 's going to take a huge shift .			0
