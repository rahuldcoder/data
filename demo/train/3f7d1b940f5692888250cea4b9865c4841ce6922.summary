-- in november , dozens of armed men descended on a town in northern @entity3 and killed more than 100 people in a coordinated series of bombings and gun attacks			0
many of those targeted were @entity10 , but police stations and mosques deemed " insufficiently @entity13 " were also attacked			1
the town was @entity14 , capital of the @entity3 state of @entity17 , and the assailants belonged to the group @entity19 , which translates from the local @entity20 as " @entity22 education is outlawed			1
" in two years , @entity19 has morphed from a radical @entity24 sect into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in @entity3 and beyond			1
western intelligence analysts believe it is also developing links with @entity31 affiliates in @entity32			0
@entity19 's targets include police outposts and churches , as well as places associated with ' western influence			1
' its signature attack is a @entity40 - style drive - by shooting from a motorbike , but this year it has begun a campaign of suicide vehicle attacks			0
in @entity47 , the epicenter of the insurgency , there is a heavy military presence , with security checkpoints , sandbagged military positions and the scars left by bomb attacks			0
@entity0 : @entity3 officials condemn church attack house - to - house searches are common			0
a senior military officer admitted last week that @entity47 was a dangerous place , with " miscreants " slipping across the nearby borders with @entity60 and @entity61			0
the @entity3 authorities seem unable to overcome @entity19 -- and its growing footprint worries neighboring states and the @entity65			1
many christians in northeastern @entity3 have fled their homes as the violence has worsened this year			0
a government offer of amnesty has had little effect ; the deployment of 20,000 @entity3 troops to deal with ethnic and religious violence has failed to subdue the group			2
president @entity76 has warned of " swift and certain justice for criminal elements " -- but analysts say that the inefficiency of the @entity3 state , rampant corruption and a heavy - handed military response may play into @entity19 's hands			1
until 2009 , @entity19 was a fundamentalist sect that espoused a @entity87 - like interpretation of @entity13			1
it did not advocate violence but it was hostile to @entity3 's @entity24 leadership for its compromises with the ' infidel			0
' one day in july that year , police stopped some of its members on motorbikes -- and told them to wear helmets			2
when the bikers resisted , police opened fire -- killing nine members of the group , according to witness reports collected by @entity104 , the president of the @entity105			1
the @entity105 is an independent human rights group based in northern @entity3 , and @entity104 has had extensive contacts with figures in @entity19			1
in the days after that confrontation , hundreds of @entity19 members were killed in clashes with security services			1
among them , the group 's charismatic leader @entity112 , who died while in the custody of police , according to @entity104			1
a secondary school dropout , @entity112 preached a strict application of @entity119 law in northern @entity3 , arguing that the rich and connected had evaded @entity119 despite its formal adoption by several muslim - majority states in @entity3			0
his message resonated with thousands of marginalized @entity24			0
@entity19 can also draw on the deepening inequalities and religious divide between north and south @entity3 to help recruitment			1
after the crackdown , security services accused the group of planning an armed jihad in @entity3 by stockpiling weapons , including guns , explosives , and grenades , and purchasing land for paramilitary training			2
a significant number of members fled to neighboring @entity61 and @entity60			0
but far from this being a victory for the security services , it brought @entity19 members into contact with @entity143 ( @entity143 )			1
according to @entity146 officials , the groups have since forged a partnership -- with @entity143 sharing its evolving expertise in suicide bombing			0
" we know that there are increasingly frequent contacts , and indeed , training of members of @entity19 by @entity143 , and that 's of great concern , " ambassador @entity150 , @entity65 's civilian deputy said earlier this month			1
@entity158 officials , long concerned at the growth of @entity143 , have voiced the same concerns			0
and last week a senior @entity3 military officer told @entity162 : " @entity19 is @entity31			1
" in a global poll conducted by the @entity165 in 2009 , a higher percentage of @entity3 @entity24 ( 54 % ) stated they had confidence in @entity167 than in any other @entity24 - majority country			0
@entity19 's muscle was enhanced a year ago when the group freed at least a hundred of its members from a prison in @entity174 in northeastern @entity3			1
this year , @entity19 has begun looking to new horizons , including the capital , @entity177			1
in june , the group carried out its first suicide bombing -- attacking the national police headquarters			1
two months later -- in a dramatic escalation of its campaign -- it launched a suicide car bombing against the @entity184 headquarters in @entity177 , killing 23			0
@entity19 released a video featuring a martyrdom recording by the suicide bomber in the attack -- a- 27 - year - old from @entity47 -- who praised @entity167 and referred to the @entity184 headquarters as a " forum of all the global evil			1
" the @entity184 attack , @entity104 says , was likely an attempt by @entity19 to embarrass the @entity3 government			1
he believes the group 's @entity197 decided that attacking the @entity184 would create less of a backlash against the group than directly targeting @entity146 interests			2
" when they attacked the @entity184 headquarters , they had to pass the @entity204 to @entity3 just a few meters away , but they knew the implications of targeting @entity146 interests : that things would get worse for them , " @entity104 said			2
@entity146 officials believe some of those involved in that plot may have also trained with the @entity31 linked militant group @entity210 in @entity211			2
in september , @entity146 military officials warned that @entity19 , @entity143 , and @entity210 might make common cause in targeting @entity146 interests in the region			1
earlier this month , the @entity146 @entity204 in @entity3 warned that @entity19 may be plotting to target three luxury hotels in @entity177			2
@entity31 in @entity217 & @entity32 ? according to @entity104 , the group 's agenda is still primarily local			2
" the origin of their fight is with the government of @entity3 and the security agencies , " @entity104 said			0
" they want an end to the government 's campaign against them and for them to pull troops out of northeastern @entity3			0
" analysts believe some @entity19 members might be tempted by payouts made by the government to militants in the @entity236 in recent years in exchange for their laying down arms			2
but one attempt at mediation has already ended in disaster			0
in september , a leading figure in @entity47 connected to the group who sat down for talks with a former president of @entity3 was assassinated within 48 hours			2
@entity104 helped set up the meeting ; he says he has since received death threats himself			0
security analysts are concerned the group may try to target @entity3 's oil industry in the @entity236 , destabilizing supplies from the world 's eighth largest oil exporter			2
over the past decade , pipelines and rigs in the area have been repeatedly targeted by the @entity258 ( @entity258 )			0
the area is predominantly @entity10 and western intelligence sources say it would be difficult for @entity19 to establish a presence there			1
human rights activists say for now , the authorities ' crackdown in northern @entity3 may have the effect of radicalizing more muslims			0
according to @entity104 and others tracking the group , @entity19 has drawn its membership mainly from disaffected youngsters and unemployed graduates			1
but it has also gathered support among the professions			0
@entity274 says it has documented serious abuses by @entity3 police , including extrajudicial executions against suspected members of @entity19			1
" the security forces are punishing people who they believe provide shelter to @entity19 , but if you reveal the identity of @entity19 fighters , then they 'll kill you			2
you can see the dilemma , " @entity104 said			0
" if @entity3 government ca n't solve the problem , and the violence continues , then this virus will spread across the countries of @entity291 and @entity32 , emboldening the group and boosting its membership , making it a well - established part of @entity31 , " he said			0
today the @entity3 media , like its politicians , are full of advice to the government on how to tackle @entity19 -- from an even tougher military response to renewed attempts at dialogue , another amnesty and a more comprehensive effort to address the root causes of the violence			2
neither carrot nor stick has worked so far .			0

many of those targeted are @entity10
police stations and mosques deemed ' insufficiently @entity13 ' are also attacked
assailants belong to the group @entity19 , which translates to " @entity22 education is outlawed "
