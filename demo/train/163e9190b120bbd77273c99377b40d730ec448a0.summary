-- she stumbled into the business naked , bleeding and burned			0
and in desperate need of help			0
this 16 - year - old girl thankfully got it , and more than a month later is in good condition at a hospital and undergoing rehab , @entity12 , @entity13 , sheriff 's capt. @entity10 said			1
and the man accused of doing this to her ? authorities say they think he is now in custody in @entity19 , where he was caught coming out of a vehicle with a woman he 'd allegedly abducted sunday night in @entity24			1
the suspect in both cases is @entity27 , 37			1
talking about @entity27 , @entity24 police commissioner @entity28 said authorities " do n't know much ( about him ) other than the fact he 's a thug and this is what he does , apparently			1
" " people like this , there 's nothing that makes sense , " @entity28 told reporters			0
" do n't even try to find it			0
" abducted @entity24 woman found alive official : @entity43 doused with gas , bleach , set on fire there 's no way of avoiding the horror , however , of what at least two young women endured about 275 miles away and just over a month from each other			1
the @entity13 teen went missing first , with her family calling the @entity55 on october 1			1
her nightmare began when , she later told police , the teenager was hit in the head with a shovel and stuffed into the trunk of a car , according to @entity10			1
the girl told police that her abductor took her to his parents ' house in @entity12 and sexually assaulted her			0
( @entity27 ' parents do n't remember whether they were home at the time , the sheriff 's captain said			1
) he then showed her pictures of other girls , claiming he 'd done the same thing to them , according to the 16 - year - old			0
two days later , the suspect allegedly brought the then - naked girl into the backyard , poured bleach and gasoline on her , burned her clothes and dug a hole			1
" how do you want to die ? " he asked , the teenager told police			1
when he got distracted , the girl fled into the woods			0
two miles away , employees at a @entity12 business spotted her and brought her inside , @entity10 explained			0
she was suffering from third - degree burns , but she was alive			0
chief calls @entity27 ' a vicious predator ' dna from the victim was put into a national database to try to find her abductor			1
on october 28 , that test matched with @entity27 -- the same man the teenage girl @entity102 from a photo lineup of mug shots , according to @entity10			1
after all , @entity27 had been in jail before			2
@entity10 said that @entity27 had an extensive criminal history , and an online public records search bears that out			2
it shows dozens of charges from over the years , from traffic infractions to use of a firearm in a robbery to aggravated assault and false imprisonment			0
then there are the charges of attempted capital murder , abduction , forcible rape , malicious wounding and malicious wounding using a chemical , in the @entity13 case			1
the latest allegation comes from @entity24 , one of a few places ( along with @entity12 , @entity129 and @entity130 in @entity13 ) where @entity27 has lived			1
that 's where video , released by police , showed 22 - year - old @entity136 - @entity135 walking just blocks from her home when she is brought to the ground and forced into a vehicle sunday			0
her glasses and cell phone drop onto the road during the struggle			0
but , even after she breaks out a passenger 's side window , her efforts prove futile as the car pulls away			2

@entity135 and @entity27 were found three days later in @entity154 , @entity19 , 15 miles southwest of @entity155			2
a big reason authorities managed to track them down had do with @entity27 ' past , but not the criminal variety			2
a car dealer who had sold the vehicle allegedly used in @entity135 's abduction tipped off authorities after recognizing @entity27 from a surveillance video released by police , @entity28 said			1
the dealer had placed a gps in the car because of worries about @entity27 ' bad credit , according to @entity10			1
videos , tips lead authorities to alleged abductor following his arrest , @entity27 was booked into the @entity178 detention center in @entity179 at 3:40 a.m. thursday			2
he waived his extradition to @entity13			2
@entity27 is scheduled to make an appearance in court november 12 , according to @entity10			0
the @entity24 police commissioner hopes @entity27 will always be in the sights of law enforcement			1
