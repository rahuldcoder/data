@entity0 -- as @entity2 digests the government 's recent call for deeper engagement with @entity6 -- and @entity7 in particular -- one @entity2 billionaire with interests in @entity7 has offered some advice			1
" stop viewing @entity7 like it 's the @entity15 , " @entity11 , who owns multimillion dollar casino businesses in @entity2 and @entity13 , said at a recent tourism forum			1
" start viewing them as a modern member of the industrialized world			0
" the chairman of @entity20 , @entity11 wants what he calls " frosty relations " between @entity2 and @entity7 to ease			1
and the sooner the better , for his business at least			0
" @entity7 tourism is changing the world , " @entity11 told a business audience in @entity0 last week and he wants a bigger slice of the action			1
along with other non-mining industries , @entity2 companies are looking beyond the pits , as the government 's new " @entity34 " policy urges the country to do			2
chief among the goals are that every child learn an @entity6 language -- in particular , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 or @entity43 -- and that they leave school having studied @entity6 culture by 2025			0
december marks 40 years of diplomatic relations between @entity2 and the @entity48 but as @entity11 and the @entity2 premier @entity49 similarly bemoan , @entity2 still tend to see @entity7 through a historical lens as predatory and alien with its cheap labor an abiding economic threat			1
and @entity2 is not alone , if the @entity56 rhetoric in the @entity58 presidential election is any indication			2
yet the disconnect between this attitude and the economic reality is wide			0
@entity7 remains @entity2 's number one trading partner			1
in 2010 - 11 , @entity7 was @entity2 's largest two - way trading partner for goods and services , with trade topping $ 113.3 billion , up 26 % on the previous year			1
@entity7 accounts for 14.7 % of the total trade of goods and services and takes one quarter of @entity2 exports			1
there 's little doubt the @entity2 economy is heavily reliant , some contend overly reliant , on @entity7 's doing well			1
but @entity76 , a fellow in economics at the @entity78 , says not even the recent slowing of the @entity7 economy is likely to impact negatively on @entity2 in the long term			1
" even as a short term slowing in @entity7 occurs , a lot of the long term projects particularly in infrastructure are locked in and that is what drives our demands , " @entity76 told @entity1			2
while trade in iron ore , coal and liquid natural gas largely dominates @entity2 exports to @entity7 , @entity76 sees a bigger and very different picture			1
" beyond commodities , engagement is deep and it 's probably the untold story , " he said			0
" there are architects like @entity99 building the @entity100 ( @entity101 ) in @entity102 or the former @entity104 employees at @entity105 setting up flight monitoring systems at @entity7 airports or the @entity2 aquarium building company ( @entity108 ) , which is creating @entity110 's first marine park , " said @entity76			1
" i think ties are expanding and deepening			0
the figure i see is that of small and medium sized ( @entity2 ) enterprises			2
they will go more to @entity7 than @entity115 and other traditional markets			2
" most agree a free trade agreement would help			0
negotiations are now in their eighth year with no deal in sight			0
former @entity2 prime minister and foreign minister @entity122 -- a @entity40 speaker with a deep but hard - nosed understanding of @entity7 -- told @entity1 he believes the agreement will happen			1
" these are matters which are highly sensitive on the @entity7 side			2
they have sensitivities about agriculture , and on the @entity2 side we want to ensure it is comprehensive and provides access for all manufacturers , not just resources and energy but includes the services sector , " he said			2
" under the new leadership their own economic future will be identified as requiring further reform - domestically in the @entity7 market and further with international market openings			2
this is essential to their growth model , " he told @entity1			0
the frequent outbursts of concern in @entity2 at the degree of @entity7 state investment in agricultural land and businesses ca n't help negotiations			1
figures are hard to come by , because only purchases above the a $ 244 million threshold require @entity2 government permission			2
but according to a 2011 report by the @entity161 and @entity162 , only 1 % of @entity2 agricultural businesses are part or fully owned by foreign interests and 44 million hectares of agricultural land are now wholly or partly owned by foreign entities			0
still , investments by @entity7 state - owned enterprises tend to make headlines across @entity2			1
there was concern when @entity171 invested hundreds of millions of dollars in thermal coal exploration licenses in @entity173			0
similarly , when @entity7 's largest diary producer , the state owned @entity175 snapped up a majority stake in @entity2 food manufacturer , @entity180 , eyebrows were raised			1
most recently , when the government green - lighted the sale of @entity2 's largest cotton farm , @entity187 in @entity188 , to a private @entity7 - @entity41 consortium , some in the coalition opposition called for the review threshold to be lowered and the decision to be reversed			1
@entity76 says the xenophobic tone of the debate is n't exclusive to @entity2			0
" that 's pretty commonplace around the world			0
i 've been in @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity115 , @entity198 and @entity199 , and i hear the same thing about @entity7 investment , " he said			0
" i do n't think the @entity7 understand the criticism and get very hurt by it , " he said			0
@entity122 says the critical issue is that @entity7 investment makes sense for both parties			0
" there are huge opportunities ( for @entity2 ) for direct sales into the @entity7 market			1
it takes two to tango for the @entity7 , " he told @entity1			0
still , the perception lingers that @entity2 has only nailed the basics for a strategic , profitable relationship with @entity7 , ruled by a party it is politely forbidden to criticize			1
differences on human rights issues -- in particular the fate of the @entity220 , the status of @entity221 and the way the @entity7 government deals more generally with dissent -- have often stymied relations			0
in 2008 , @entity122 looked to new regional diplomatic architecture to bridge the divide between economic necessity and understanding			0
however , his successor , @entity49 , appears to have ditched the idea of an @entity232 in which the @entity58 , @entity41 , @entity7 , @entity234 and @entity2 commune on political , economic and security matters in favor of a reinvigorated @entity237 , in which the @entity58 and @entity234 have observer status			1
@entity122 is sanguine about the impact of this on @entity2 -- @entity7 economic relations			1
" the mechanism is less important than the substance , " he said			0
" if you look at the level of economic engagement , it is already substantial			0
" the next step will hang on two things - the implementation of @entity7 's new growth model which will be implemented by the new leadership			2
the second is @entity2 's corporate leadership			1
government ca n't do everything , " he said			0
as @entity2 grapples with how best to deepen engagement , @entity7 looks to hit 7.5 % growth this year			1
the @entity260 predicts @entity7 will grow 7.8 % this year and hit 8.2 % growth in 2013			0
" we are hugging the panda , " he said			0
" ultimately @entity7 needs @entity2 for its food and energy needs			1
and increasingly it 's looking to @entity2 for professional services to urbanize its population and bring more people into the middle class			2
" and for @entity2 that means @entity7 will be a key player , " he said , before adding " but not only player			2

@entity2 's economy is increasingly tied to @entity7 , yet attitudes remain " cold *war* "
a recent white paper says @entity2 needs to embrace " the @entity279 " to thrive
@entity2 still tend to see @entity7 through a historical lens as predatory and alien
@entity7 is @entity2 's number one trade partner , helping @entity0 skirt the global *recession*
