-- a foreign minister clearly frustrated with some of his own countrymen has taken to @entity3 to expose some of the stranger requests received by consular staff			1
" can the government get involved if a @entity7 gets illegal sexual services overseas , but is not satisfied and wants a refund ? the answer seems obvious , " writes @entity10 , the country 's minster for foreign affairs , with an almost audible sigh			1
the exasperated minister went on to list other examples with the plea : " we have to draw the line between what is personal responsibility and what 's not			1
" where to draw the line ? personal responsibility could include the lovelorn citizen who asked the foreign office to convince his girlfriend to marry him			1
and then there was the @entity32 customer who alleged racial discrimination over the size of his fried chicken			1
" he wanted @entity36 to investigate this instance and seek justice in that foreign country for the unfair treatment he claimed to have received			0
we told him we could not do that , " the minister writes			0
nor could the country help the @entity7 living in @entity46 who requested the foreign office help ship a computer ordered online from the @entity50			2
@entity7 's consular officials handled 3,000 cases last year , filed by @entity7 who made some seven million trips abroad			1
that number is dwarfed by the volume of requests received by larger countries including the @entity58 , whose @entity59 ( @entity59 ) handled more than 52,000 cases the same year			0
it 's not just @entity7 in what seems to have become an annual warning to potential time - wasters , the @entity59 released a list last may of some of its most misdirected queries			2
they include the man who asked consular staff in @entity72 to translate a phrase for his new tattoo , and a woman who complained about the poor quality of football boots " made in @entity78			2
" so bizarre were some of the requests made to the foreign office in @entity82 that it was suggested the country consider charging a fee for consular assistance			2
in a policy brief , " @entity97 , " published in march 2013 , author @entity86 lays out the case for a charge , nothing that " expectations of what our diplomats can or should do for distressed travelers overseas are climbing , and in some cases becoming more unrealistic			0
" according to the report , some of the stranger requests to the @entity82 @entity99 ( @entity99 ) include : " will the sand in @entity102 upset my asthma ? " and " could dfat feed my dogs while i 'm away ? " in the past , @entity106 officials have also found the need to remind travelers of what they can and can not do			0
in 2011 , the then minister of foreign affairs @entity110 spelled it out in a press release : " consular officials can not ( her capitals ) : ask your mother - in - law to leave your house , purchase tickets for a musical or entertainment event , settle disputes between you and your partner ( and ) , pickup your dog at the airport			0
" you 've been warned .			0

@entity10 : " we have to draw a line between what is personal responsibility and what 's not "
