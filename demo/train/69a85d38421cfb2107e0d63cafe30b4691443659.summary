a similar test was carried out in november			0
@entity15 defense secretary @entity14 said he understood wednesday 's test of the missile , with an approximate range of 1,200 miles , was successful			1
state media reported that the missile , a @entity9 - 2 , was launched wednesday morning from the northern @entity1 city of @entity22 and reached its target			1
the report did not say where it landed			0
the missile was test - fired successfully , @entity1 president @entity27 told a group of residents in @entity22 province , state - run @entity26 reported			1
@entity27 said the missile " met the predetermined target , " according to the news agency			0
@entity14 said he could not confirm that it had hit the intended target			0
a @entity38 official said the test is noteworthy			0
" i think it is a significant technical development , " said @entity40 , special assistant to the president on nonproliferation , in a @entity44 speech wednesday			0
" of course , this is just a test , and obviously there is much work to be done before it can be built and deployed			0
but i see it as a significant step forward in terms of @entity1 's capacity to deliver weapons , " @entity40 said			2
" and i think it actually helps us in terms of making a case to countries like @entity59 , which were skeptical in the past whether @entity1 actually poses a threat			2
this is a very clear demonstration that @entity1 is moving in the direction of longer - range missiles			1
" an @entity66 official , meanwhile , said the test should be more of a concern to @entity8 than to @entity66 , since previous missiles tested by @entity1 could already reach the jewish state			1
" if anyone had any doubt , it is now clear that the @entity1 are playing with fire , " @entity66 deputy foreign minister @entity71 said wednesday in an interview on @entity73			1
" we know that the @entity1 are developing capabilities of thousands of kilometers , that could reach the coasts of the @entity15			1
" " the @entity1 clock is ticking fast and it must be stopped , " @entity71 said			2
@entity38 spokesman @entity84 said president @entity89 " expressed ... his great concern , his continued concern , about @entity1 's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and nuclear weapons technology			2
" the @entity9 is a new generation of surface - to - surface @entity1 - made missiles that " demonstrates a significant leap in @entity1 's missile capabilities , " @entity92 , the former director of @entity66 's @entity93 , told @entity97 after the november test			1
" regardless of the success of the test , this missile places @entity1 in the realm of multiple - stage missiles , which means that they are on the way to having intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities , " he said			2
@entity9 missiles are powered by solid fuel , which uses smaller containers and helps the rockets travel longer distances , president @entity27 told the semiofficial @entity113			1
@entity1 says the missiles have a range of almost 2,000 kilometers ( 1,243 miles )			2
if that is true , the missile brings @entity118 , @entity59 , @entity119 , @entity120 , and southern @entity121 within striking distance from @entity1 , according to @entity123 's , which provides information on defense issues			1
@entity14 said the missile was probably " on the low end of that range			0
" after the november launch , the @entity15 restated its objection to such tests , saying they violate @entity1 's obligations under @entity136 resolutions			2
@entity15 officials have cast doubt on the success of past missile test launches by @entity1 , including a rocket launch in august and a series of missile tests in july			1
wednesday 's reported test comes after @entity66 prime minister @entity145 met with @entity15 officials in @entity44 to discuss how to deal with the potential of a nuclear - armed @entity1			1
he met tuesday with the @entity148 , house speaker @entity149 and @entity38 minority leader @entity150			0
@entity89 , who met with @entity145 on monday , stuck by his refusal to commit to an " artificial deadline " for @entity1 negotiations on its nuclear program			2
but he also warned that he would not allow such talks , which he expects to accelerate after the @entity1 presidential election in june , to be used as an excuse for delay			0
he said the @entity15 is not " foreclosing a range of steps , including much stronger international sanctions , in assuring that @entity1 understands that we are serious			1
" @entity145 wanted a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions , with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached			0
asked if the missile launch will dampen @entity89 's efforts to reach out diplomatically to @entity1 , @entity84 said , " the president and the prime minister [ @entity145 ] both agreed on monday that engaging the people and the leaders of the @entity173 of @entity1 , something that has n't been tried for the past many years , is something that makes sense			2
" both @entity66 and the @entity15 believe that @entity1 is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program ; @entity0 denies the accusation			1
@entity66 leaders have pointed to @entity27 's calls for the end of @entity66 as a jewish state , and argue that quick action is needed			0
@entity145 called @entity1 the biggest threat to peace in the region			0
" if @entity1 were to acquire nuclear weapons , it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists , or worse , could actually give [ them ] nuclear weapons			0
and that would put us all in great peril , " he said			0
@entity89 is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the @entity199 and @entity200 world than @entity145			0
@entity2 's @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
