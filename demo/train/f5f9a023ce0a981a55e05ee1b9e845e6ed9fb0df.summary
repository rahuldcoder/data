-- @entity2 warplanes reportedly targeted @entity3 this week			1
scores of civilians were killed at markets and gas stations in @entity10 province tuesday , local leaders told @entity0			0
a militant group called @entity12 , the @entity13 in @entity3 and @entity2 , has been pushing into @entity3 , shaking the country , its leadership and , in turn , threatening the region			1
but what does it mean that @entity2 reportedly is now attacking its neighbor ? here are some answers to get you up to speed : what does @entity12 want , and how is that related to @entity3 and @entity2 ? @entity12 includes mostly @entity26 militants who want to create an @entity28 state across @entity26 areas of @entity3 and @entity2			1
in the towns it controls in @entity2 , it has imposed @entity33 law			2
women must be covered , music is prohibited , girls and boys must not mingle at school			0
the group 's tactics are so ruthless even @entity41 has distanced itself			0
for example , @entity12 kidnapped more than 140 @entity44 schoolboys in @entity2 last month and forced them to take daily lessons in radical @entity28 theory , according to the @entity47 , a @entity48 - based monitoring group			1
the militant group was born in @entity3 , initially called the @entity12 , an umbrella organization headed by @entity41			1
the group 's leader , @entity52 , served four years in a @entity54 prison camp for insurgents , at @entity56 in southern @entity3			2
he was released in 2009			0
the @entity13 in @entity3 relocated to @entity2 and eventually became known by its new name , the @entity13 in @entity3 and @entity2			1
is @entity12 capable of getting what it wants ? regrouping and strengthening in @entity2 , @entity12 became well - financed and highly organized			1
today , the group has grown large enough to divide the entire region along sectarian lines , experts say			0
@entity12 has produced and attracted more jihadists and foreign fighters than the war in @entity3 ever did			1
it has more suicide bombers at its disposal , more heavy weaponry and vehicles and more money than any other terrorist organization in the world			0
it also has launched an intensive and sophisticated media campaign with flashy videos directed at @entity76 , enticing them to join the fight			0
@entity12 has also employed a classic guerilla warfare tactic -- the militants live among civilians			2
it would be difficult to target these militants in general strikes without injuring or killing innocent people			0
why would @entity2 reportedly bomb @entity3 now ? @entity87 's regime knows where @entity12 bases are inside @entity2 , but its response to @entity12 has been fairly muted for months			1
the existence of @entity12 has helped to justify the @entity2 government 's often - used line that it is fighting " terrorists , " and opposition activists have long accused the regime of allowing the group to operate and grow , pointing to the government 's constant barrel bombing of civilian neighborhoods in places such as @entity102 , while @entity12 positions remain largely untargeted			1
but since the militant group has taken over large parts of northern @entity3 recently , @entity2 has intensified its targeted campaign of @entity12 positions , particularly in @entity107 , @entity2 , where @entity12 has operated its headquarters for some time			1
@entity109 denies bombing positions in @entity3 , but several sources , including an eyewitness and the head of the @entity10 provincial council , said @entity2 warplanes launched this week 's strikes			1
@entity0 is seeking a response from the @entity2 government			2
it 's unlikely @entity87 anticipated that @entity12 would achieve such impressive and significant victories in @entity3			1
the only weapon @entity2 have in the border area is air power ; @entity2 ground forces pulled out long ago			2
bombing @entity3 now serves to clip @entity12 ' wings a little			1
map : where @entity12 has taken control in @entity3 how are the @entity3 and @entity2 conflicts linked ? under @entity3 prime minister @entity130 , the @entity3 government has gradually become closer to the @entity2 regime			1
they share allies such as @entity134 and @entity135 and enemies such as @entity41 , @entity12 , @entity26 extremists and @entity138 , too			1
the old colonial borders in the region are disappearing , and a conflict is emerging that is more @entity26 versus @entity143			2
@entity130 , some experts said , stoked that sectarian tension even more in a speech wednesday in which the @entity143 leader slammed @entity26			2
he blamed his political rivals for " coordinating " the crisis in @entity3 and accused @entity26 of collaborating with militants			1
see : @entity130 changes tune on unity government what are the @entity3 military 's shortcomings ? @entity3 is using its air force -- what 's left of it -- to fight back against @entity12			1
@entity3 has initiated airstrikes , but targeting the group means putting a scope on constantly moving targets			2
@entity12 uses pickups , not tanks			2
without precise intelligence from the ground , battling @entity12 is tough			0
and it 's critical to remember that @entity3 lost virtually all its air power with the 2003 @entity54 invasion			0
the @entity3 army crumbled in the face of @entity12 ' advances			1
the governor of @entity173 told @entity0 that the @entity3 force is a " checkpoint army , " meaning that it is able to set up and run checkpoints but is n't sophisticated enough to fight @entity12 cells			1
the @entity3 army also tends to use a counterproductive strategy of rounding up individuals as a method of control , aggravating the local population			0
finally , the @entity3 military is up against a terror organization more powerful than anything that the @entity54 military was battling and struggled to overcome			0
why has @entity54 air power not been used against @entity12 in @entity3 ? many experts believe that @entity54 airstrikes in @entity3 are far too risky and might not deliver the results the @entity54 wants			1
again , consider that @entity12 is mixed among the civilian population			0
airstrikes may kill innocent people			0
and there are logistical questions that have to be answered			0
where would the air power come from ? bases in @entity199 perhaps ? would @entity199 give its green light ? also , some in @entity3 perceive that the @entity54 put @entity130 in power and supported his regime for years , and @entity54 interference with air power might not be welcomed			2
the @entity54 has to worry about @entity134 , too			0
@entity54 strikes in @entity3 could undermine progress @entity134 and the @entity54 have made on the issue of nuclear weapons			0
also , @entity12 is not the only group fighting to gain control of @entity3			1
@entity26 insurgent groups that were active during the @entity54 - led invasion have also joined in the battle			0
@entity26 tribal leaders all oppose @entity130 and view him and his @entity143 - dominated government as a bigger threat to the country than @entity12			2
members of insurgent groups not aligned with @entity12 could be killed , possibly creating a new set of enemies			0
any @entity54 airstrikes in @entity3 could further deepen the divide if there 's a perception the action was done to bolster @entity130 's government			0
it could also further alienate @entity26 groups whose support eventually will be needed for any sort of political process to succeed in the country			0
op - ed : how @entity12 threatens the wider world @entity0 's @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
