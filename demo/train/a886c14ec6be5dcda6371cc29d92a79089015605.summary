@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 aircraft launched more than a dozen strikes on the @entity1 capital early tuesday , and smoke could be seen rising from the area near @entity1 leader @entity10 's @entity9 in @entity0			1
the @entity4 attack , one of the heaviest against @entity0 since the @entity4 mission began just over two months ago , started at about 1 a.m. and lasted more than 20 minutes , with alliance jets circling overhead and @entity1 loyalist forces responding with anti-aircraft fire			1
@entity17 , a @entity1 government spokesman , said the attack targeted a guard compound for @entity20 military volunteers that had been emptied in anticipation			1
