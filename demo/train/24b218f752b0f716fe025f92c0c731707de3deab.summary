" let me hear a duck skydiving , " said casting director @entity15			1
" @entity21 ! " cried @entity17 , 54 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , in her most terrified duck voice			1
one by one , the hopefuls waddled through , putting their ducks in a row as much as one can for a job limited by one bird and his one word			1
the contenders were allowed to grunt , groan and mutter , but their only word began with " a " and rhymed with quack			2
they quacked shy , shrill , scared and silly			0
recorders rolled as the wannabes channeled their inner ducks to quack like a duck in love ... a duck answering the phone ... a duck singing about being in love ... a duck on a wire ... a duck flying by ... a duck getting bad news ... another duck in love			1
ducks fearful and ducks overjoyed			1
@entity54 , 42 , of @entity0 did n't wait for a prompt to let loose her quackery			0

@entity11 plans to screen about 1,000 live auditions and 12,000 online submissions , with the company 's new duck scheduled to quack out a new ad later this month			1
the duck , said company spokesman @entity80 , perches high on @entity11 's organizational chart			1
" everyone is secondary to the duck because the duck is such an amazing campaign , " he said			2

" several wannabes compared the odds of getting the job of official squawker to the odds of winning the lottery			0

the last interview for @entity114 -- a roofing contractor in @entity116 , @entity1 -- was when he was 18			0
the 61 - year - old contestant calmed his pre-quack jitters by rehearsing in front of his grandchildren with a duck puppet			1
" it might sound corny , but this job would let me do some landscaping around my church that we do n't have the funding to take care of , " he said			0
the high stakes prompted @entity130 , 44 , to pop peppermints to keep her gullet from quacking hoarse			2
after her audition , she admitted her work experience with ducks was limited			2
" other than feed them and seeing the water roll off their back , that 's about it , " she said			0
