-- the story so far : @entity3 teen @entity2 falls in love with @entity5 , a mysteriously aloof , fair - skinned but exceedingly well - educated young man who confesses to being a " vegetarian " vampire			1
this bums out @entity2 's best friend , @entity8 , who has always carried a torch for her , and who has a natural aversion to vampires , being a werewolf himself			1
despite his better ( and worse ) instincts , @entity5 is smitten , and eventually he agrees to marry her			1
at the end of " @entity18 " she gives birth to their half - human child , but nearly dies during labor			2
in order to save @entity2 's life , @entity5 has to " turn " his bride into an immortal -- which is what she wanted all along			2
still with us ? " @entity18 - part 2 , " the fifth and final film in " @entity29 " begins with @entity2 waking up to enjoy her freshly sharpened senses , her attractive red eyes and vampiric super-strength			1
and the first , most pressing question on everybody 's mind is this : will she eat the baby ? @entity5 whisks her off into the woods to quench her thirst , where the question becomes : will @entity2 eat @entity42 ? and then a third time : will she eat the anonymous climber scaling a sheer rock face oblivious to the real danger he is in ? teen movies have sure come a long way since " @entity50			2
" back then , all we wanted was to find common ground and fit in			2
mind you , once her sanguinary and carnal appetites have been satisfied , assimilation is also @entity2 's main concern			0
life after ' twilight ' : readers pick new teams it exhibits along the lines of : what to tell dad ? and what to do about the wolfboy who has marked out her newborn -- but fast - growing -- daughter as his intended ? ( " you nicknamed my baby after the @entity72 ? ! " ) it has taken this series a long time to line up its dominoes , but " @entity18 -- part 2 " is easily the freakiest film in the saga , and the most fun			1
before we 're done there will be a virtual @entity83 of vampire delegates -- associates from the @entity86 , from @entity87 , the @entity88 , from @entity89 and , yes , @entity90 , converging on @entity91 and getting a chance to bond with @entity93 before the ultimate showdown with their eminences , the @entity97			0
these cloaked archvillains have been waiting in the wings so long it 's a wonder they have n't taken off , but at last @entity101 's got the chance to act -- show these young pretenders how it 's done -- and he does n't waste a single voluptuous syllable			0
in one extraordinary moment he lets rip with what can only be described as a squeal			0
it 's a performance @entity110 would love , and @entity111 could only envy -- there can be no higher praise			0
share your review of ' @entity116 ' the battle , when it comes , is exciting and almost ludicrously grisly			0
even @entity120 ( maybe especially @entity120 ) will enjoy the kind of carnage normally associated with the worst excesses of the @entity124			0
directed , like the last film , by @entity126 , and not at all ashamed of wearing its big pulpy heart on its sleeve , " @entity133 " is enjoyably demented , a rousing curtain call and quite enough to tide us over until @entity134 's " @entity136 " reaches our screens next march .			1

" breaking @entity138 *---* part 2 " is the fifth and final @entity140 film
critic says movie is " easily the freakiest film in the saga , and the most fun "
@entity126 returns to direct as he did the last movie
