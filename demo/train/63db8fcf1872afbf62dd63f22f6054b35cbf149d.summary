@entity0 -- @entity2 of @entity3 has been photographed furtively once again : an @entity5 magazine announced tuesday it will publish vacation photos of the pregnant royal and her baby bump , despite her objection			1
the magazine , @entity10 , said tuesday that it will print " extraordinary images of the @entity13 and @entity14 during their dream holiday in the @entity16 " in the issue coming out wednesday			1
" the future mum , now in her fourth month of pregnancy , wears a small bikini that enhances her now visible bump , " the magazine said			1
@entity22 -- which represents @entity23 , her husband , prince @entity25 , and his brother , @entity27 -- responded with dismay			1
" we are disappointed that photographs of the @entity13 and @entity14 on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas , " a palace representative said			1
" this is a clear breach of the couple 's right to privacy			0
" it was not immediately clear when or exactly where the pictures were taken			0
@entity40 and @entity41 media -- including @entity42 , like @entity1 a division of @entity44 -- reported that the royal couple recently vacationed on the secluded @entity16 isle of @entity47			0
@entity2 , whose maiden name is @entity14 , has kept a low profile since the announcement in december she is set to give birth to her first child in july			0
images showing any evidence of a baby bump have been hard to come by in that time			2
the @entity10 photos , though , are not her first encounter with paparazzi -- which tracked her during her long courtship with @entity25 , their engagement and their time since april 2011 as a married couple			2
the highest - profile example came in september 2012 , when the @entity66 magazine closer ran photographs of @entity23 privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with @entity25 in @entity66			1
besides that magazine , some of those photos also were published in the @entity73 newspaper and @entity10 , which according to its parent company @entity74 is a women 's magazine with an average circulation of more than 218,000 and a readership well beyond that			2
soon after the photos came out , the @entity13 and @entity14 took legal action against @entity65 -- which was fined by a @entity66 court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online			2
it was also told to hand over the photos to the royals			0
@entity1 's @entity87 reported this story from @entity0 , and @entity89 wrote it from @entity90			0
@entity1 's @entity91 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity5 magazine , @entity10 , says it will print photos of the @entity14 on holiday
the photos show her in " a small bikini that enhances her now visible ( baby ) bump , " @entity10 says
a disappointed @entity22 says the pics violate her privacy
@entity10 was among the publications to *run* photos of @entity23 sunbathing topless last year
