-- post-traumatic stress disorder begins as a natural response to danger , according to psychiatrists			1
@entity5 says her life had been the stuff of nightmares			1
she reached out to @entity10 psychiatrist dr. @entity9 in 2005 after suffering the effects of ptsd for years and trying various treatments , to no avail			1
" my mom was 19 when she had me , and she was very ill - equipped , " @entity5 said			1
but the worst arrived when @entity5 was 4 years old and her mother went on vacation , leaving her with a male friend who 'd agreed to babysit			1
as it turned out , says @entity5 , he was a pedophile who raped her repeatedly over the six - week stretch that her mother was gone			1
when they finally reunited , her mother noticed a change			1
" she told me , ' i just wondered why you were kind of withdrawn and were n't the happy child you used to be , ' " @entity5 said			1
but the angry , bewildered child did n't tell tell her mother what had happened , and no one put the pieces together			2
not long after , @entity5 went to live with her grandmother in @entity31 , where she did well in school and became accustomed to a " normal " life			1
read the first installment of this three - part series but five years later , another catastrophe struck -- literally			2
she was hit by a delivery truck as she was riding her bike to a dance lesson			2
as it was , she needed two reconstructive surgeries on her face and was partially paralyzed for four months			2
the 11 - year - old found strength in stoicism			2
' " that was good and bad			2
i mean , it was heartbreaking to be a kid like that , " she said			2
" to realize , there 's not gon na be a magical fairy that shows up			2
' bad news , kid , no one 's saving you			2
' and that was a big turning point			2
" seemingly against all odds , she pulled her body and mind back together			2
she became fascinated by notions of human potential , the way the mind works			2
and she asked herself the big questions			2
" i wanted to make sense of it all			2
" it took years , however , to reach out to @entity9			1
her plan : to see whether she could free herself from torment by taking a drug called @entity74 , commonly known as @entity74			1
party drug and forbidden substance the compound known as 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , or @entity74 , was first synthesized in @entity79 in 1912			1
no one quite knew what to do with it			2
it was studied by the military in the 1950s and eventually emerged from the lab in the late 1970s			0
the first report on its effect in humans was published in 1978 by independent chemist @entity89 and @entity90 , a professor of pharmacology at @entity92			0
at the same time , @entity89 was churning out the drug in his lab and sharing it with a handful of psychiatrists and therapists who saw @entity74 as a lever for human growth			1
dr. @entity100 helped @entity89 make an early batch and offered it to interested couples and individuals			1
" @entity74 reduced the fear response , so people could talk about the things that made them afraid or upset , " he recalled			1
at the same time , " people were able to have normal cognitive function , and the insights they had were able to translate to everyday life			0
" a few people had mild panic attacks , says @entity100 , " but in general , it was well - tolerated			0
" he described his experiments in a paper , detailing the experiences of 29 people			0
not everyone was so careful			0
by the mid- ' 80s , @entity74 was also in use as a party drug			1
in the spring of 1985 , the alarm was sounding , and @entity74 was making headlines			1
@entity126 held hearings , and the @entity128 put @entity74 on the list of forbidden substances alongside heroin and @entity132			1
the uproar left the small community of @entity74 therapists shaken			1
@entity100 submitted testimony asserting the drug 's safety to the @entity128 , but to little avail			0
@entity140 , a soon - to - be @entity141 graduate student who would later found the @entity142 -- a group wanting to turn mind - altering drugs like @entity74 into prescription medicine -- saw the writing on the wall			1
shortly before @entity74 was banned , he persuaded @entity147 to synthesize two kilograms for researchers , for the cost of materials			1
" doing science that gets reported , that 's an idea we can sort of leverage , " @entity140 said			0
to win broader acceptance for @entity74 -- and for cousins like lsd and psilocybin , the mind - altering compound in so - called magic mushrooms -- " the medical route was the only route			1
" that meant a formal plan for drug development : study protocols , institutional review boards and the rest			0
@entity9 , a @entity170 - trained clinician who specializes in trauma and had a long - running interest in @entity74 , was the perfect partner			1
before taking @entity5 's call , @entity9 had spent nearly three years navigating the federal bureaucracy to win approval for his small experiment , designed to test a simple question : is @entity74 , used in a clinical setting , safe ? ' i got to survive			1
but for what ? ' as a teenager , @entity5 marched with a precocious sense of purpose			1
at age 13 , she moved across the country to live with family friends in @entity186			0
a year later , she was back in @entity187 , where she found a full - time secretarial job while completing her high school coursework			0
she built a strong relationship with her father , who had separated from her mother when she was an infant			0
by the time she was 17 , she was back with her mom but supporting herself financially			0
she was wary of relationships but wanted a family , and at 19 she found a like - minded colleague who agreed to co-parent a son			0
they moved to @entity201 , because she had fond memories of a childhood vacation			1
" i think there was a part of me that thought i could run away from all that crazy horrible stuff , " she said			1
" i was trying to find ways to be okay			0
" but the peace was fragile			0
when her father died in 1991 , @entity5 became so depressed , she fell into a stupor			1
she was hospitalized , and for the first time , a psychiatrist listened as she talked about her childhood abuse			1
it was eye - opening , but therapy offered limited relief			0
she grew well enough to leave the hospital but found little joy outside			0
in 1998 , she suffered another breakdown after learning from a friend that the man who 'd sexually abused her was under investigation for molesting another girl			1
under the weight of stress and emotion , @entity225 's carefully constructed shell began to crack			0
" i started having these outrageous flashbacks , and body memories , " she recalled			0
" the first time , i thought someone slipped me a drug			0
because it would be these unstoppable , full - body blackout memories , and people would tell me later , ' you were just screaming for an hour			0
' " she stopped sleeping			0
her stomach problems worsened ; she vomited every time she ate			0
once again , she checked herself into the hospital			0
once again , it was all the doctors could do just to tape the pieces back together			0
" i became like a survival machine			0
and i 'm kind of blessed , because i did n't become violent or hostile or self - destructive , " she said			0
at the same time , a " normal " life felt out of reach			0
" it was kind of like , ' ok , i got to survive			0
but for what ? ' " to be continued in monday 's story			0
