-- there are no good or easy solutions for @entity4 policy toward @entity5 , and short - sighted arguments about military aid miss the broader issues entirely			1
@entity4 is relearning the lesson of the 1950s post-colonial period : democracy depends on stable and experienced political parties and leaders , a willingness to compromise rather than conspire and to share or give up power until the next election			1
@entity17 without that experience might hold elections , but such hollow exercises in democracy too often become little more than preludes to bitter power struggles and existential matters of survival for the factions involved			0
the @entity27 administration did what it could in spite of these realities			0
it 's becoming public that top @entity4 officials did try to broker a settlement and avoid this			0
the @entity35 worked with the @entity36 , the @entity17 and key @entity38 states like @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41			0
it soon found , however , that @entity5 's military chief @entity43 and ousted president @entity44 were on a collision course , and no real democratic center , no mix of leaders and experience , was at the ready to make democracy work			1
the @entity5 military has shown in blood that it believes it can not co-exist with the @entity53			2
gen. @entity43 may or may not emerge as the formal leader of @entity5 , but there is no way for him and the @entity5 military to compromise with @entity44 and the @entity53			0
the military also has no need to compromise with @entity5 's divided liberal factions and political leaders like @entity61			1
@entity5 's more liberal and secular voices may soon learn they can not be independent in an era of military rule			0
as the @entity4 learned when it occupied @entity66 from 2003 to 2011 , it has little leverage to force any side to change its behavior			0
opinion : @entity71 , do n't end , @entity4 aid to @entity5 the debate over calling the @entity5 power a struggle a " coup " has been nothing more than a sideshow			1
the @entity5 military has more than enough @entity4 - supplied weapons -- f - 16s and @entity82 tanks -- to wait out any cut or suspension in @entity4 aid			1
@entity5 also has no meaningful conventional military threat to its existing forces			0
the camp david peace accords have secured a cold peace for @entity5 as well as @entity90			0
president @entity27 canceled the @entity4 military 's participation in next month 's @entity93 in @entity5 -- but this was inevitable for other reasons			1
the @entity5 military is fighting a low - level civil war against @entity38 opponents in the @entity98 -- a key location for the exercise -- and @entity5 's military could scarcely carry out a massive military exercise and seize control of the country at the same time , any more than the @entity4 could deploy troops into the middle of an ongoing power struggle			2
losing an annual $ 1.3 billion in @entity4 aid or facing a delay in the delivery of f - 16s is far less significant to @entity5 's military than controlling the country and ensuring its own survival			1
besides , the @entity5 military learned well over a month ago that it had other sources of decisive support			0
@entity5 protester : why we are willing to die as the @entity53 largely stood on the sidelines , the military removed @entity44 from power on july 3 with the support of many of the same protesters who had originally brought down @entity123			0
by july 9 , key powers like @entity39 and the @entity41 determined the threat of the @entity53 controlling @entity5 , or of @entity5 descending into political turmoil , was worth an offer of $ 8 billion in aid to avoid			2
at this point , some officials in the @entity4 might be momentarily satisfied by formally calling the actions of @entity5 's military a " coup , " but it would be little more than an exercise in hollow symbolism			2
it also potentially deprives the @entity4 of much of the little leverage it has			0
the @entity5 military knows the @entity4 needs @entity5 as much as @entity5 needs the @entity4 @entity5 plays a key role in dealing with threats like @entity141 , securing @entity90 and key @entity38 allies , supporting missions like the @entity145 conflict , countering terrorism , and securing the flow of world oil exports and the global economy			2
what the @entity4 must do is to show strategic patience : it must accept the real world character of large - scale revolutions in states with no history of democracy or political base to make it work			1
the @entity4 needs to accept that @entity5 is undergoing a power struggle that will take years to play out before real and stable democracy is possible			1
it needs to send in an experienced ambassador like @entity161 and reinforce a country team of diplomats and @entity4 military			2
it needs its senior officials and top military officers to do everything possible to persuade the @entity5 military to halt the killing and limit its future repression			0
more broadly , the @entity4 needs to make a lasting commitment to patiently working with every possible ally both inside and outside @entity5 to create the kind of political forces , financial incentives , and compromises that can limit future upheavals and violence and lay the groundwork for lasting political change			1
the @entity4 can not create instant democracy from the outside by constant diplomatic pressure , but it may be able to help , over time , move @entity5 toward political reform from within			1
refocusing @entity4 aid to slowly push @entity5 's military toward compromise and restraint , building up @entity5 's more secular and liberal forces , and making it clear that the @entity4 supports the role of @entity5 's moderate @entity192 , offers no guarantees , but they are the best real world options available			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : democracy needs experienced political parties and leaders
@entity197 : @entity5 had no real democratic center at the ready to make democracy work
cutting off @entity4 aid to @entity5 wo n't be that significant to the military , @entity197 writes
he says the @entity4 needs to help develop democracy that comes from within @entity5
