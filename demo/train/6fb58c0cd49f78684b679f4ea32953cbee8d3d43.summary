@entity0 -- the @entity2 approved new rules wednesday to further limit automatically dialed or prerecorded calls know as " robocalls " and automated text messages			1
the @entity2 's rules go beyond @entity9 rules that have been in force since 2008			2
" too many telemarketers , aided by autodialers and prerecorded messages , have continued to call consumers who do n't want to hear from them , " said @entity2 chairman @entity11 in a statement read at the meeting			1
these new overlapping rules seek to close loopholes in the existing regulations			0
under the new requirements , telemarketers will have to get permission in writing before placing an automated call to a consumer			2
previously , companies that had an established business relationship with a particular consumer could call them without permission			2
for example , another @entity2 official not authorized to speak publicly explained , a bank could robocall one of its checking account customers to try to sell them insurance			0
the new rules prohibit that without written permission			0
information calls , such as school closing information and flight cancellations , are an exception			0
they can be made to land - line phones without written permission			0
text messages and calls to cell phones are subject to stricter rules			0
" any type of phone call or text to a wireless device needs written consent , " the @entity2 official added			2
telemarketers also will be required to let consumers easily prevent any future calls			0
" each and every telemarketing robocall will have to include an automated , interactive opt - out mechanism , so that a consumer can revoke consent by pressing just a few keys during the call , " @entity11 said			1
the company will have to immediately disconnect the call and add you to their do - not - call list			0
" dead air " calls also are restricted by the new rules			1
some telemarketers place many calls at once guessing how many people will answer the phone ; if more people answer than there are operators , the result on the receiver 's end is often the silence of a delayed response			0
the new rules " strictly " limit the number of such calls telemarketers can make " within each calling campaign , " the @entity2 said			1
a telemarketing company that has a real person dialing the phone numbers is not subject to the new rules			1
" @entity90 ' first line of protection against any call is the do - not - call list , " the @entity2 official said			1
consumers can sue companies who violate these rules , the @entity2 official explained , adding , " we also take action based on trends of complaints			1

new : rules address " continued " robocalls , @entity2 chairman @entity11 says
new : robocalls include an automated , interactive opt - out feature , he says
also limited are " dead air " calls in which no one is on the line when the call is answered
rules do not apply to companies that have a real person dialing the number
