editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " journey from the @entity4 : a girlhood caught in @entity6			1
" her web site is http://www.royahakakian.com/live /			2
@entity2 says she lived through an earlier moment when @entity9 thought freedom was at hand			1
( @entity12 ) -- since last saturday , the images of @entity14 , the young woman who died on the streets of @entity17 , keep playing before my eyes			2
when i do n't look at the clip on my computer , it runs on its own in my mind 's eye			2
what has me so riveted is not entirely empathy , the intuitive human response the images are bound to stir in everyone			0
there is also something less noble at work in me , an obsession with seeing my own face upon hers			0
each time i see her die , i die along with her			0
i , too , was born and raised in @entity6			1
my coming - of - age years coincided with the @entity9 revolution of 1979			1
@entity40 , too , was on the streets , watching and rooting for the demonstrators			0
nothing seemed more natural , more compelling than being on the streets , calling for freedom , breathing the intoxicating , the dangerously euphoric @entity17 air			2
i was 12 in 1978 , yet i was as undaunted as any adult			0
nothing , least of all my pleading parents , could keep me away from the rooftops at 9 p.m. amid the night 's dark , where the crowds were as indiscernible as ghosts , the shouts of " allah - o - akbar " rose from every rooftop like smoke rising from an invisible bonfire			0
we were all victims of the flames and the very arsonists at once			0
we were burning in the fire of our own making			0
thirty years hence that fire still burns in @entity6 , because moments before her death , @entity14 cried : " i 'm on fire ! " i am entranced by her because she and i are the only two possibilities of the dictatorial narrative : death or escape			1
and because i live i can not escape her death -- the memory of her large eyes languidly drifting to one side , then freezing upon the abyss			0
survival of this kind brings its own eternal damnation : a bifurcated existence lived in the here and now , but perpetually haunted by there and then			0
making peace with the past would have been easier , if only the essence of that past had not been in doubt , if its dignity were intact			0
but in my first @entity92 ride in my first @entity92 taxi cab , i learned the staggering counter-narrative that i would hear again and again , dominating the western perceptions of @entity6 , when the driver asked : " so , where are you from ? " " i come from @entity6 , " i said , in broken @entity98			1
" @entity101 , " he asked with uncertainty			0
" eeeran ? " then passing his fingertips across his throat like a knife , he said , " @entity105 ... @entity106 ? " in that , 2,500 years of civilization was reduced to one vile name and the invocation of a throat being slit			0
it did not take long for me to learn that between the @entity6 that i knew and the @entity9 that @entity92 knew was a discrepancy as vast as the waters that separated us			1
i soon learned that the images of a fist - throwing mob of angry men and darkly veiled women burning the @entity122 effigies were the only images that most @entity92 had of @entity6			1
those images had little in common with the @entity6 i knew -- greater in numbers and in the grip of the same fist - throwing crowds			1
with @entity128 's death , the @entity6 i know finally has a face			1
the sequence of her death is the sequence of our nation 's struggle in the past 30 years : the democratic future that 1979 was to deliver collapsing , then trails of blood -- that of so many executed or assassinated -- streaming across its bright promise			2
the film of @entity128 's death is the abbreviated history of contemporary @entity6			1
if history is a contest among competing narratives and icons , let the image of a young woman lying on the ground endure as that of @entity6 today			1
let it loom so large to wipe away the memory of the thugs marching @entity92 hostages out of the @entity154 in @entity17			0
let the scarf that loosens and falls off her head to expose her dark hair be emblazoned in our memories as the metaphor for the plight of @entity6 's women			1
as if her death were not tragic enough , the authorities have banned all mosques throughout @entity17 from holding prayer services for @entity128			2
silence in the face of such inhumanity is a sin as great as the one a war could spur			0
this friday evening throughout @entity6 , people will be lighting candles in memory of @entity128 and others who have died in the past few days			1
here in the @entity92 , i hope you join me and thousands of my compatriots in a memorial campaign for @entity128 by asking your religious and spiritual leaders to include a prayer for @entity128 and other fallen @entity9 of the recent days in this week 's services			1
for 30 years , @entity6 's regime has appropriated @entity185			2
let us reclaim @entity185 from those who deny a family the right to properly mourn the death of their child through our prayers and help bring peace to a tormented nation			0
