@entity0 , @entity1 -- if the opening game of the @entity4 was anything to go by , in which @entity1 played out a compelling 1 - 1 draw with their @entity9 opponents @entity10 , the power of soccer has managed to pull off an early victory			1
football -- known locally as @entity15 -- has traditionally been a " black " sport in this region , so it was remarkable that of the 84,490 people that attended the match played on the outskirts of @entity23 , so many were non-colored and , more specifically , white			1
prior to kick - off , organizers had been vocal about their primary goal ; to leave a legacy of greater unity between a people that had been divided for so much of their shared history			2
historical paranoia and mistrust between racial groups had been rekindled in the republic as recently as april , when white supremacist leader @entity35 was murdered in his farmhouse home			1
@entity38 , a freelance football expert who writes for the @entity40 newspaper , told @entity2 : " after the @entity35 murder , people were predicting a civil war and bloodshed -- but that just has n't materialized			1
" people have put aside their differences , people on the streets are just smiling a lot more and the economic problems and racial divisions have been forgotten			0
" @entity53 , editor of @entity55 newspaper in @entity1 , agreed with @entity57 's analysis : " i think over the past month we 've seen a crossing of racial boundaries that people did not think was possible after the murder of @entity35 put us on the edge of a race war			1
people have really shown the enormous human capacity of reaching out to find what is common			0
" though the organizers seemingly have reason to be pleased with the early progress made towards their goals , @entity53 told @entity2 the credit should not fall at the feet of world football 's governing body @entity75 or the @entity1 government			1
" i would n't attribute this to the organizers at all			0
what surprises me is this really does seem to have come from the ground			0
forced attempts to make us reconcile -- where we 're told to hold hands , to cross racial boundaries -- never work			1
but people have taken this @entity89 into their own hands and made it their own			1
" such views held by those in the domestic media certainly seemed to hold weight with the views of fans that spoke to @entity2 as they left the @entity99 after the game			0
@entity101 ( white ) , 24 , who works as a buyer in @entity0 said : " @entity104 has united @entity1 because normally we think that white people do n't come to see soccer -- but today it was everyone together			1
" @entity109 is normally white and soccer black , but a couple of weeks a go an @entity113 rugby team from @entity114 played at the [ @entity116 ] @entity115 [ in @entity23 ] -- and they had their vuvuzelas ! it has been amazing some of the things that have happened			1
" @entity120 , a 59 - year - old white office worker added : " this was my first football game in @entity1			1
we came by train , which is traditionally transport for the black community but it was superb , we had an absolute ball and i would come again definitely			2
" i think the community will mingle after the @entity89 a bit more after this			2
i think that is far more important than economic benefit			0
a debt can be paid off but a community spirit is priceless			0
" forty - one - year - old attorney , @entity134 ( @entity135 ) added : " nights like tonight help to bring us together , from a people aspect the @entity89 has been a big plus			2
i 'm an @entity135 , but i 'm a @entity1 first			2
" @entity142 ( black ) , a 35 - year - old senior manager at @entity145 department of finance was already a regular spectator at domestic league games prior to the @entity89			1
he too welcomed a soccer crowd that better reflected @entity1 's diverse population			2
" the crowd [ for the first game ] had far more whites and @entity135 , it was very multiracial unlike the normal crowd which is mostly black			2
most non-black football fans in @entity1 worry about the security			1
" for @entity142 , the key to maintaining the momentum created in the build up to the @entity89 is for football , as a sport , to be more proactive in its promotion ; an action that could have benefits for the society more widely			1
" we have to sell soccer in all communities , we need the white fans to go back and promote football in the white schools so that we can have more white players coming through to play			0
" we have to progress -- i saw apartheid -- but my generation will fade away the new generations will come the stadiums together in the future , " he told @entity2			0
ever since the " @entity183 " was announced as the hosts of @entity75 's showpiece in 2004 , skeptics argued that areas in desperate need of investment and their resources were forsaken for the tournament			0
new stadiums were built at vast expense for a nation where over 40 percent of the population lives on two dollars a day			0
for many the key to creating a legacy will be how the good start to the @entity89 is built on			2
" i think it 's unrealistic to expect more than a feel - good factor			0
once the @entity89 is done and when the " white - elephant " stadiums are left i do n't think you can expect sport to unite the people on a permanent basis , " @entity57 told @entity2			1
" you 're still going to have people dissatisfied about living in poor conditions , the massive disparity between bosses and workers , and racial divides			1
" @entity53 added : " our national statistics show that black ownership of key levers of the economy and presence in management layers still has a long way to go			0
the income gap has still two generations to work on becoming closer			0
" [ however ] the value of events that can bring the nation together , it is hard to put a price on that			0
it 's the first time we 've felt this kind of nationhood since 1994			0
" but i would caution against building miracle moments because -- when you look at how feudal some parts of @entity1 still is , when there is another murder of a farmer , or a farmer kills his workers -- it is easy for this to turn to a failure			1
" better to look at the small things , where people are reaching out to be friends , to fall in love and to marry -- this is the key progress			0
the hard work starts in july when the tournament packs up			0

the @entity89 is *bridging* traditional racial divides in @entity1
many @entity1 whites are attending football matches -- traditionally a " black " sport
racial unity allays fears recent killing of @entity35 would rekindle *clashes*
