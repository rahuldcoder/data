@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal judge wednesday entered " not guilty " pleas on behalf of @entity5 , the @entity1 man accused of fatally shooting six people and wounding 13 others , including @entity9 rep. @entity8			1
judge @entity10 also scheduled a may 25 competency hearing for @entity5 , and attorneys on both sides will be allowed to hire their own experts to evaluate @entity5 's competency to stand trial			1
prosecutors sought the competency hearing , saying that @entity5 had believed the @entity19 was bugging him , had extreme animosity toward the government , and was even hearing voices			1
@entity5 's public defenders did n't want such a hearing , saying it would be premature and could interfere with their ability to develop a relationship with @entity5			1
but the judge said his review of materials relating to @entity5 left him concerned			2
" we ca n't do anything until i 'm assured that mr. @entity5 is on board and able to assist " in his own defense , the judge ruled			2
last thursday , a federal grand jury returned a new indictment against @entity5 in which he is charged on 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting outside a @entity0 supermarket in january			1
@entity5 , 22 , entered the courtroom with a slight grin , the first time he 's appeared in a @entity0 courtroom			1
his bald head is now showing growing hair			0
when a clerk asked if his name was @entity5 , he responded : " yes , it is			2
" the judge entered the " not guilty " pleas for @entity5 at his attorneys ' request			1
@entity5 waived the reading of all 49 charges against him			1
in response to motions , the judge ordered prosecutors to release grand jury materials to the defense , but said @entity5 's attorneys can not reproduce the documents or leave copies with @entity5			1
@entity10 also ordered the release of findings from authorities ' search of @entity5 's parents ' home in @entity0 , as requested by two @entity1 media outlets			1
last month , the judge sided with prosecutors in withholding the information because the investigation was ongoing and a grand jury was still preparing an indictment			0
but with a new indictment now issued , the judge said it is time to unseal the documents relating to what was found in the @entity83 home			0
" the active investigation is over , " the judge said			0
" ninety percent of the information in the warrant domain is already in the public light			0
" he added , " there is something mystic and suspicious in not releasing this type of information			0
" @entity10 said he will delay ruling on a motion filed by prosecutors monday to force @entity5 to submit a handwriting sample -- a request that he , thus far , has refused			1
the government wants the sample to compare with handwritten notes found in @entity5 's residence that include mentions of @entity8 " as well as references to guns and bullets , " according to a court document			1
it says he has resisted such requests to date , " arguing that the court lacks authority " to force him to provide a sample			0
" there being no other avenue to obtain the defendant 's handwriting exemplar , the government now seeks an order to compel , " prosecutors wrote in the motion			2
@entity10 said he wants to discuss some material collected by bureau of prisons on @entity5 since he was arrested			0
prosecutors said they want the court to review the materials , to see if they should be able to see it			0
but @entity5 's public defenders said they want time to review the matter and prepare arguments in writing			1
as the hearing unfolded and the judge made his decisions , @entity5 sat still			2
the full courtroom included about 20 family members of victims and seven people supporting @entity5 , including a woman who dabbed her eyes with tissue			0
among the spectators were @entity139 , one of two men who jumped on @entity5 and subdued him during the shooting , and shooting victim @entity143			2
also attending was @entity144 , who was wounded in the attack and whose husband , @entity146 , a retired construction worker , died trying to shield his wife from the bullets			0
@entity5 's family members declined to comment as they left the courthouse			1
@entity0 attorney @entity151 , who appeared in court on behalf of slain federal judge @entity153 and his family , was asked by reporters afterward what he thought of seeing @entity5 face - to - face			1
responded @entity151 : " he 's just another defendant			0
" @entity5 was earlier indicted on three counts of attempted murder , including one alleging that he tried to kill @entity8 with a @entity160 semiautomatic handgun during the event she was hosting for constituents			0
@entity8 , who was shot in the head , is undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in @entity166			0
the new indictment supersedes the earlier one			0
it adds murder charges connected to the deaths of @entity153 , a federal district judge , and @entity173 , a staff member for @entity8			2
@entity5 also faces charges in the deaths of @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , and a child , referred to in the indictment as @entity182 - year - old @entity181 was among those killed in the shooting			1
autopsy reports released monday showed that @entity173 , @entity177 and @entity144 suffered fatal head wounds , while the three others were shot in the chest			0
if convicted , @entity5 could face a death sentence , @entity9 attorney @entity189 said last week , although prosecutors have not said whether they will seek the death penalty			0
@entity2 's @entity193 reported from @entity0 and @entity194 contributed from @entity195 .			2
