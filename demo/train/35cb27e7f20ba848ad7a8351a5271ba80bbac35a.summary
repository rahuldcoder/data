@entity0 -- imagine if you could paint a working light switch directly onto your wall , without any need for sockets , cables or wiring			1
a group of students from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in @entity0 has made that possible by creating electrically conductive paint			1
the paint acts as a form of liquid wiring			1
unlike conventional wires , it can be applied to almost any surface , including paper , plastic , metal and even fabric			1
the product has the appearance and consistency of runny marmite , but dries quickly when exposed to the air			2
its inventors , @entity11 graduates @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , call their creation " @entity35			2
" while they do n't claim to be the first group to have invented a conductive ink , they are pioneering new ways it can be used			1
" we started this project in earnest in 2009 , " says @entity30			0
" we were originally interested in trying to apply electronics to the skin ... so we arrived at this idea of applying them as a coating and eventually we got this idea of a conductive paint			1
" the team began by investigating how electronics were being used in the body			0
" in 2008 -- and probably still today -- there was a lot of work around electronic textiles , " says @entity30			2
" and though we really liked the idea of having a jumper ( a piece of clothing ) that has some intelligence in it , we did n't like that it was so bulky and that once you took it off the functionality disappeared			0
" around the same time there was a lot of " extreme work " being done by people who were injecting electronics beneath the skin			0
for their final project , the @entity11 students began work on making something less intrusive , looking for a substance that could be painted onto the body			2
eventually , says @entity30 , " that idea transformed into the material we have now , which is very safe though it 's not specifically intended for the body anymore			0
" after graduating from college , the team collaborated on a video for @entity84 and producer @entity85			0
the resulting project was the " @entity93 , " a performance which literally brought the paint to life , with dancers whose movements triggered audio loops from @entity85 's song " @entity92			2
" " making a new material was a bit daunting for four designers , " says @entity30			0
the team 's solution was not to return to school to study chemistry for four years			0
instead , they simply went on @entity105			0
according to @entity30 , the online encyclopedia provided them with almost everything they needed to know about crafting conductive materials			2
once the paint 's formula was finalized , co-creator @entity29 says the team began to consider how it might be applied to real - world products			1
the first thing they launched was the paint in its raw form , which they made available to other garden - shed inventors			1
today , @entity35 jars and pens are sold on the @entity124 and stocked by @entity126 electronics stores across the @entity127			0
projects being done by @entity35 users include everything from interactive color wheels to homemade electric toys			1
@entity30 says that conductive paint opens up an enormous range of creative opportunities			1
as conductive paint becomes increasingly common , we can look forward to a future where billboards talk back , walls are interactive , and greeting cards come to life in our very hands			1
" devices no longer have to look high tech to be high tech , " @entity30 says			0
" our goal is to put interactivity onto objects you do n't expect			0

a group of students in @entity0 has developed electrically conductive paint
the paint allows wiring to be applied to paper , metal and even textiles
it is now being used in projects around the world including interactive posters and home - made toys
