-- @entity2 's top diplomat took a shot at the @entity5 and @entity6 attempts to bring democratic change to @entity8 on tuesday			1
foreign minister @entity9 singled out the @entity10 , a coalition of dozens of nations led by the @entity13 and the @entity14 calling for tough action against the @entity17 regime			2
" there are outside forces that are not interested in the success of the current @entity23 efforts , " @entity9 told reporters			0
" they are trying everything possible to substitute the @entity23 with various unofficial formats such as the ' @entity10 ' or some other forms			0
" and ( they are trying ) , with everything possible , to influence the @entity8 opposition so that it does n't work with the government in maintaining a cease - fire and setting up future dialogue			1
" @entity9 made the remarks as monitors tried to observe a @entity23 - backed cease - fire that was supposed to have been in effect since thursday			1
they are reviewing the government and opposition forces ' adherence to the cease - fire forged by @entity41 and @entity14 envoy @entity42			1
a halt in violence is part of @entity42 's six - point peace plan , which also calls for unimpeded humanitarian access and an " inclusive @entity8 - led political process			2
" " it is the @entity8 government 's responsibility to guarantee freedom of access and freedom of movement within the country for these observers			2
they should be allowed to freely move to any places where they will be able to observe the cessation of violence , " @entity23 @entity58 ban ki - moon said in @entity59 on tuesday			2
@entity42 's effort is supported by the @entity8 regime , @entity2 , @entity66 , the @entity13 , @entity67 and the @entity6 world			1
analysis : @entity23 diplomacy strengthens @entity71 despite a relative drop - off in reported deaths immediately after the thursday cease - fire deadline , violence persisted in @entity8 on tuesday , the 66th anniversary of the country 's independence from @entity79			1
at least 70 people were found dead across the country tuesday , the opposition @entity80 said			1
most of those slain were found in @entity86 province and other deaths occurred in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity17			0
some of those in @entity86 were killed during monday shelling , but their bodies were not discovered and identified until tuesday , the opposition group said			1
@entity94 , an activist in the volatile city of @entity88 , said the military is firing rockets and mortars at the @entity88 neighborhoods of @entity100 and @entity101			0
" today we have witnessed some of the worst attacks on @entity100 , " he said			0
" it is absolutely unbearable			0
" @entity106 , an opposition activist in the southern province of @entity89 , said the opposition @entity109 fighters have held their fire since the cease - fire began but the government has continued what he described as aggressive acts in @entity89 , as well as @entity88			1
he called the regime 's claim that it is reacting to the activities of armed gangs " a big lie " and believes the killing and shelling will persist			0
" i do n't think everything is going to be ok , " @entity106 said			0
the state - run @entity123 has consistently blamed " armed terrorist groups " for the violence and said aggression by the groups had " hysterically escalated " since the start of the cease - fire			1
but activist groups every day have cited killings by government security forces			0
" i think it 's clear that over the last several days , particularly since saturday , the violence has escalated , " @entity13 ambassador to the @entity23 @entity135 told @entity0 's chief international correspondent @entity136			1
@entity138 , @entity139 talk @entity8 with @entity136 @entity138 said the cease - fire is not holding			1
when asked whether that spells the end of the @entity42 mission , @entity138 said no , but that a shaky cease - fire certainly puts it in jeopardy			1
@entity138 stressed , as she has before , @entity13 opposition to military intervention in @entity8			1
" we 're rightly very apprehensive about increasing the militarization of this conflict			0
it 's already a hot war			0
it could spill over , " she said			0
@entity8 has been engulfed in violence for 13 months as a national uprising spread after the government began cracking down on peaceful protests			2
the @entity41 estimates at least 9,000 people have died since the protests began , while others put the death toll at more than 11,000			0
analysis : @entity23 observer mission wo n't change endgame @entity0 can not independently verify reports of violence and deaths , as the government has severely restricted access by international media			0
the @entity13 and the @entity41 have slammed the crackdown , and there have been international calls for @entity8 president @entity175 to leave office			1
@entity2 , long a staunch ally of @entity8 , and @entity66 have thwarted tough @entity23 action against @entity17 , including calls for the president to step down			0
after those countries vetoed a @entity23 resolution in february , the @entity13 , @entity6 nations , @entity67 and other groups formed @entity10 , an initiative to bring democratic change to the nation			0
the group backs the efforts of the @entity189 -- an opposition movement with strong backing among @entity8 activists and citizens -- and other opposition groups to pursue a democratic system			1
representatives from one opposition group , the @entity197 , visited @entity2 on tuesday			1
the group 's leader , @entity199 , said the @entity42 plan is the " last chance " for peace in @entity8 , @entity2 media reported			2
he is quoted as saying that the " @entity8 dialogue needs " help from international groups such as the @entity41 and the @entity14			0
@entity207 , a @entity8 expert at the @entity208 , describes the coordination committee , based in @entity8 , as an " older opposition " that does n't have the mass grass - roots and youth support of the @entity189			2
however , he said , " this is the established opposition the regime would rather dialogue with			0
" @entity42 was in @entity217 on tuesday to participate in an @entity14 meeting on @entity8 , according to the state - run news agency in @entity217			2
@entity8 foreign minister @entity224 " will pay a working visit to @entity66 " on wednesday at the invitation of @entity66 foreign minister @entity226 , @entity66 's state - run @entity222 news agency said			2
a group focused on imposing sanctions against the @entity8 regime convened in @entity230 on tuesday , a meeting co-chaired by @entity79 , @entity232 and a @entity234 unit			1
the @entity235 on @entity236 reiterated moves made in @entity238 by the @entity10 to implement various " restrictive measures			0
" it strongly disapproved " of any financial and other support to the @entity8 regime and in particular ongoing arms sales			2
" the group also welcomed " sanctions adopted by the @entity234 , the @entity14 , the @entity13 , @entity67 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 " against @entity8 and urged those in the @entity10 and " states that have not yet exerted the necessary pressure to join these efforts and further isolate the @entity8 regime			1
