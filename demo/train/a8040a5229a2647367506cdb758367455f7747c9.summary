-- he was @entity2 's ultimate matador and golf 's greatest escape artist			1
there was seemingly no situation @entity7 could n't extricate himself from , whether his golf ball was rooted behind a tree , in a stream , buried in a hedge or deep in the car park			1
and the @entity13 did it all with such infectious brio that his career in the sport genuinely redefined it			1
now , 25 years after @entity7 secured the first of his five major titles at the @entity21 , and three years after his death , a film entitled " @entity7 " charts the career of golf 's most charismatic star			1
taking its cue from a similar sporting opus " @entity34 , " about the life of @entity33 's @entity32 star , it is produced by @entity35 , whose credits include " @entity37 " while a large portion of the film is made up of stirring archive footage , a thread of dramatized reconstructions chart the story of @entity7 ' formative years as a teenager			1
from a poor farming family , @entity7 taught himself the game by hitting pebbles on the beach in his home town of @entity49 after tying the discarded head of a three iron onto a stick			1
" i think he was certainly the most charismatic of his or any other generation , certainly the first one to stir the young ladies hearts when they were watching , " @entity35 told @entity0			0
" but unless you understand @entity7 ' background , you wo n't understand @entity7			1
" @entity7 had this poor background , he had a good time with his loving parents and was the spoiled little boy in the family , but while there was always food on the table there was no money			1
" he was up against it and you can see that in his personality as he developed			0
he had this aspect that everyone loved because he had charisma , style , intelligence			0
" and because of learning the game in this famous way -- playing the game for two years with one club -- he 'd got to know how to improvise			0
" i think everyone would agree he 's one of the game 's greatest ever improvisers			0
" @entity7 was the son of a shepherd determined to gatecrash the exclusive world of golf , and his rags to riches story was ripe for adaption on the big screen			1
often he would scale the walls of the exclusive @entity91 near his home just to hit a few shots in the fading light of day , or under a full moon			0
it was this round - the - clock dedication to golf that indirectly led to his expulsion from school , when snoozing in class as a 12 - year - old resulted in a confrontation with one of his teachers			0
by the time @entity7 hit 13 whispers of his potential prompted a winner - takes - all contest against the region 's under - 25 champion with a purse of 50,000 pesetas at stake			1
that contest provides one of the centerpieces of the film , but having decided on a cinematic strand to recreate @entity7 ' childhood , @entity35 now needed someone who could play a young @entity7			1
enter @entity120 , who not only bears an uncanny resemblance to @entity7 at that age , but is also a very accomplished golfer from @entity124 , on @entity2 's northern coast			1
the 16 - year - old had , by his own admission , only filled the role of an extra in school plays previously , but was persuaded to audition by the secretary of his golf club due to his resemblance to @entity7			1
" i said to her ' are you kidding ? ' how am i going to be @entity7 because i have never been an actor , ' @entity120 explained to @entity0			2
" i went to just have fun , after a month i had a golf tournament and i received a phone call that said ' we want you to play the role of @entity7			2
' i remember i started screaming			0
" but was the prospect of playing one of @entity2 's favorite sporting sons daunting ? " i thought it was going to be difficult in the way he was such a unique player who showed such great effort , hard work and will power , " @entity120 said			1
" but also , it was easy in the way that he has always been my idol , the master that i always tried to be like			0
" learning all facets of the game with such a primitive tool afforded @entity7 seemingly miraculous powers of recovery			2
he 'd often hit few fairways during his round but still come in under par. perhaps his most famous escape was en route to his first major win in 1979 , at the @entity21 in @entity162 , after which he became dubbed the " car park champion			2
" smashing his drive into a car park off the 16th fairway , a clutch of vehicles had to be moved before @entity7 took a drop , chipped onto the green and made a birdie , going on to win the @entity173 by three shots			2
it was the signpost for a career that would be rife with invention and magnetism , as well as the odd ill tempered rant , that injected new vigor into a hitherto conservative sport			0
@entity7 became the first @entity182 to win the masters in 1980 , adding another green jacket in 1983 , and won @entity21 twice more after @entity162 , in 1984 and 1988			1
add over 90 career titles into the mix , eight @entity186 appearances for @entity182 as a player and one as captain , and @entity7 's mantel as a founding father of the modern day @entity193 was secured			1
and all of those riches can be traced back to thousands of hours of practice on the beach in @entity49 with a makeshift club			0
" i think this is probably the key of his magic because if he could do everything with just a 3 iron i ca n't imagine how good he could have done with all the clubs , " @entity120 added			0
" i had to practice because it is not the same playing with the irons of today -- they are really small			0
with a driver especially the difference is really big			0
" after retiring in 2007 @entity7 suffered a brain tumor in 2008 and finally succumbed to cancer in 2011 aged 54			2
" it 's relatively recent that @entity7 died but i think this is the right time for the film -- we still have perspective on him , " @entity35 explained			1
" @entity7 does seem to cross over , this is the big thing			2
whether i 'm proven right or wrong we 'll see in the next few months but people who do n't play golf have heard of @entity7			2
" and in this age of better access to facilities and media trained stars , does @entity35 ever think golf will see his like again ? " i do n't think we 're going to have another @entity7 -- he is a one off , " he said			0
" none of today 's golfers seem to come from poverty -- everyone can join a golf club			0
no - one is going to have this walking nightmare to get going			0
" dear old @entity238 ( @entity239 ) had a psychiatrist when he was four or five ; @entity7 developed his wit by his own wit if you like			0
