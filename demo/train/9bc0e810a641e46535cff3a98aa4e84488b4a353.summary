@entity0 -- chief justice @entity2 is warning leaders in the other two branches of the federal government that the pending " fiscal cliff " would " inevitably result in the delay or denial of justice for the people the courts serve			1
" in his annual year - end report on the federal judiciary , @entity2 on monday said the federal courts have already made significant cuts in their funding , representing only about two - tenths of 1 % of the entire federal budget			1
he said a prolonged reduction would be extremely hard to overcome			1
" i therefore encourage the president and @entity22 to be especially attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and provide the resources necessary for its operations , " said the chief justice			1
" those vital resource needs include the appointment of an adequate number of judges to keep current on pending cases			2
at the close of 2012 , 27 of the existing judicial vacancies are designated as presenting judicial emergencies			1
" @entity2 made his remarks in a 16 - page summary of @entity39 courts , part of his role as head of the entire federal judiciary			1
president @entity44 said monday an agreement to avert the " fiscal cliff " of automatic tax increases and spending cuts appeared to be " within sight			0
" @entity51 and @entity52 leaders were continuing to meet behind closed doors with @entity52 officials , including vice president @entity55 , to reach at least a temporary tax and spending agreement			0
@entity2 noted the judicial branch generally receives less attention when it comes to its spending , but an " aggressive " cost - containment strategy has been in place since 2004			1
" our country faces new challenges , including the much publicized ' fiscal cliff ' and the longer - term problem of a truly extravagant and burgeoning national debt , " @entity2 said			2
" no one seriously doubts that the country 's fiscal ledger has gone awry			0
the public properly looks to its elected officials to craft a solution			0
we in the judiciary stand outside the political arena , but we can continue to do our part to address the financial challenges within our sphere			0
" the federal court system and its administrative offices operate on an annual budget of nearly $ 7 billion			2
that includes judges trying and hearing cases and appeals , both criminal and civil ; managing pretrial , defender , and probation offices ; and maintaining the bankruptcy court system			0
most of the money -- about 62 % -- goes for personnel costs			0
social media users vent over fiscal cliff @entity2 said the @entity100 itself requested a 2.8 % decrease in its $ 75.55 million operations budget in fiscal year 2012			2
he added a 3.7 % decrease is expected for fiscal year 2014			0
there currently are 75 judicial vacancies , according to the @entity107			1
thirty - two nominations by the president are pending , awaiting @entity51 confirmation			0
there are 874 federal judges , including the nine - member @entity100 , the district and appeals courts , and the nine - member @entity116			2
past year - end reports from the current chief justice have focused on budget cutbacks , frozen salaries , rising caseloads , and court security			1
these summaries have been an annual tradition for about four decades			0
they were begun by the late chief justice @entity127 as a way to speak to the executive branch and @entity22 , the judiciary itself , and the public at large .			1

a prolonged reduction in funding would be hard to overcome , chief justice @entity2 says
he notes 27 federal judicial vacancies are ' designated as presenting judicial emergencies '
' aggressive ' cost containment has been in place for federal courts since 2004 , he says
