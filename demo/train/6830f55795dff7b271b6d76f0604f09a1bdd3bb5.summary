-- @entity1 failed to clinch the year - end no. 1 ranking for the third time in his career after suffering a shock defeat at the @entity6 on saturday			1
the form player of the men 's tennis season after coming back from long - term knee problems , @entity1 could have added to his 2008 and 2010 feats by beating @entity12 and reaching the final of the penultimate tournament on the calendar			1
however , he lost 6 - 3 7 - 5 to his third - ranked compatriot , who will defend his title in sunday 's final against @entity18			1
the @entity19 earlier kept alive his hopes of being year - end no. 1 for the third successive year by beating 17 - time grand slam champion @entity22 in saturday 's opening semifinal			1
" i played maybe my best match this season , " @entity12 said after ending a nine - match losing run to @entity1			2
" @entity27 is very special for me			2
i made my first final of a grand slam in @entity30 ; last year i won my first masters 1000 title ; now i 'm in the final again in @entity27			2
" second - ranked @entity18 had to come from behind to win 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 against the veteran @entity33 , who is showing signs of improved form			2
both matches were dress rehearsals for the @entity39 in @entity40 next week , where @entity1 and @entity12 will be in @entity41 along with @entity42 and debutant @entity43			2
defending champion @entity18 and six - time winner @entity22 will be in @entity44 with @entity45 and @entity46			1
" i was pretty happy with my level of play , " said @entity22 , who will equal @entity48 's record 12 consecutive appearances at the season - ending event			1
" i wish i could have kept it up for a bit longer and put him under pressure , but @entity18 battled well to stay in the match in the second set and the third set			0
" i had my chances in the second and third sets			0
disappointed right now , but overall it was a good week for me			0
" on friday , @entity22 avenged his @entity62 final defeat by @entity45 -- and the @entity63 's week got even worse when he was robbed at @entity27 ' @entity65 train station en route to @entity67			1
his confidence will be shaken after losing his most prized possession -- a rosary that was blessed by the @entity71 in @entity72 this year , which was in a briefcase stolen as he checked in			0
" my rosary blessed by @entity78 , i carried it everywhere , " the 25 - year - old told the @entity76 website			0
" that 's what matters most to me			0
i was finishing the check - in and was asked for an autograph			0
i turned around to sign it and , within 20 seconds , it was stolen			0
" meanwhile , the @entity87 women 's team took a big step towards a fourth @entity90 title after winning both singles matches on the opening day of the final against an under - strength @entity94 saturday			1
@entity87 , whose last title came in 2010 , saw its top - ranked player @entity98 thrash @entity99 6 - 1 6 - 4 after @entity100 battled to a 5 - 7 7 - 5 8 - 6 win against @entity102			2
both @entity94 were making their debut in the largest team tournament in women 's international sport , which featured 97 nations this year , as the country 's top 11 players were unavailable			1
the final clashes with the @entity111 's @entity110 in @entity112 , a second - tier end - of - season event where @entity94 's @entity113 lost to @entity114 in saturday 's semis and @entity117 's @entity116 beat @entity19 @entity118			1
the @entity119 , which plans to move the @entity90 final back a week next season , announced saturday that @entity121 will be banned from the men 's @entity123 tournament after refusing to allow one of its players to compete against an @entity128			1
@entity129 had been due to play @entity130 at last month 's @entity131			0
" there is no room for prejudice of any kind in sport or in society , " @entity119 president @entity132 said			0
" the @entity119 board decided to send a strong message to the @entity141 that this kind of action will not be tolerated by any of our members			0
" the board felt that suspension from @entity123 , a competition that was founded 113 years ago to encourage better understanding through sport , would provide a good lesson for the federation and a fitting penalty for their unfortunate action			0

world no. 2 @entity18 will play @entity12 in sunday 's @entity6 final
@entity18 comes from behind to beat @entity22 in saturday 's opening semifinal
@entity39 @entity160 is robbed of prized rosary in @entity27
