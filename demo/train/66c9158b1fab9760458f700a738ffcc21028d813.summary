with @entity3 majorities coming in both houses of @entity5 and a @entity6 in the @entity7 , many people in @entity1 believe nothing will get done			2
we 'd like to nominate an exception to that expectation : criminal justice reform			1
@entity13 has talked about the need for " confidence - building measures " between the president and @entity3 in @entity5			0
the idea is that we should work on easier things first , so that we can work on harder things next			2
transforming our nation 's failed prison system looks like it could be easier now than anyone expected			1
leaders in both parties agree on the need and direction for reform			1
they recognize that locking up millions of people for very long periods of time at ballooning costs is not a wise response to nonviolent crime			1
warehousing nonviolent offenders for years behind bars has been an economic , moral and human catastrophe			0
the @entity38 has 5 % of the world 's population , but 25 % of its incarcerated population			1
during the past four decades , the rate of incarceration in the @entity38 has more than quadrupled , costing us more than $ 80 billion a year			1
there are now roughly 2.3 million people in prison or in jail , which is nearly one in every 100 @entity38			1
today in a @entity53 prison , a 19 - year - old man is serving a 15 - year mandatory minimum sentence for drug possession			0
his incarceration will cost taxpayers $ 60,000 a year			0
he will receive no job training , no education and no drug treatment			0
he will leave prison beaten down			0
he 'll carry the stigma and the barriers that come with being a felon , making it difficult for him to find a job and more likely that he will end up back in prison			0
as a corrections system , this makes no sense			0
we must rethink our approach from the ground up			0
and for federal crimes , we can start by building on bipartisan reforms that are spreading across the country at the state level			2
in the true spirit of federalism , states have led the way in passing reforms that protect public safety , more effectively punish and correct nonviolent offenders , save taxpayers money and ensure hardened and violent criminals remain behind bars			1
in @entity89 , gov. @entity88 has implemented a bold overhaul of the state 's criminal justice system , slashing prison spending and reducing harsh penalties for nonviolent offenses			1
the result has been a 20 % reduction over five years in the number of @entity100 men incarcerated			0
in @entity102 , gov. @entity101 has been so successful at using probation , parole and sentencing reform to both reduce the prison population while also reducing crime that people have termed his approach the " @entity110			1
" out west , @entity111 recently passed one of the most transformational examples of bipartisan criminal justice reform			1
@entity115 47 , the " @entity116 and @entity117 , " was a sensible measure to reduce incarceration for nonviolent crimes and to increase investments in crime prevention , treatment and education			2
the initiative changed six low - level offenses , including simple drug possession , from felonies to misdemeanors , and will save @entity111 hundreds of millions of dollars each year in prison spending that was n't working , reinvesting those savings into mental health and drug treatment , k - 12 schools and victim services			2
while there is a lot to learn from the policy reforms brought about by @entity139 , there may be even more to learn from its politics			2
the initiative had the support of crime survivors , victims groups , business groups and 1,500 clergy across the state			0
everyone from rapper @entity149 and the @entity150 to sen. @entity151 and @entity152 lined up behind the measure			0
( we both endorsed it , too			0
) conservative @entity111 businessman @entity156 was the single largest individual donor to the effort , giving more than $ 1.25 million			0
because of its broad - based support , @entity115 47 passed by a huge margin of 59 - 41 percent			2
it even won in some conservative strongholds , such as @entity163 and @entity164			0
@entity111 is n't the only place where criminal justice reform did well on the ballot			1
deal , and senators such as @entity169 and @entity170 were re-elected by big margins , campaigning in part on their criminal justice reform efforts			1
and in @entity175 , voters passed a state constitutional amendment reforming the bail system that was championed by both @entity178 gov. @entity178 and the @entity179			2
if criminal justice reform can happen in places as diverse as @entity89 , @entity102 , @entity111 and @entity175 , then it should be possible to bring similar reforms to the federal level in @entity1 there are a number of good bipartisan bills in the @entity188 that should be our starting point			1
one of the most important is the " @entity190 , " authored by conservative sen. @entity191 and liberal sen. @entity192			0
it would reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenses			2
senators @entity151 and @entity170 have also introduced important , bipartisan legislation			0
even more than the current debate in the @entity188 , however , the approaching 2016 election season offers the opportunity for the @entity100 people to make criminal justice reform a priority			1
voters should demand of each presidential and gubernatorial candidate a vision for reducing incarceration and cutting prison spending while improving public safety and helping nonviolent offenders live full , productive lives within the law			0
in the interest of ensuring criminal justice reform is part of the conversation about who should be our next president , we will convene a national summit on criminal justice reform on march 26 , 2015 , under the banner of # cut50 -- a new bipartisan initiative of @entity221 , which @entity222 leads , to help cut the prison population in half over the next 10 years			1
our overreliance on prisons has failed @entity38			1
it is past time for both political parties to come together and fix a bad system of their own making			2
we believe this moment offers a once - in - a generation opportunity for reforms that will save entire communities and transform the lives of millions of @entity38			1
we must not let it pass .			0

new @entity239 , @entity240 : criminal justice reform is easier now than people expect
@entity239 , @entity240 : leaders in both parties agree on the need and direction of reform
they say already states have passed reforms that reduce penalties and slash spending
writers : our overreliance on prisons has failed @entity38 , it 's time for change
