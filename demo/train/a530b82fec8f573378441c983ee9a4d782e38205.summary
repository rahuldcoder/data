yachts fill the bay in front of sparkling new skyscrapers rising from the city beyond			1
cross the street to the other side , and sandy beaches are lined with restaurants and nightclubs			2
sunbathers lounge during the day , replaced in the evening by fine diners who think nothing of plopping down a couple hundred dollars for sushi or lobster			1
after a pre-disco nap , the beautiful people emerge and the music cranks up from midnight until the sun comes up again			0
it 's not @entity21 or @entity22 , but the @entity23 , a tropical beach playground in the @entity26 country of @entity27 for the wealthy and increasing number of expatriates who work there			1
sound like a party worth checking out ? there 's a catch			2
visas to @entity27 are notoriously difficult to get and those that do get the stamp must ready themselves to swallow some whopping prices			0
@entity23 is among the top 10 most expensive cities in the world for expats -- behind @entity42 and @entity43 , and well above other famously expensive cities : @entity45 is 5th , @entity48 11th , @entity47 29th , @entity46 39th			1
unlike those cities , @entity23 's wealthy waterfront is surrounded by grinding poverty , visible to anyone landing at the airport			1
that 's an image that the city is trying to change , transforming its marginal bay - front walkway and the @entity57 , the thin peninsula that stretches in front of the city			1
for those that do make it here -- and it 's worth trying , there 's nowhere else like it -- here are the places to go			2
@entity69 housed in a two - story house next to the @entity72 , @entity69 restaurant is located on the way to the @entity57			1
the soldier at the entrance will let guests through to the white - walled patio if they explain they 're coming for dinner			1
even though seafood seems like the smart choice here , the steak with pepper sauce is better			2
honestly , there 's better food elsewhere , but it 's a unique location with an unmatched view of the city on the way out			1
@entity69 , @entity89 ; +244 926 322 615 @entity90 @entity90 is one of the most expensive places to eat in the city , which in @entity23 is saying something			1
why so pricey ? because even though guests are gazing over the @entity97 , and @entity27 has some of the world 's least - fished waters , the seafood here is flown in from @entity100			1
a decent meal for two costs $ 300 , but the @entity104 lobster can cost nearly that much per kilo			0
still , many people swear by the place			0
those people all have expense accounts			0
after dinner , @entity108 turns into a high - powered nightclub with dancing until sunrise			2
@entity90 , no. 15 @entity112 ; +244 936 000 018 coconuts few places embody the changes on the @entity57 as much as @entity113			0
fifteen years ago , this was a shell of a building , without a roof , windows or doors			0
a series of renovations have turned it into a luxurious spot that takes full advantage of its place at the end of the peninsula			0
@entity113 is now a great spot to enjoy a daytime drink or linger over an evening of seafood with friends			2
the chef prepares a special menu every week			0
it 's not as expensive as some restaurants , but budget a minimum of $ 100 a person			1
@entity113 , @entity139 , @entity57 do @entity140 ; +244 912 205 777 @entity141 in many ways , @entity141 represents @entity23 's cosmopolitan aspirations			1
with one of the best views over the city , the international menu runs from pizza to sushi			2
it 's a relative bargain : the pizza sets diners back just $ 25			1
if at this point they 're feeling really pinched for cash , they can always have a drink and then wander to the wimpy burger joint next door			0
@entity159 , @entity139 , @entity160 do @entity161 ; +244 222 309 430 @entity162 those who 'd rather walk along @entity23 's newly renovated @entity164 could n't ask for a better spot than @entity162			1
the restaurant long predates the $ 350 million upgrade to the bayside boardwalk , which was once just another dusty , smelly street in a city where dusty and smelly are par for the course			1
now it 's got wide pedestrian trails , playgrounds and palm trees imported from @entity21			2
yes , palm trees imported to tropical @entity27			0
nonetheless , @entity162 is a romantic spot to share a langoustine pizza by candlelight			0
and eating here wo n't break the bank			0
@entity162 , 183/184 @entity183 ; +244 222 370 610 @entity184 for those who can find the place , the best thing to do on the @entity57 is to hang with @entity23 's @entity189 community at @entity191 's house			1
that 's not the name of the venue			2
it 's a house owned by a guy named @entity191			0
friday nights and sunday afternoons , music lovers gather on his terrace to hear him perform @entity203 classics and songs from @entity189 legend , the @entity206 , @entity205			0
friday nights and sunday afternoons			0
drive down the @entity57 , exit the roundabout to the left			0
it 's the only house with lights on the street .			0

@entity23 's beach front is filled with restaurants where diners think nothing of dropping a few hundred dollars on seafood
@entity219 is a white - walled patio restaurant with an unmatched view of the city
@entity224 imports its *super-expensive* seafood from @entity100 , despite *proximity* of @entity97
