-- it 's a phrase uniquely hated by high school teachers and internship coordinators everywhere : " could you write me a reference ? " but it means something different now than it did even a decade ago			1
sure , trigonometry teachers still need to crank out those form letters packed with hoary cliches like , " a pleasure to have in class , " and " interested in education in the truest sense of the word " and " correctly follows @entity18 guidelines at least 80 % of the time when turning in papers			2
" but now the rest of us are treating our networks like the people version of @entity25 , giving ( and soliciting ) reviews all over the place			0
@entity27 has long had a " ask to be endorsed " function ( that 's seriously what it says ) , where coworkers and bosses can gush about you right on your online resume			1
but the site 's no longer the only space where you 're begging for accolades			1
the person borrowing or lending you a car ( see @entity39 ) , a bike ( see @entity41 ) , an apartment ( see @entity43 ) or even an electric drill ( see @entity45 ) wants to know that you are not , in fact , a psychopath			1
so in a weird way , your presence on these online bazaars , where social media meets the marketplace , has become part of your online persona			1
and would n't it suck if a potential employer googled you and learned that you misrepresented the " spacious " parking lot in front of your lawn ( see @entity60 ) , which is actually ... your lawn ? @entity63 , we offer up some tips for giving ( and getting ) digital referrals that will show the world just what a wonderful human you are			1
do n't just use the site 's " request a referral " function			1
it 's jarring to be going through your day and then suddenly get an email that basically says , " a person in your life wants you to sign up for a site you 've never heard of and write nice things about him / her			1
" reach out to your target reference first , and ask if she 'd mind doing you the favor			1
and do n't feel too bad about the ask			0
research shows that people enjoy the ego boost of doing something altruistic , so in a way , you 're doing her a favor			0
not entirely , but give her some bullet points			0
see , stringing together words is kind of hard for a lot of people			0
( see : online comments sections			1
zing ! ) and if your friend or former boss is n't entirely sure which of your virtuous qualities you want highlighted , she runs the risk of writing something off - topic and wasting both of your time			1
outline what you 're looking for her to say ( e.g. , " it 'd be awesome if you could just mention that i 'm responsible and respectful and take good care of my stuff			0
" assuming that is not a blatant lie			0
) also give her a basic sense of how long it should be -- a sentence , a paragraph , a whole freaking recommendation letter ? 3			1
volunteer to return the favor			0
ask if she 'd like a recommendation on the same site or another one			1
everyone could use a boost			0
put some stock into strangers ' reviews ... zero reviews on a site that hinges on trust should give you pause			1
( one @entity43 user had her apartment " burglarized and ransacked " by a guest , prompting the company to add an insurance policy			2
) if you 're going to lend someone your car or apartment ( not just a jigsaw ) , try to @entity146 him , get him on the phone and / or friend him ( temporarily ) on @entity149			2
but not too much stock			0
it is n't hard to create a fake profile and make nice , allegedly third - person comments about yourself			2
so , depending on your personal level of paranoia , the above steps of added due diligence might be wise even for established users			0
be a good little reviewer bee			0
whenever you deal directly with a person online ( buying a used book on @entity165 , etc. ) , take the 20 seconds afterward to rate the experience			2
if it was good , you 're growing their business , and if it was bad , you 're doing a good deed for the rest of humanity			0
we know , we know , you 're too busy to rate experiences after - the - fact			2
that 's why you 're doing dealings online in the wee hours of the night while eating @entity180 and wiping the crumbs on your shirt , right ? well , giving and getting reviews is a ( sad , half , proxy for ) actual human interaction			2
take whatever you can get .			0

presence in " online bazaars " such as car - lender @entity39 is part of a digital persona
reach out to your target before sending an online recommendation request
be careful when a site user has zero recommendations
write recommendations for businesses and others yourself
