-- defending champions @entity1 marched five points clear at the top of the @entity4 on saturday with a 2 - 0 victory that left @entity6 in the relegation zone			1
@entity9 's team bounced back from last weekend 's goalless draw at @entity11 to put the onus on title rivals @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity15 travel to @entity14 on sunday , while @entity16 face a potentially tricky clash with @entity19 in the club 's first match since @entity23 striker @entity22 -- who is sidelined with injury -- made a surprise turnaround and decided to sign a new five - year contract after threatening to leave			1
@entity1 faced a @entity28 team who had not won since the opening day of the season , but made hard work of the victory after taking the lead in the 23rd minute			2
@entity35 helped @entity36 -- his fellow goalscorer in the midweek @entity38 win over @entity39 -- set up @entity41 winger @entity40 for the opener			0
the visitors belied their lowly league position and squandered several chances to equalize , coming closest when halftime substitute @entity47 's header was cleared off the line by @entity49			0

@entity67 looked to have greater energy as the game progressed though @entity102 , who had managed well as @entity67 's only forward , was replaced with @entity41 striker @entity104 after sustaining an injury			2
the move prompted @entity64 manager @entity107 to shuffle his pack and introduce the presence of striker @entity110 in place of speedy winger @entity112 , as both sides gambled for the win			2

@entity147 moved up to seventh place after beating @entity11 1 - 0 to end a run of five successive draws , as @entity152 's first - half own - goal proved the difference between the teams			1
the @entity156 defender could only divert @entity159 midfielder @entity158 's 25th - minute cross into his own net , and @entity11 earlier saw winger @entity161 hit the post and striker @entity163 completely miskicked in front of goal in the second half			0
@entity147 have scored just 11 times in nine league matches -- seven from @entity23 striker @entity169 , two from record signing @entity170 , and two own - goals			0
@entity173 joined @entity147 on 12 points with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity176 , who moved above @entity119 into 14th place			1
@entity176 took the lead just before the hour mark through @entity182 striker @entity181 , but @entity184 forward @entity183 leveled in the 66th minute			0
