@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 , already under investigation for lavish spending , allowed an employee to telecommute from @entity7 even though he is based at the @entity5 's @entity0 , @entity1 , office , a @entity2 investigation has found			1
it cost more than $ 24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland @entity12 over the past year			1
he is among several hundred @entity5 " virtual " workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices , costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years			1
under the program , employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they 're actually assigned			0
the @entity0 employee , who started his job in january 2011 , is paid $ 84,440 and works from his home in @entity27 , a @entity5 representative confirmed			1
in the past year , according to @entity5 travel records , the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings			1
four of those trips were to @entity35 ; four were to @entity36 , with a side trip to @entity38 ; and one was to @entity40			0
the total cost to taxpayers was $ 24,221			0
@entity43 , the @entity5 's regional administrator for @entity0 , defended the hire			1
" the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants , " @entity43 said			2
" and when factoring all of those in , it was determined that he was the best candidate , even in light of the cost that would be incurred			0
" @entity43 called the @entity5 's teleworking program " a successful program that 's going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers			1
" but a @entity5 spokeswoman said , " we are not going to defend this type of travel			2
" and a @entity5 employee in @entity0 , who requested anonymity , said that hiring someone in @entity7 to work for the @entity0 region was ludicrous			2
" it does n't make sense , " the employee said			0
" when you consider everything you need when you hire someone , it would have been better to look for someone in the @entity0 area			0
it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from @entity27 to @entity36 , where a lot of business is done			0
" @entity85 , who was appointed acting @entity5 administrator this year , said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program			1
" i think the most important part for the @entity5 to think about is make sure we open ourselves up , avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country , but then also make sure we have a clear business case , " he said			0
" if we have someone who is working in @entity97 but reporting to @entity98 , there has to be a clear explanation for what value they 're providing , and you 've got to give me the business case			0
you 've got to explain to me why that 's a cost - effective move for the @entity12 people , and that 's a new standard that we 're asking everyone at @entity5 to adhere to			1
" the @entity5 " virtual employee " program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including @entity2 's parent company , @entity112 , in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week , partially to reduce traffic congestion			1
the @entity116 requested details about the @entity5 's teleworking program in june			2
that followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees , including 12 in supervisory positions , spent nearly $ 750,000 in travel costs between october 2010 and june 2011			2
" the @entity12 people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program , " according to a letter from committee chairman rep. @entity131 , @entity132 , to the @entity5			1
the details requested by @entity131 about the @entity5 program have not been provided to the committee			2
@entity2 also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal @entity137 but has been repeatedly told by the @entity5 that @entity137 staff members have not finished compiling the material			0
the @entity5 , which has more than 12,600 employees and a $ 26.3 billion budget , is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non-military procurement			2
@entity144 launched an investigation into the @entity5 after a scathing inspector general 's report issued this year showed lavish spending -- $ 823,000 -- at the agency 's @entity149 in @entity151 in october 2010			1
the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released			0
the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation , embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the @entity5			0
@entity161 , the @entity5 official who organized the conference , resigned , as did the agency 's administrator , @entity163			1
two of @entity163 's deputies were fired , and eight other employees left the agency			0
@entity85 , a former @entity169 official , took over as acting @entity5 administrator			0
in addition to the @entity151 conference , the @entity5 apparently spent $ 330,000 to relocate an employee from @entity174 to @entity7 and probably millions more on other employees over a two - year period , according to a transcript of an interview with a @entity5 event planner			2
and 84 @entity5 employees , most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses , totaling more than $ 1 million in taxpayer money			0
in july , a @entity2 investigation revealed that the @entity5 's @entity0 office spent more than $ 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit			1
while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion - dollar government budgets , insiders said it was part of the free - spending culture that went on for years at the @entity5 's @entity0 regional headquarters			1
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity201 said in a statement this year that all the agency 's practices are under a top - down review			1
@entity2 's @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report			0
