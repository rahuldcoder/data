imagine that you lived in a country that every day had to stay vigilante because of the risk of terrorist attacks -- physical or of the cyber variety			2
or that has faced blizzards of historic proportions , with another winter storm on the way			0
and imagine if the people you were depending on to help you were expected to turn up for work , but that they may or may not be getting paid			0
well , thanks to a completely avoidable standoff in @entity16 , you might not have to imagine at all			1
february 28 marks the date when money for the @entity19 runs out as @entity21 @entity20 hold the @entity19 's funding hostage to make an ideological point			1
they say they are unhappy with president @entity27 's executive orders rescinding deportation for a class of undocumented immigrants known as the @entity31 , among others			0
as a result , unless a deal is reached , more than 200,000 employees will be required to show up to work next monday without pay			1
if we lived in a world that existed solely on the ideological plane , then @entity21 speaker @entity38 's approach might be brilliant -- the work of the agency created to enforce our borders and immigration rules would grind to a halt , the president would capitulate , and @entity38 would have achieved some sort of short - lived " victory " on the backs of immigrants , many of whom arrived here as babies			0
but most of us live in the real world , where actions have consequences for the rest of us			1
and that means not just those disappointed immigrants who believed they were beginning the process of securing citizenship			0
it also includes those who work at @entity19 and the people that depend on them			1
maybe the public is n't outraged by this fight because they associate @entity19 with long lines at airports and the checks undertaken by the @entity71			1
but hundreds of thousands of " essential " workers at @entity71 and the many other sections of @entity19 that work to keep us safe are facing the reality that they will not get a regular paycheck			1
yes , they will get their money eventually , but if this standoff continues , there will be no certainty when -- it could be weeks			2
and how many @entity82 supporting families can work indefinitely not knowing when the next paycheck is coming ? this is n't to say that the creation and execution of @entity19 's work has been seamless			1
created back in 2003 through the merging of a few dozen agencies ( and the addition of a couple more ) , @entity19 has struggled with its identity , morale ( it regularly ranks as least favorite federal agency to work at ) , and role			1
and the department is by no means perfect -- i served as assistant secretary early in the @entity27 administration , so i am fully aware of the challenges			0
but one of @entity19 's fundamental roles has always been to work with states and localities in crises management , disaster relief funding , and emergency response training			1
and it is in these specific roles -- supporting state emergency management agencies , writing checks to localities and individuals who have suffered harm , and training hundreds of thousands of first - responders on how to protect their communities -- that the @entity19 standoff will surely be felt			1
without funding , local budgeting processes and support for first responders can not be accounted for			2
without funding , homeowners and those harmed in disasters will not receive monetary relief			2
without funding , the training and exercises that are funded by the federal government to support local and state planning in a real crisis will not materialize			2
right now , where i live , in the @entity140 area , we have suffered four blizzards of historical proportions that have brought the city to a standstill			0
our metropolitan transit system has been closed periodically , roads can not be plowed fast enough , our harbor 's commercial activity is slowed due to ice buildup , and there is simply no place to put all this snow			0
local businesses have been harmed , damage has accrued , and the citizenry is demoralized			0
but the situation will be worse for residents in hard - hit places like @entity140 if @entity19 and one of its agencies , the @entity161 , is not able to help buttress local and state efforts at recovering from the barrage of storms the region has faced			1
of course our disaster - relief system is not perfect			0
but the system we have now is the one that individuals , cities and states have come to rely on			0
and it does provide funds for localities to train and exercise their responses so that fewer people will be at risk			0
these are the stakes in the real world			0
yet even though a @entity184 court may have handed @entity38 a face - saving lifeline by ruling @entity27 's actions unlawful and essentially stopping the presidential actions pending appeal , @entity21 @entity20 appear undeterred , although senate majority leader @entity189 on tuesday indicated @entity190 @entity20 might be willing to offer some concessions			2
as a result of this deadlock , you can increasingly expect to hear governors and mayors -- who actually run something -- to begin to push @entity21 @entity20 to sign a clean funding bill that will keep @entity19 funded			1
after all , these leaders know as well as anyone that ideology can only go so far when the well - being and safety of our homeland is at stake .			0

@entity19 will run out of money without funding deal
