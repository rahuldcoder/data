-- he was once hailed as the next @entity2			0
but , more than a decade later , @entity3 has called time on his tennis career after failing to build on the promise that took him to the heights of fourth in the world rankings			1
" it is time to start a new chapter in life , " the 33 - year - old , who became a father for the first time in 2010 , said in a statement on his official website on thursday			2
the @entity19 made headlines in 1997 when he reached the quarterfinals of @entity22 at the tender age of 19 , and won his home tournament in @entity25 two years later -- the third of his six titles on the @entity27 as he earned more than $ 7 million on the circuit			1
he went on to claim an @entity30 silver medal in doubles in 2004 with compatriot @entity32 , before progressing to the last four of the @entity33 in 2006 -- his best performance in a grand slam			1
what were the top tennis moments of 2010 ? however , after suffering a wrist injury that year , the player tipped to follow in the footsteps of six - time major winner @entity2 has struggled to get back to the top of the game , playing on the lowly @entity44 and slipping to a world ranking of just 722			1
" that 's going to follow me around my whole life , but that 's okay , " @entity3 said of the comparisons in an exclusive interview with @entity19 newspaper @entity48			1
" there can only be one @entity2			0
he was my biggest motivator			0
i learned the most from him , and i 'm very grateful to him for that			0
" sometimes i just missed out by a pinch			0
but that 's what makes the difference between a @entity2 and someone not so successful			0
" despite having previously said he wanted to continue playing until the @entity62 , @entity3 is now looking forward to a new life away from the court with girlfriend @entity65 and five - month - old daughter @entity66			1
" a couple of days ago i looked in the mirror and said to myself -- come on , you 've had a great career , you 've met lots of great people , traveled to lots of countries , and learnt so much			2
you 're a father now , you have a daughter , " he said			2
" the last few times i was away , i 've known what i 've been missing			0
every evening i fall asleep next to my daughter @entity78			2
every morning i wake up next to her			0
those are moments i do n't want to miss. " known as " @entity81 " to his fans , @entity3 will have more time to concentrate on interests away from tennis , including his favorite football team @entity85 -- for whom he scored a goal while playing in a friendly match in 2005			1
@entity3 is also studying for a degree in sports management , and he told @entity48 that he may return to tennis in the future utilizing his newfound skills			1
