@entity0 -- thirty years ago , the mention of a social ball would have made most @entity5 cringe -- it was regarded as a typical derivative of capitalism			1
however this year , @entity0 hosted its first @entity8 , and an invitation to the high - society event is becoming the new status symbol in the city			1
@entity13 , 39 , a @entity0 - born beauty contest organizer , was one of 150 guests who sipped champagne under chandeliers at the invitation - only event held in january			1
" the ball was elegant , noble and very ceremonial , " he says			0
" it had a very strong upper - class feeling			0
" now , a second ball is on its way			0
in the @entity24 , a debutante ball is the " coming - out party " for daughters of the rich , famed and powerful			1
in the @entity28 's colonial - style ballroom , @entity13 witnessed 13 ladies making their debut into high society , donning traditional white gowns and dripping with rmb 60 million ( us $ 9.5 million ) worth of jewelry and tiaras			1
this is one of @entity0 's most luxurious venues			0
a dinner for two could easily run to rmb 1,000 ( us $ 158 ) , about one - third of the monthly salary of an average @entity5 person			1
@entity13 says he enjoyed it			0
" the event is good for shaping the elite class of socialism , " he explains			0
" our society needs elites like ( the debutantes ) to help build positive social morality and establish correct values			2
" up until the mid- 1980s , communist @entity5 regarded farmers and workers as the noblest people of all			2
" in today 's mainland @entity5 , there are only two renditions of the high society : money and power , " @entity13 comments			1
@entity5 socialite @entity62 , 66 , is the brains behind the ball			1
the daughter of late @entity68 master @entity67 , the homegrown dame will host her next cotillion at the @entity0 in january 2013			1
" ( i brought the ball to @entity5 because ) i think the time is right , " says @entity70 , who moved to @entity71 with her family in 1959 and has since studied and lived in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
with the exposure of mainland girls taking part in other debutante balls in the @entity24 , @entity70 reckons there is room for one in @entity5 " where the girls are striving to have a certain quality of life other than brand names and materialistic things			1
" the first @entity89 did not invite any ladies from the mainland ( 13 debs aged between 16 - 25 came from @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity71 and @entity95 ) , but eligible daughters of the @entity98 elite or " red princesses " have waltzed at @entity100 des @entity101 © butantes , the annual @entity103 in @entity104 , for the past decade			1
@entity105 was the first to attend the @entity104 event in 2003			0
the @entity108 - born jewelry designer is the granddaughter of @entity109 , who , among other titles , served as the former vice premier of the @entity112 in the ' 80s			0
@entity105 's debut was followed by @entity115 in 2006 , whose father governs the @entity117			2
@entity115 's grandfather , @entity118 , was a founding member of the @entity5 and a high - ranking official in the country until the late 1980s , according to want @entity121			1
and , @entity122 , a young debutante said be the granddaughter of a current member of the @entity125 , was reported to have attended the @entity126 in 2009			2
" many people on the @entity134 have raised questions about the attendance of @entity5 debutantes such as @entity105 and @entity115 , " says @entity127 , 31 , editor from @entity128 , an @entity130 blog focusing on the social media reaction to @entity5 news			1
" ( @entity138 said ) their ancestors were @entity140 or @entity141			0
strictly speaking , they ca n't be the ' @entity5 royalty , ' " adds @entity127 , who hails from @entity142 and graduated from @entity143			2
in a country that deposed its last emperor , @entity148 , one century ago , many are questioning the meaning of the " upper class " in today 's society , continues @entity127			0
@entity5 - based etiquette trainer @entity152 thinks @entity5 needs five to 10 years to mature for a debutante ball			1
" it is not the right time yet and too early for social acceptance of such occasions since there is still not an established environment that advocates such exclusive activities , " says @entity152 , 39 , who owns a boutique etiquette consultancy in @entity0			0
the lack of strong candidates is another challenge			0
" a qualified debutante will take years of personal training and development , " adds @entity164 " @entity5 has seen its economy growing at a very rapid pace in the last 10 years , but soft skills lag behind its current development			2
" @entity70 reveals that two or three debs from the mainland , who she met after january , will attend her next ball			2
she stresses her debs do n't necessarily need to have a wealthy family or a strong lineage ( " though a strong lineage helps " ) , but they must have the elegance , quality , and style of a modern woman			0
this entails a proper family upbringing and preferably education in the @entity24			0
in addition , they must have a " good family background			0
" " good family background in today 's @entity5 means a family without any scandals , such as corruption , " says @entity70			2
@entity127 says the @entity89 has yet to receive attention from @entity5 netizens due to the lack of mainland debs in the first one , but if the future selected ladies are princelings , this could cause controversy			2
" however , people will be more tolerant if they turn out to be daughters or granddaughters of pure businessmen			0
" this sharp reality has n't escaped organizer @entity70 , who claims that her debutante ball " will have nothing to do with children of @entity5 government officials			1
" she adds , " i personally prefer girls from private enterprises because that makes life easier for everybody			0
