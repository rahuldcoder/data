-- " @entity1 " has now been on tv for longer than some of @entity5 's viewers have been alive			1
having aired 532 episodes filmed in 21 cities over 26 seasons , " @entity1 " celebrates its 20th anniversary this week			1
despite being one of the longest - running reality programs on tv , it seems viewers still are n't sick of seeing " what happens ... when people stop being polite ... and start getting real			1
" the september 2011 premiere of the series ' most recent season , " @entity1 : @entity19 , " drew nearly 2 million viewers			1
clocking in as the no. 1 original cable series of the night , the premiere marked the show 's best debut in five seasons , according to @entity25			1
but " @entity1 's " cultural significance extends far beyond the number of people who tune in these days			1
" ' @entity1 ' was definitely the first show to put people into a house to live together , " said @entity30 , co-creator and executive producer of the series			1
it also introduced the " confessional " -- a room where cast members can go to speak directly into the camera and comment on their actions , @entity30 said			0
@entity45 ' " @entity44 , " which began airing in the @entity46 in 2000 , borrowed " @entity1 's " format , adding a competitive element			1
even @entity5 's shinier and newer reality program , " @entity48 , " which attracted between 4 million and 7 million viewers throughout its fifth season , can attribute some of its success to the long - running series			1
" we 've seen certain shows like ' newlyweds ' or ' the @entity56 ' or ' @entity48 ' come along , and somehow , ' @entity1 ' keeps coming back while some of those other shows have their super bright nova in the sky , " @entity30 said			2
the show had somewhat humble beginnings			0
a 2007 @entity64 story noted that @entity5 originally wanted the series to have a soap opera - feel			0
then @entity5 chief @entity67 told the publication that the show is " quite simply the undisputed granddaddy of modern , commercial reality television			0
" @entity30 says the same things that originally made the series such a dark horse , including featuring a new cast and location each season , are what inevitably led to " @entity1 's " longevity			2
" the fact that we do change the cast every season , and we do change the location , " he said , " it keeps it fresh and it allows the show to very much reflect what 's in the minds of young people			2
" in some ways the show was groundbreaking			0
in 1994 's " @entity1 : @entity95 , " cast member @entity92 shared his struggle with hiv / aids			2
after @entity92 died in november 1994 , president @entity96 said the @entity100 - born reality star " changed the face of @entity98 and @entity94 in @entity46 forever			0
" " ' @entity95 ' was just , for most of us who 've worked on the show , an incredibly important season because of @entity92 's involvement , " @entity30 said , adding , @entity92 's story took " @entity1 " out of the entertainment section and placed it on the front page			1
that season , the series ' third , is when @entity30 said he knew " @entity1 " was special			2
he said he remembers thinking , " maybe we 'll get another five seasons			0
" since then , the show has tackled a number of previously taboo issues			0
perhaps one of the series ' most memorable cast members , @entity120 , appeared on season eight , " @entity1 : @entity122			2
" @entity120 's drinking problem , which eventually resulted in her temporarily leaving the show to enter a rehab center , shed a light on how young people cope with substance abuse , @entity30 said			2
" the show , from the very beginning , was built on the idea that we were going to put seven diverse people into a house together , " @entity30 said			1
" and so , the dna of the show has always been diversity			0
... and over the years , we 've explored that diversity in every way possible			0
" @entity30 's current goal is to make it to 30 seasons , which is just around the corner considering that the 27th season , " @entity1 : @entity146 " is set to air on @entity5 this summer			0
and he said a 28th season has already been ordered			0
" what 's amazing about ' @entity1 ' is that every four years , in a sense , a new audience grows up into it , " @entity30 said , adding that he always hears people say things like , " ' @entity151 season was the best ( yet ) , ' and they 've never even heard of that first @entity150 ( which premiered in 2002 ) with @entity153 ( @entity154 )			1
" but @entity30 's biggest fear is n't that the series wo n't hit its silver anniversary : " i 'm scared for the day that we actually have someone apply to be on the show who 's the son or daughter of someone who has been on the show			0
