-- the chief executive of @entity3 club @entity2 has urged the team 's supporters to get behind under - fire coach @entity6			1
@entity7 told the north @entity10 team 's fans that @entity6 was the best man for the job on the day that @entity2 announced pre-tax profits of $ 78 million for the six months until the end of november			1
the club 's healthy financial situation off the field is diluted by a precarious one on it , because despite sunday 's 5 - 2 thrashing of local rivals @entity19 , the @entity18 are in a battle to finish fourth and claim @entity24 's final , lucrative @entity23 spot			1
@entity6 , from @entity25 , has delivered three @entity3 titles and four @entity27 during his 15 - year reign and has never failed to qualify for the continent 's most prestigious club competition			1
@entity2 fight back to win sensational north @entity10 derby but the team have been below par this season , and are in fourth place only on goal difference , ahead of @entity10 rivals @entity36 , and 17 points off leaders @entity38			1
" we hear the noise , we understand the concern of the fans , we know that there are issues , we know we 're not where we want to be , " @entity7 told @entity2 's official website on monday			1
" but i can tell you that this team , our manager , the players , are absolutely united in what we have to do for the rest of the season , which is to finish in the top four			1
it 's very much in our hands			0
the strength of this club has always been its unity and our fans and our players need to come together in this fight for the rest of the season			2
'' the early - season sales of @entity66 to @entity67 and @entity68 to @entity38 helped @entity2 post such healthy profits			1
during the same period in 2010 the club made a loss of $ 9.6 million			2
@entity7 confirmed there was money available to spend on players but said that @entity77 's new @entity76 regulations , which aim to make football clubs more sustainable and live within their means , would help moderate a voracious market			2
should @entity38 accept @entity82 's apology ? " we have a healthy cash balance of Â £ 115 million ( $ 181 million ) for the half year			2
but it 's important to understand that not all that money 's available to invest in transfers			0
we have running costs of the club , player salaries and so on , so that amount goes down during the year , " @entity7 said			0
" we also have to keep something in reserve in case things do n't go our way			0
there is money available , we do n't talk about an exact figure -- and there 's a very good reason why we do n't put an exact figure on that -- because it would impact on our negotiating position			0
" we have to invest efficiently , we have to invest sensibly			0
that does n't mean we get every decision right -- we do n't			0
but we do get the majority of them right and that 's been one of the secrets of @entity2 's success over a long period of time			1
" meanwhile , the @entity112 has charged three players with making alleged homophobic statements on social networking site @entity116			1
@entity118 's @entity117 , who is on loan at @entity120 , @entity122 's @entity121 and @entity123 of third division @entity124 stand accused of bringing the game into disrepute			0
an @entity112 statement read : " the charge is that the players acted in a way which was improper and / or brought the game into disrepute			2
it is further alleged that the breach included a reference to a person 's or persons ' sexual orientation			0
" the trio have until wednesday to respond to the charges .			0
