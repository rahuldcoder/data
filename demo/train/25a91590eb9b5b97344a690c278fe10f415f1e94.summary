@entity11 's @entity6 is yet to go on sale outside the @entity13 @entity11 's @entity6 , released in the @entity13 two months ago , was engineered to operate for the first two years only on the @entity10 system through an exclusive arrangement between @entity11 and @entity10			1
it has not yet been sold outside of the @entity13 @entity0 software consultant @entity16 , who is not affiliated with the developers , demonstrated the software for @entity1 friday evening			1
an iphone that had the new software appeared to work on the @entity22 system just seconds after @entity16 replaced the @entity10 sim card with a @entity22 sim card			1
" it 's completely software hacked , " @entity16 said			2
" there 's no case opening required			0

@entity11 spokeswoman @entity43 told @entity1 her company has no comment			2
@entity10 spokesman @entity46 said he could n't speculate on the legality of unlocking the phone , but he added , " when you sign up , you 're signing a two - year contract			1
