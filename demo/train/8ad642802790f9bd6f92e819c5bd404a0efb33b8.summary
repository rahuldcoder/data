-- when the @entity2 announces new rules to protect the nation from the effects of carbon pollution on monday , i 'll take it as a walloping dose of hope			1
i say that not just because i 'm the executive director of a national environmental organization , but because , like too many @entity11 -- like too many people worldwide -- i 've already witnessed the effects of climate disruption			1
a month after @entity15 battered the eastern seaboard , i returned to @entity17 , @entity18			0
the quiet town where i grew up and my family still lives , was hard to recognize			0
surging tides had flooded the first floors of almost every home and yards were piled high with storm - ruined couches , chairs , toys and appliances			0
the @entity2 's proposed first - ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants represent not only a huge step toward curbing the climate disruption that spurs this sort of mutant weather , but also an important milestone on the way to powering the nation with energy that will make our air and water cleaner and our families safer and healthier			1
it 's no secret why these standards are urgently needed			1
the @entity47 released last month laid out in sobering detail the range of problems the climate crisis is already triggering			1
we can still temper the severity of those problems , but only if we dramatically increase the pace of cutting carbon pollution during the next couple of decades			2
focusing on power plants , which are our nation 's single largest source of carbon pollution , is a common - sense and essential step that we can take right now			1
the urgency of avoiding the most severe problems for our climate is underscored by the disruption we have already seen			1
the effects of carbon pollution are no longer an abstraction			1
heat waves , historic droughts , unprecedented wildfire seasons , and destructive storms have become the new norm , and the climate scientists and insurance companies that study these patterns meticulously are n't the only ones that have noticed			2
real people are being hurt , and serious economic consequences are being felt -- whether you 're talking about how drought threatens farmers in @entity84 and @entity85 or how superstorms like @entity15 have devastated entire communities ( including my hometown in @entity18 )			0
the unfortunate reality is that if you have n't already experienced extreme weather , odds are that you soon will			0
@entity93 : take the path to clean energy most @entity11 are unaware that the coal - and gas - fired power plants that emit such a huge percentage of our nation 's carbon pollution currently have no limits whatsoever on how much carbon they can dump into our atmosphere			1
thanks to the @entity106 , we currently limit how much mercury , arsenic , soot , and other air pollution power can come from power plants , yet when it comes to carbon pollution , power plants have been given a free pass			2
common sense demands that we close that loophole as fast as possible , which is why a february 2014 poll found that 7 of 10 @entity11 are in favor of setting limits on carbon pollution from power plants			1
the @entity2 is now acting to curb this pollution because the @entity106 ( which was passed by @entity124 ) requires that it do so ( as confirmed by the @entity125 )			0
but just because something is required by law ( not to mention morally mandated ) is not enough to guarantee it will actually happen			0
president @entity129 deserves huge credit for making these pollution limits part of his @entity133 and directing his administration to act			1
as @entity129 has said , our responsibility does n't end with cleaning up carbon pollution			1
we must also ensure that the transition from the most polluting power plants to cleaner technologies does not harm the working families and communities that may depend on them for jobs			0
fortunately , we know that the same clean energy technologies that produce less carbon pollution can also create a new generation of clean energy jobs			2
the benefits of investments in wind and solar , for example , create three times as many jobs as investments in fossil fuels			2
we also know that controlling air pollution has historically more than paid for itself by reducing sick days , crop damage , health disasters and hospital visits			1
since 1970 , every dollar invested in compliance with @entity106 standards has yielded $ 4 to $ 8 in economic benefits			2
some day soon , actuaries no doubt will put a dollar figure on the huge economic benefit of moving away from fossil fuels and toward a future that is powered entirely by clean , renewable , carbon - free sources			2
in the meantime , we know that coal pollution alone is responsible for more than 12,000 emergency room visits per year			0
fracking for natural gas damages the land , pollutes our water and air , and risks the health of surrounding communities			2
fortunately , renewable energy is up to the challenge of replacing those dirty fuels			0
in just the last three years , solar panels have gotten 60 % cheaper and the price of wind energy has fallen more than 40 %			0
far from being expensive , clean energy is already beating both coal and natural gas on price in many parts of the country			0
without question , curbing carbon pollution is an obligation that we owe to all the generations that will be forced to live with the consequences of the decisions we make today			0
beyond that , though , it is an amazing opportunity to prosper right now			0
already , far - sighted investors are recognizing the obvious -- that coal , oil and gas are 19th century fuels whose time has passed -- and putting their money into the renewable energy sources that are increasingly powering the 21st century			0
by creating these first - ever standards to clean up carbon pollution and make polluters take responsibility for the harm they cause , the @entity2 is moving our nation toward the cleaner , healthier , and more prosperous future today 's workers need and our children deserve .			1

@entity224 : many @entity11 have already witnessed effects of climate disruption
controlling pollutions pays for itself in health benefits , he says
the @entity129 administration 's new rules on carbon emissions are a step *forward* , @entity224 says
