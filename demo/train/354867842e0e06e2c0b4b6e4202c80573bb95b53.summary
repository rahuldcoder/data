-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 and the " no " campaign are entitled to savor their victory in the referendum on @entity8 independence			1
at the end of the day , the @entity10 flag still flies with @entity8 's @entity12			2
but @entity1 and the no campaign should resist the temptation to whistle past the graveyard of @entity8 nationalism			1
despite the success of the no vote , the genie of nationalism is now out of the bottle			1
fourty - five percent of the @entity8 voters opted for straight - out independence in a referendum in which they faced the stark choice of severing the fraternal bonds of the @entity2 entirely or sticking with an unpalatable status quo			1
had the referendum included a middle way calling for greater autonomy for @entity8 within the union , it would no doubt have won by a landslide			1
only dire predictions of life alone in the cold bolstered by last - minute promises of greater autonomy if @entity8 stayed kept the @entity40 campaign in a bare minority			1
one could fairly criticize @entity44 leader @entity43 for pushing the @entity2 to the brink of a @entity47 divorce with @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50			0
but we should not ignore the @entity2 government 's part in this political drama			0
@entity1 and his colleagues under - estimated the strength of @entity8 nationalism until the 11th hour and then , in panic , gave away the middle ground of greater autonomy that the prime minister had initially refused to put on the ballot			1
many of those promises of greater autonomy and home - rule north of the @entity66 will now have to be kept at significant cost			1
and @entity69 's concessions to @entity70 are likely to accelerate the " devolution revolution " in other parts of the @entity2 , including @entity48 itself , which will further federalize it , shifting @entity2 politics in unexpected directions			0
things will be interesting going forward both in @entity8 and other regions of @entity79 as a result			2
last night 's victors should also keep in mind that nationalism often flourishes in defeat -- for example , the well - spring of the @entity87 nationalism that caused so much turmoil in the @entity89 during the 1990s was the loss of the @entity91 to the @entity92 625 years ago			1
@entity8 nationalism is equally durable in the face of adversity			1
the @entity48 king @entity95 captured @entity8 rebel @entity96 in 1305 and publically eviscerated him in an attempt to smother the flames of resistance to @entity48 rule			2
but a scant nine years later @entity101 secured the independence of his throne at the @entity104			0
while ethnic , linguistic , and religious separatist sentiment waxes and wanes in the modern era , it still persists despite set - backs			2
quebecois separatism in @entity110 was defeated handily at the polls in 1980 but came back again with even greater support in 1995 , only narrowly failing that time			2
it is important for the developed world to acknowledge and accommodate nationalist sentiment because as we have seen many other places in the world , when repressed it often explodes in violence			0
the breakup of the great colonial empires after @entity122 saw one wave of violent separatism crest , its nationalist substructure obscured by the ideological overlay of the @entity127			0
a @entity129 wave destroyed the new @entity131 identities in the @entity132 and @entity133 and clearly highlighted the persistence of nationalism in modern politics			0
today , the fragmenting of the artificial states of the @entity139 -- particularly @entity140 and @entity141 -- and the @entity142 emphasize the marriage of national with religious identities as the bedrock of @entity147 political identity in many parts of the world			0
while hardly anyone expects the violence that characterized nationalist struggle on the margins or outside of the developed world will spill over into @entity155 , there are plenty of nations - without - states there who watched events in @entity8 with more than a passing interest			1
the @entity161 and @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164 in @entity163 and @entity165 , the @entity166 in @entity167 , the @entity168 in @entity165 , and the @entity169 in @entity170 all chafe to a greater or lesser extent under the rule of other peoples			0
the challenge for @entity79 and the other countries in the developed world facing calls for greater autonomy by proto - nationalist groups is to respond effectively within their democratic processes to demands for greater autonomy			1
the first step is not to be taken by surprise by separatism 's persistence ; the second is to respond to it with meaningful change before it reaches a crisis			0
this will be tricky , as the last few months in the @entity2 amply demonstrate , but they face no choice			0
the future of challenge of world politics will remain the sorting out the incongruity between formal political structures and actual political identities			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2
