-- @entity2 residents and recovery crews continued their cleanup efforts saturday , two days after powerful winds downed power lines , damaged structures and caused other devastation			1
" from what we have been told , this was probably the worst windstorm to hit this particular area in over a decade , " said @entity9 , a spokesman for the @entity10			1
while the weather was good saturday , with clear skies and high temperatures in the 60s , that did n't mean the headaches were over			2
residents still faced the prospect of new wildfires breaking out and spreading -- as evidenced by the red - flag warning in effect through sunday morning in @entity27 and @entity28 counties			1
the @entity29 issued the warning -- which means that conditions are favorable for fire to grow rapidly if it ignites -- through sunday morning due to gusty northeast winds and low relative humidity			0
the strong winds that continued to blow saturday , though , were well short of the hurricane - force gusts measured thursday and friday			2
it was an extreme manifestation of a regional reality : @entity39 winds , a condition in which strong winds descend to the @entity42 around @entity27 from inland desert regions , according to the @entity29			1
the weather service reported gusts stronger than 140 mph along the @entity47 mountain ridge , while there were roughly 100 mph - hour winds in the @entity50 of southern @entity2 , said @entity52 spokesman @entity51			0
widespread damage in southwestern @entity2 led @entity55 @entity54 to issue a state of emergency " to ensure that state and federal financial resources are available to serve county residents impacted by the windstorms			0
" the effects are still being felt			0
@entity52 , for example , had 77,400 customers still without power as of 5 p.m. pt ( 8 p.m. et ) on saturday , said @entity51			2
and the @entity27 @entity65 reported in an online news release that , as of 3 p.m. , about 7,000 households in its coverage area still did n't have electricity			1
those numbers , while significant , mark a major drop from those reported several days ago			0
more than 200,000 of the @entity27 utility 's customers did n't have power at one point , while @entity52 had about 250,000 in the dark , said @entity51			1
" four hours ago , we had over 90,000 customers without power , " @entity51 said early saturday evening			1
" that tells you crews are making progress , rather than responding to more outages			0
" communities along the @entity50 foothills , where he lives -- including @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 -- suffered especially extensive damage in @entity52 's territory			0
@entity51 said that the utility had more than 500 personnel out working and urged residents to steer clear of power - lines for their own safety			2
@entity27 also had " several hundred personnel spanned out across " the county to deal with fallen trees and clear out debris , said @entity9			1
that includes 50 county public works personnel alone in the hard - hit city of @entity107 , with the spokesman estimating they would be there for at least a week			2
one positive , aside from gusty if not likely damaging winds , is that the weather appears to be cooperating			0
in @entity107 , conditions are forecast to be sunny or mostly sunny , with day - time highs in 60s and nighttime lows in the 40s , all next week , according to the weather service .			0

*85,000* households were still without power saturday evening , two utilities report
hundreds of utility and public workers are out to clean up debris , *restore* power
