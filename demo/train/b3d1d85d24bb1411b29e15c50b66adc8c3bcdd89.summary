-- dear @entity1 , i did n't start playing soccer imagining i would be scoring goals in the @entity5 or representing my country at the @entity7			1
i started playing soccer , and sports in general , as a way to simply make friends			1
on the field , i was able to hang out with kids my age , kick the ball around and just have a good time			1
what i did n't realize at the time was that soccer would do more for me than i could ever imagine			1
at a young age , soccer taught me about leadership and sportsmanship and what it means to be a good teammate			1
most importantly , it taught me the power of confidence			1
confidence is not something that is always easy to find			2
often , being the new girl on a team or being in a group breeds insecurities			2
i have joined countless teams where i was the new girl , and i was never immune to those feelings of self - doubt			2
i have learned that by pushing aside those insecurities and rediscovering my inner confidence , i become a better teammate and person			2
that 's why i wrote the book series , " @entity46 , " to show girls the importance of maintaining confidence when faced with new ( and sometimes scary ! ) opportunities			1
while the book is aimed at middle schoolers , the lessons in it are ones that i think hold true across all ages			0
joining the @entity53 was intimidating to say the least			0
i joined a team with women who i had looked up to for years , and at just 20 , how was i supposed to fit in with them ? i was nervous and overwhelmed			0
but i knew that i was capable of competing with them so i pushed myself outside of my comfort zone in order to be the best player i could be			0
i now call these girls more than just my friends			1
they are my sisters , and together we support each other through thick and thin			0
i 'm so grateful to have some amazing women around me to help me learn and grow			0
confidence has carried me on and off the pitch , through high school in @entity69 , college at @entity71 and now professionally for the @entity73 @entity72 and the @entity74			0
i have had to adjust to new surroundings , meet new people and have been challenged by different situations			0
all of those experiences , while nerve - wracking at the time , have empowered me to grow stronger			0
it 's important that as women , we stand up for ourselves , stand up for our peers and show the power that confidence can have for women everywhere			0
