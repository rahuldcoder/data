passengers aboard @entity1 were waiting on the tarmac at @entity4 's @entity3 when their pilot came on the intercom			1
" we 've been notified about a health emergency aboard the aircraft , " passenger @entity7 heard			1
a few minutes later , @entity7 saw a flight attendant walk toward another passenger sitting a few rows ahead of him			0
the flight attendant handed the slender middle - aged man a medical mask			1
emergency personnel boarded the plane a short time later and removed the man , @entity7 said			1
a firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed			1
he advised them to contact their physicians immediately , @entity7 said			0
@entity29 health officials are not recommending passengers on the plane seek medical care because their risk of being infected with tuberculosis is " very , very low , " said dr. @entity35 , disease control director for @entity37			1
" to put this in perspective ... we 're much more concerned that the passengers on this flight contracted influenza than that they contracted @entity45 , " she said			1
the @entity1 flight took off from @entity47 , @entity48 , on friday , according to airline spokesman @entity49			1
it landed in @entity4 approximately two hours later on a layover before it was scheduled to fly to @entity52			1
there was no warning or flag on the passenger 's record when he was going through security or when he boarded the plane , @entity49 said			1
after the plane took off , the @entity60 notified the @entity62 of a possible risk			1
the @entity62 then notified @entity1 , @entity49 said			2
the passenger in question has not been confirmed to have an infectious disease , @entity60 spokeswoman @entity64 said sunday			1
" and even if a passenger had infectious @entity45 , the duration of the flight was so short that there would likely be no risk of exposure to other passengers			1
" another spokesperson for the @entity60 said monday the government organization is still waiting on test results for the passenger , a @entity79 citizen who was traveling internationally			1
fast facts about tuberculosis @entity45 is caused by a bacterium called @entity83 , which mainly affects the lungs			1
it can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys , spine and brain			0
there are two types of @entity45 : latent @entity45 infection , which is not contagious , and @entity45 disease , which is contagious			2
a person infected with latent @entity45 shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick			2
someone with @entity45 disease usually feels ill ; they may be coughing up blood and may have a fever , night sweats and / or chest pain			2
@entity45 spreads through the air when a person with an active @entity45 infection coughs , sneezes or speaks			2
germs can stay in the air for hours , but the risk in this case was very small , said dr. @entity111 , an expert on infectious diseases at @entity113			0
" the risk is greatest for people sitting two rows ahead of and two rows behind the individuals , " @entity111 said			0
" we do n't have to worry about the blankets and seat rests and the like			0
it 's how the air is transmitted and handled in the plane			0
" @entity111 said passengers on the plane should have a tb skin test done by their local health care provider			1
people who contract @entity45 must take several medications for six to nine months to combat the infection , according to the @entity60			1
some varieties of the @entity45 bacterium have developed a resistance to common antibiotics and may be more difficult to treat			2
people with weakened immune systems , such as those with @entity140 , are particularly susceptible to the disease			0
the number of @entity45 cases in the @entity79 has been declining since 1992 , according to the @entity60			1
in 2010 , the most recent @entity60 data available , there were 569 deaths from @entity45			1
@entity7 was flying home from @entity47 , where he had been visiting his daughter for @entity149			0
he said other passengers told him the potentially infected man appeared " awkward " before and during the flight , continually rubbing his face			2
@entity7 plans to get in touch with his doctor monday morning			0
he said he has not heard from @entity1 about the incident			2
in january 2010 , a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew from @entity160 to @entity161 on @entity1 despite being on the @entity60 's " @entity165 " list , which is different from the @entity62 's " @entity164 " list			1
the @entity165 list was created in 2007 after @entity169 lawyer @entity167 traveled abroad with a drug - resistant case of tuberculosis , setting off an international health scare			2
speaker insisted that he had not been told he was contagious ; public health officials disagreed			1
the @entity60 manages the @entity165 list in coordination with the @entity176			2
the list is authorized under the @entity178 of 2001 , according to the @entity60			2
local and state health officials can contact the @entity60 to request that someone be placed on the list			1
" to include someone on the list , @entity60 must determine that the person 1 ) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight ; 2 ) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations , including treatment ; and 3 ) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft , " the @entity60 website states			1
" once a person is placed on the list , airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass to the person for any commercial domestic flight or for any commercial international flight arriving in or departing from the @entity79			0
" the @entity165 list does not apply to other methods of transportation			0
the @entity60 reviews the records of every person on the list every two weeks to see whether they are eligible to fly again			0
in general , airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick , said @entity207 , an attorney who specializes in travel law			0
unlike cruise lines , which require you to disclose illnesses leading up to the cruise , he said , airlines do not include any language in the ticket purchasing process that would prevent you from traveling			0
" if you have some disease and its contagious , where 's the threshold ? " he asked			0
" if you have the flu ? if you have a really bad cold ? i think that once you establish some rule that there has to be notification , it becomes a slippery slope			0
" as a " common carrier , " @entity207 said , airlines are legally required to do as much as possible to ensure the safety of their passengers			0
if a passenger appears too ill to survive the flight without medical assistance , an airline could prevent him from flying , he said			0
or if the airline knew that a passenger had a contagious disease , employees could require her to wear a mask during the flight to prevent germs from spreading			0
in this kind of situation , any legal troubles would more likely stem from a civil lawsuit			0
after the 2007 incident , speaker was sued by eight of his fellow passengers in a @entity251 court			0
@entity207 said plaintiffs would have to show that the infected passenger knew that he had the disease and was extremely careless around his fellow travelers			0
" the line is crossed when the person knows they 're sick and intentionally tries to do something ( to infect others ) or acts with callous disregard for your well - being , " @entity207 said .			0
