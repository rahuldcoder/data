most anyone who has snacked on a @entity1 or thrown down a @entity2 knows they can be hard to resist			0
but selling them ? one girl scout in @entity6 has found that she , too , just ca n't get enough			1
having broken her state record for cookie sales two years running , @entity8 did herself -- and everyone else , ever -- one better this year by selling more than 18,000 boxes of girl scout cookies			1
" i 'm really , really happy , " the sixth - grader told @entity16 affiliate @entity15			0
" i can go around knowing that i now hold a world record			1
" the @entity19 , of course , are about more than baked goods			0
since its founding in @entity23 , @entity24 , in 1912 , the group has grown in its mission to give millions of young women a forum to build " courage , confidence and character , " according to its website			0
that said , especially in recent decades -- and perhaps especially for those not directly involved in scouting beyond buying a box -- the @entity19 have also become synonymous with do - si - dos , @entity1 , @entity36 and other popular cookies			2
selling them is important to local councils , bringing in money that 's used to offer scouting opportunities for some , maintain camps and the like			2
cookie sales ' importance is one reason why , every year , you can reliably see @entity19 out and about asking you to buy a box			2
@entity8 , though , officially took salesmanship to a whole new level			2
" @entity8 is an example of the entrepreneurial spirit and can - do attitude that exemplifies @entity19 , " the organization 's ceo , @entity50 , said tuesday			1
in her four years as a cookie - selling scout , the member of @entity56 has always been a big - time seller			1
this time around , she decided to go even bigger -- aiming for not just a state record , but a world record			1
why ? her mother , @entity61 , told @entity15 admits , " it 's very time consuming , and it takes a lot of energy , and a lot of adrenaline			0
" thankfully , the northwest @entity69 resident does n't seem to be lacking in the energy or eagerness department			0
" cookie selling is just so much fun for me , " @entity8 said			1
for three weeks , every day after school and on weekends , she pitched her products door to door			0
after that , @entity8 set up booths at hot spots and stores around @entity69			1
every step was monitored , such that if the hourly sales goal was n't met , she and her mother would head somewhere else			0
sometimes the cookies practically sold themselves			0
but the 12 - year - old also offered incentives , like drawings for prizes , and a little song and dance to lure customers			0
@entity8 recalled : " some people bought cookies only because they saw me singing			1
" when she found out she 'd broken the record dating to the 1980s , @entity8 said she was the one dancing , she was so excited			1
what this achievement did not do , however , was break her cookie - selling groove			2
in fact , she 's still at it			0
@entity8 hopes to smash the 20,000 - cookie mark before the official end date for cookie sales on sunday , march 30			1
to put this milestone in perspective , nationally each @entity106 sells 150 boxes a year on average			2
she and her mom have wagons and a hatchback car packed with shortbread cookies and @entity115 , looking for customers			0
they 're also keeping in mind what @entity8 says are the three ingredients for cookie - selling success			1
as she explained : " it takes a lot of time , commitment and asking everybody that i see			0
