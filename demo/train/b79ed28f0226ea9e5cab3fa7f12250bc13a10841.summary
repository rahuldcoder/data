@entity1 no civil rights charges will be brought against @entity4 in the february 2012 shooting death of @entity6 , the @entity0 announced tuesday , citing what it said was insufficient evidence			1
@entity4 was acquitted of criminal charges in 2013 in the killing of the 17 - year - old @entity6 , who was black			1
" though a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution can not be met under the circumstances here , this young man 's premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface , " attorney general @entity11 said in a news release			1
" we , as a nation , must take concrete steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future			0
" @entity0 prosecutors and officials from the @entity34 met with @entity6 's family on tuesday to inform them of the decision , the department said			1
in a tuesday afternoon statement , the family thanked the @entity0 for its investigation and " millions of people around the world " who supported them			2
" although we are disappointed in these findings , it has steeled our resolve to continue traveling the country with the message of the @entity48 , which is dedicated to protecting our youth and empowering those who demand justice and peace , " the statement said			0
" we remain poised to do everything in our power to help eradicate senseless violence in our communities , because we do n't want any other parent to experience the unexplainable loss we have endured			0
we will never , ever forget what happened to our son , @entity61 , and will honor his memory by working tirelessly to make the world a better place			2
" the case stirred a groundswell of emotion , much of it centered around race			0
civil rights leaders , as well as @entity6 's relatives , took to the streets contending that the teen -- who 'd gone out to get a drink and @entity75 from a @entity77 , @entity78 , convenience store only to run into @entity4 on his way back -- might still be alive today if not for the color of his skin			1
@entity4 , then a neighborhood watch volunteer , never denied shooting @entity6			2
but he argued that he did so in self - defense			2
he was n't charged right away -- his second - degree murder charge did n't come down until april 2012			1
that was a month after the @entity0 and @entity34 announced that they had opened an investigation			0
still , the bar was always high to charge @entity4 under federal hate crime laws , as it is for anyone			1
the @entity34 defines a hate crime as " a traditional offense like murder , arson , or vandalism with an added element of bias			1
" proving that a person attacked someone is one thing			0
proving what was going through their mind when they did it -- especially if the other person is dead -- is much harder			0
@entity11 acknowledged the law 's high standard in april 2012 : " something that was reckless , that was negligent does not meet that standard , " @entity11 said			2
" we have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind			0
" @entity2 's @entity117 and @entity118 reported from @entity1 , and @entity2 's @entity119 wrote this story from @entity121 .			0

" we will never , ever forget what happened to our son , " @entity6 's family says
@entity4 was acquitted on a criminal charge of second - degree murder
federal *authorities* had investigated whether to charge him based on hate crime law
