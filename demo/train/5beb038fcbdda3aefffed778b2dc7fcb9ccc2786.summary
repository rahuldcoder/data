-- a trip to @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity4 , @entity5 , unearths a bounty of @entity8 - made artisanal luxuries			1
one day , while standing on a street corner in @entity11 in the late summer , designer @entity9 realized suddenly that august should really mean sunshine and fresh tomatoes			0
the @entity5 native was a successful , @entity16 - based stylist working on a film set in @entity18 at the time , living out of a suitcase and wondering if she had packed enough winter clothes			1
that realization led to an overhaul and reconfiguration of her life , culminating several years later when she returned to her hometown of @entity4 , @entity5 , to launch her sustainable - clothing label , @entity28			1
now in its second evolution as @entity32 , the award - winning line is still based in a warehouse just north of @entity4			1
what about the @entity35 pulled her back and continues to do so for others ? we flew down to find out			1
the south of the northern imagination — that memorialized by @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 — is afflicted by its past and lost in the present			0
ironic , then , that much of this decade 's @entity8 renaissance is built on the foundations of old traditions : quilting , work clothes , garden kitchens , comfort food			0
we once mistook this elegant clarity for oversimplification			0
but in today 's hyper - communicative , superfast , deeply insecure culture , tradition has been reanimated into a new worldly form			0
@entity4 , with a population of 39,000 , sits on the @entity61 in @entity5 's northwestern corner , a two - hour drive from any of the nearest three airports			1
it calls itself " @entity28 's @entity68 " and has more clothing labels than restaurants			0
( visit one of @entity71 's monthly retreats and take a tour of the studio			0
) to fill that void , we flew into @entity2 first — an old metropolis of the @entity35 — for the food alone			1
the longtime music capital has always been home to the creative and the cosmopolitan , but the new two - feet - on - the - ground sophistication of the cooking has attracted the attention of a much wider audience , and the city is having a moment			1
areas outside the city center , like 12th @entity89 and @entity2 , are being reengineered from the inside out			2
an old gas station has been converted into a store for tailored denim by the label @entity95 ; an 18th - century factory building houses @entity96 , one of the best restaurants in town ; and an old trailer is the mobile vintage - clothing store @entity101			2
we crave the locally made finds that have the simplicity of an heirloom tomato			0
and right now , it 's all about returning to roots — something the @entity35 most definitely provides			2
here are our 10 new reasons to love the old @entity35			2

the trip through @entity2 and @entity4 is lined with one - of - a - kind @entity114 *treasures*
