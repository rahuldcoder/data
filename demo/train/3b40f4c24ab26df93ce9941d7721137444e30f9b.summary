@entity0 -- researchers said wednesday for the first time they have found what they believe to be pieces of a burial shroud from the time of @entity8			1
the find is of importance because tests on the shroud and the body it wrapped revealed the earliest proven case of leprosy in the @entity17			1
and in addition , the weave of the shroud raises fresh doubts about the @entity22 , which many people believe was used to wrap the body of @entity8			1
according to researchers involved in the excavation and subsequent testing , the recently discovered shroud lends more credible evidence that the @entity22 does not date to @entity31 times when @entity8 died but from a later period			1
the latest shroud was found in a tomb complex on the edge of the @entity17			0
" this is the first time that we have a shroud from the time of @entity8 , " said @entity36 , the excavation director			2
he called such a find in the @entity0 area unique because the high humidity levels in the city do not normally allow for the preservation of organic material			0
@entity36 said the remains of the man covered in the cloth consisted of different wrappings for the body and the head , which was consistent with burial practices of the era			0
he also said research had shown that the weave of the cloth was a simple one , much different from the more complex @entity22 's			0
the origin of the @entity22 , a burial cloth that some believe bears the image of @entity8 , is a source of great controversy , with many academics arguing it dates from the @entity66 and not the time of @entity8			2
the burial cave , which has been dubbed the @entity68 , was first uncovered in 2000 and was one of more than 70 separate family tombs of the first century			0
it is in a location described in the @entity73 as the " @entity74 , " next to the area where @entity76 , the apostle who betrayed @entity8 , is said to have committed suicide			0
based on the tomb 's location and the style of the shroud wrappings , researchers have said the shrouded man was an affluent member of @entity0 society			2
because of the unique nature of the find , the remains of the shroud and the bodily remains were subject to molecular and dna testing			0
researchers said they were surprised to find that the shrouded man suffered from both leprosy and tuberculosis			1
the discovery of leprosy was found in dna samples taken from the skeletal remains and is the earliest proven case of the disease , according to @entity101 professor @entity100			1
it is likely the shrouded man died from tuberculosis , @entity100 said , and its presence in other remains found at the site suggest " the significant impact social diseases such as tuberculosis had on society from the low socioeconomic groups up to the more affluent families , such as @entity113 in first - century @entity0			2
