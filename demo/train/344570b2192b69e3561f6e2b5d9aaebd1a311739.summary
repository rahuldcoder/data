-- was @entity1 a predator or scavenger ? the question has been a point of controversy in the scientific community for more than a century			1
" you see ' @entity9 , ' and you see @entity1 as this massive hunter and killer , as incredibly vicious			2
but scientists have argued for 100 years that he was too big and too slow to hunt prey and that he was probably a scavenger , an animal that feeds only on dead things , " @entity14 paleontologist @entity13 said			1
@entity13 and researcher @entity20 got what @entity13 described as his " lucky break " when they found the fossil of a duckbill dinosaur 's tail with a tooth in it			1
" the features of the tooth are like fingerprints , and we were able to identify it as @entity1 , " he said			1
they took the fossil to be analyzed at the @entity14 and for a ct scan at the local hospital , where the doctor told them , " it 's too late for your patient			1
" but @entity13 was thrilled at what the fossilized bones told him about the life of the duckbill			0
" we were giddy like schoolkids , " he said			0
" this now returns @entity1 as a predator			2
so the monsters that we see in dinosaurs are real			0
they did go chasing after things , kill them and eat them			2
they actively pursued live prey			0
" the mystery was solved			0
" our evidence is new because we have a @entity1 tooth inside a duckbill dinosaur , that bit it so hard and so viciously that the tooth broke off , the duckbill dinosaur got away , and over the next few years , the wound healed , " @entity13 explained			1
he determined that the duckbill lived long after the attack by comparing the time it took for the bone to heal around the wound with studies done on modern animals			0
" before our evidence , everybody was looking at bite marks and tooth punctures on dinosaur bones and using that evidence for both theories of predation and scavenging			2
they were using the same bit of evidence to argue both sides , " @entity13 said			0
for @entity88 , the discovery brought to life the behaviors of these legendary creatures and proved the @entity1 's place in the prehistoric world			2
" here is @entity1 , one of the biggest animals ever known , 5 - foot - long skull , 40 feet long nose to tail and weighed 7 tons			1
what were these guys doing in the ecosystem ? now we know they were the top feeders			1
" the full study is published in the @entity105			0

some scientists have argued that dinosaur fed only on dead things
researchers say fossil of dinosaur tail with tooth in it proves otherwise
