-- from playing bat and ball in quiet corners of refugee camps to cricket 's most glamorous tournament ; @entity8 's national team , like the country , has come a long way			1
the team 's rise to the biggest stage of them all , the @entity11 , has been nothing short of remarkable -- and equally heartwarming			1
the scenes of jubilation on the pitch as @entity8 recently brushed aside a disappointing @entity20 team could n't have been farther from the reality of life for many @entity8 after decades of conflict and turmoil in their country			1
the first @entity8 learned the game in @entity29 refugee camps , having fled the @entity31 invasion of 1979			1
read more : @entity8 cricket 's battle for acceptance @entity36 was banned completely under the strict @entity38 fundamentalist rule of the @entity39 , between 1996 and 2001 , with pitches and arenas more likely to host an execution than a training session or a match			1
but as the @entity39 lost its grip , sport blossomed , with cricket among those leading the way			1
cut strips appeared across the country and children would use roads as wickets , discarded pieces of wood as bats and wickets			2
and the rest , as they say , is history			2
@entity8 cricket has gone from strength to strength			1
just 12 years ago , the team did n't even officially exist			0
then a few @entity8 expats set up a team in @entity29 and applied for accreditation to global cricket 's organizing body , the @entity71 ( @entity71 )			1
in 2001 , @entity8 became an @entity71 associate member , which meant cricket was recognized as an established sport in the country			1
it was a start , but little more than that			0
in 2008 , the team played its first matches in division five of the @entity71 's global league -- against @entity82 and the tiny island of @entity84 , a self - governing @entity85 off the coast of northern @entity87			2
that 's as low as world cricket goes			2
but by winning the league , the players gave themselves a chance of qualifying for the @entity93			0
ultimately that proved to be a step too far , too soon , as they came up short			0
but it was n't all bad news			0
the team did enough in the qualifiers to be granted the status of an international one - day team			2
they went on to qualify for the world @entity104 , a shortened form of the game , in 2010 and again in 2012			0
despite some respectable performances , they did little to surprise the bookies and fell during the initial knock - out stage			2
but now , what appeared to be nothing more than a dream just a few short years ago has finally become reality			0
@entity8 triumphed over @entity20 by seven wickets at the recent @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 to win the right to play at the @entity11			1
they will be part of a group that includes co-hosts @entity124 and @entity126 , as well as @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
" i ca n't express my feelings			0
it is a very big day in my life			0
i 'm sure there will be huge celebrations back home , " the team 's talismanic captain , @entity134 , told the @entity71 website			0
" i did n't expect to play in a @entity11 when i started playing cricket			1
but now i can cherish this moment and look forward to playing against the best sides in some of the best playing facilities			0
