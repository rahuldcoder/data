-- @entity2 manager @entity1 has conceded the @entity5 club 's bid to win a first @entity7 title since 2004 is over following sunday 's 1 - 0 defeat at table - topping @entity9			1
a second - half goal from @entity12 midfielder @entity11 was enough to send @entity9 back above arch - rivals @entity13 at the summit , 12 points ahead of @entity2 in fifth position			1
" unfortunately for us it was a match that we could n't afford to lose because it puts us too much behind @entity9 , " the @entity17 told the @entity7 's official website			1
" if we had won the game we would have come back to six points , but at the moment we 're too far behind			2
it will be very difficult to close the gap now but we will try			0
" @entity2 had won seven of the last eight league games prior to defeat at the @entity29 , climbing back into contention for a top - four finish and a place in the @entity33			1
it followed a disastrous start to the season which saw the 13 - time @entity37 champions hammered 8 - 2 by @entity13 in addition to suffering defeats to @entity40 , @entity41 and north @entity5 rivals @entity42 in their first seven games			1
" this was a match we could n't afford to lose and that 's why it 's difficult to take , " @entity1 said			2
" on the other hand we will continue to fight and there are a lot of positives			0
" we have made a lot of progress since august and the team can be proud of that			2
the way we played is encouraging , but at the moment we need encouragement and points , and we only got encouragement			0
" @entity2 faced a defensive injury crisis ahead of sunday 's match as injuries to the @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 left @entity1 without a fit fullback			1
" i must say we have four fullbacks out and the first injury we get in the game is a fullback			0
it 's not only down to resources , you can not buy 17 fullbacks anyway			0
" that 's why i think we 've been a bit unlucky			0
but i think it was a match that could 've gone both ways			0
it was very intense with both teams going for it and i feel we were a bit unfortunate			0
" @entity2 will look to bounce back from sunday 's loss in wednesday 's trip to @entity87 , while @entity9 host @entity88 .			1
