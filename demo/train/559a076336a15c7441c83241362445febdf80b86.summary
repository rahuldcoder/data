debris flew into the stands , injuring a number of spectators -- at least two of them critically -- during a jaw - dropping crash saturday in the final turn of a @entity7 race at @entity8			1
the multicar crash occurred near the end of the @entity12 drive4copd 300 race at the same @entity14 track where sunday 's @entity15 will be held			1
the race had recently restarted after another wreck , after which driver @entity18 was hospitalized for bruising to his chest , according to @entity20			2
several closely - packed cars were jostling for position at top speed when they got tangled up , setting off a dangerous chain reaction that ensnared a number of vehicles			0
reigning @entity29 champ @entity28 -- who later told @entity30 he and others were simply " going for the win " -- was among those involved , while @entity34 somehow emerged unscathed and finished by winning the race			1
driver @entity37 's vehicle ended up flying into a fence that separates the track from spectators			0
it broke into pieces -- including tires and a fiery engine			1
@entity37 walked away from the crash , even after the front part of his no. 32 car was completely gone			2
he and the other nine drivers involved told reporters that they were checked at a medical tent on the @entity15 infield and released			0
some of the shredded debris flew into the barrier , while others got into the stands -- some of it reaching the second level about 20 feet up			1
a video posted on @entity60 shows a cloud of debris flying into stands and one man gasping , " oh , my @entity65			1
" a tire rests on one seat , as a man frantically waves and yells to get the attention of paramedics			2

' " accidents are nothing new to @entity7 , where cars often cruise at speeds topping 190 mph , nor to the @entity15 track			0
