-- in a world where information is plentiful and abundant , traders are always trying to make money by finding that hidden advantage			2
many are betting that 140 characters is all it takes to beat the market			0
some professionals in the world of high finance are relying on @entity13 and other social media to try to get the edge on the competition			1
markets went into a spin last year when someone hacked the @entity21 's @entity13 account and sent bogus tweets about an explosion at the @entity24 , showing just how powerful a sentence can be when millions of dollars are put behind it			1
@entity13 has transformed communication across a host of industries , but many industries remain straightforward in how they use it			1
especially in the world of commodities			2
in @entity35 , traders trade futures contracts in every kind of product , from corn to pork belly to orange juice concentrate futures			2
essentially , they are making bets on the demand and supply of these items at a later date			0
every extra speck of information can make the difference			0
some traders expressly follow farmers across the @entity52 and try to get a sense of how much soybean or maize is coming in this year 's crop			1
others actively engage with the people that make the products they trade , looking for that edge , directly tweeting farmers for information on what weather they are having and what crops they are growing			2
but others are using @entity13 to in more innovative ways to stay ahead of the pack			1
" our systems can analyze and determine a tweet in less than a second from the moment a person tweets , " says @entity68 , the founder of the investment management firm @entity69			0
" analyzing untapped and unstructured data sets such as @entity13 gives us a distinct advantage over other investment managers			1
" @entity68 has been working on a fund based exclusively on using sentiment analysis of @entity13 for years , analyzing tweets for relevance and for positive and negative sentiment to base its trades on			1
his first fund was in july 2010 , when the @entity86 debt stand - off caused huge turmoil in the financial markets and forced the $ 25 million fund to close after just a month			0
@entity68 is launching his second try at such a fund later this year			0
" we 're in the process of raising Â £ 5 million ( $ 8.3 million ) for the new fund and we 've secured Â £ 1.5 million so far , " he says			0
if his first fund had taken off , @entity96 's simulated real - time account showed that it would have returned 23.8 % last year -- impressive , but not as good as the @entity97 , which returned 26.5 % over the same period			0
for @entity68 , the benefits of going @entity13 - only are obvious			1
" breaking news , information trends and global events hit the @entity13 network before anywhere else , " he says			1
@entity13 appears to be a special case			2
they have tried to feed in data from @entity106 and @entity107 , the url shortener , but to no avail			0
" when people tweet they tend to be talking about real - world events as opposed to @entity106 which is more personal and relevant only to friends and family			0
" others are trying to turn the world of trading into the new @entity13			1
@entity117 founded @entity118 in 2007 as a social network for investing and sees it as democratizing the space			1
" it 's about opening the global market and investing and trading in a transparent way , " he says			2
" when you 're using @entity106 or @entity13 , it 's about social signals			1
so not all your friends are ones whose financial investments you really want to copy			0
" his network allows anyone to trade both virtual and real money , connect with one other and compare investment bets -- and copy the trading strategies of others			1
@entity118 , which is not yet available in the @entity86 because of regulatory hurdles , has 3.5 million registered users , of which most are using virtual money			1
about 300,000 are trading with their own cash on the site			0
it 's @entity106 - meets - fantasy football for wannabe day traders			0
@entity117 thinks we 're at the start of a change in how we invest , one that will transform trading decisions to ones not just based off reactions to real - world events or mathematical modelling , but one based on the analysis of social media as well			1
" i think in the future you 'll have not just fundamental and technical analysis , but social analysis , " he says			2
@entity68 , the founder of the @entity166 - based hedge fund , concurs			2
" we 're in the middle of a data explosion , " he says			0
" trend - following has been a successful trading strategy for over a century and that forms the core of our investment process			0
what makes us different from any other trend - following hedge fund is the data we use			0
" with billions to be made , @entity13 and social media may end up being one of the democratizing forces in the world of finance			1
