-- one thing fans of the tv series " @entity4 " -- sometimes called " marshmallows " -- hope to see in the movie " @entity4 " is a resolution to the ongoing debate : @entity8 or @entity9 ? when last we left the young detective , it seemed @entity4 had finally settled down with @entity13 -- something that still seems to be the case in the trailer for the movie , which was funded entirely by legions of devoted fans			1
" i know people were pissed off the way it did end , mostly because it was unknown , " @entity19 ( @entity8 ) told @entity0 thursday at the @entity21 event for " @entity4 , " out this weekend			1
" we give it some resolution in the film , but playing it back and forth is what makes the drama in the show			1
" @entity8 was never supposed to be coupled with @entity4 originally , show creator @entity33 revealed at the @entity21 panel			1
but he grew on the writers when they saw @entity19 's chemistry with star @entity37			0
that chemistry came back right away when he did his first scene with @entity37 on set , @entity19 told @entity0			0
" i think @entity37 is amazing , and when she smiles at me i kind of go , ' holy s --- what do i do ? ' i smile back , and it just comes right back			0
" meanwhile , @entity44 offered " @entity9 " fans this hint about his character 's chances of being the one to end up with @entity4			1
" i think @entity33 likes to not put a period on the end of every sentence when he finishes something , " he said			0
" the show ended on a cliffhanger note			1
i believe in a way he did a similar thing here			0
" @entity33 said the resolution might still be debated in fan circles even after they see the movie			2
" i think that fans will understand why @entity4 makes the decisions she makes , " he said			1
" it 's a fun predicament to put @entity4 in -- will she go with her good sense or her passions ? " one thing @entity33 did make clear is that he made the final call on how things ended up			1
five ways the show made its mark on tv " it was not up for a vote			2
certainly i had a way i wanted it to go and that 's how it went , but we 'll let the fans decide if they 're happy with how it ended up			0
" of course , none of this would have been possible without the crowdfunding from @entity86 , which gave the movie its budget of well over $ 5 million			2
" it 's been a roller coaster ride for me in terms of hope , " he said			0
" there were moments where i felt optimistic and bullish about our chances , and others where i felt so low , i thought it would n't happen			0
@entity37 has this confidence and optimism that kept it going			0
it was like a mini-miracle when it came together			0
" @entity33 thinks this could potentially be something we see more and more , especially when it comes to @entity108 , the studio that owns " @entity4 " and gave @entity33 the opportunity to try crowdfunding			1
( @entity108 is owned by @entity111 , which also owns @entity0			0
) " the next few weeks will tell			0
if the movie makes money then i think there 's an opportunity for more movies like ours to be made , " he said			2
" if we find this model that can support $ 5 or $ 10 million , i think [ @entity108 ] would be thrilled , and i 'd be proud if we got more $ 5 to 10 million movies [ based on existing series or properties ] because of this			2
" so might we get more " @entity4 " after this ? there 's already a @entity128 web series based on @entity130 's character @entity131 set to shoot in july			1
@entity33 told the fans at @entity21 that the idea of a @entity135 or @entity136 season of " @entity4 " excites him to no end			1
" i would love to be able to do the r - rated version of ' @entity4			1
' i would love to tell some darker stories			2
" in the meantime , fans can hope that @entity33 ' tv adaptation of the comic book " @entity147 " starring @entity144 ( " @entity145 , " " @entity146 " ) gets picked up by the @entity128			0
" they said they wanted a kick - ass female centric show like ' @entity150 ' and ' @entity4 , ' and i think it 's a fun show in that vein , " he told @entity0			1
" i think we jump off the comic book [ storylines ] quite a bit , but we keep the basic idea that our young female zombies have to eat brains to survive , and she gets the memories of the people whose brains she 's consuming			0
" well , we can see one big difference right away			0
so not just " @entity4 " fans but clearly , " @entity169 " fans might want to check it out , as well			1
