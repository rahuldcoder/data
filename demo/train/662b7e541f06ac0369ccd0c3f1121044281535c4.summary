-- when the draw for the third round of the @entity4 was made , one match particularly enticed -- @entity5 versus @entity6			1
with @entity5 leading the @entity7 and @entity6 rejuvenated under new manager @entity8 , the encounter between the north @entity11 rivals indeed promised much			1
but in the end it was mostly one - way traffic and the @entity14 prevailed 2 - 0 at home to advance in football 's oldest knockout competition			1
the @entity4 is famous for its giant killings although on saturday only one @entity7 team lost to lower - division opposition , @entity21			1
and even then , @entity21 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity23 was n't that big of a surprise since @entity21 boss @entity25 said this week the @entity4 was a distraction			1
@entity27 will still be favored to beat @entity28 in a replay following their 1 - 1 draw but the quadruple chasers are facing a stack of fixtures in january			1
@entity5 , which trails only @entity34 in @entity4 successes , took an early lead when in - form @entity38 midfielder @entity37 sent a left - footed shot into the top corner in the 31st minute			1
@entity5 maintained the pressure in the second half and doubled the advantage when @entity6 fullback @entity45 was dispossessed by @entity46 near the halfway line			1
@entity46 coolly beat @entity48 in the 62nd minute to preserve manager @entity50 's streak of never losing in the third round			0
" we won such an important game -- it means a lot to us and the fans , obviously , " @entity46 told @entity55			0
the lone bad news for @entity5 was a leg injury to @entity59 , another player in form			2
@entity59 left the pitch in controversial fashion , telling @entity6 fans -- with his hands -- what the score was			2
@entity50 said he was told it was the @entity69 international 's reaction to being hit with coins			0
" what he did was not offensive , " @entity50 told reporters			0
" i do n't think the @entity4 will take any action			0
i have seen the pictures and he is not being aggressive			0
" @entity6 was unable to build on its 2 - 1 win at @entity34 in the league on wednesday and was eliminated from a @entity4 competition for the second time in about two weeks			1
with @entity8 at the helm , then as a caretaker , @entity6 lost to @entity83 at @entity84 in the @entity86 quarterfinals			0
@entity21 ousted despite saying that most @entity7 managers would prefer to avoid the @entity4 , @entity25 fielded star striker @entity88 against third - tier struggler @entity23			1
but it was @entity91 who got a late winner at @entity94 -- and now @entity25 can focus fully on keeping his team in the top division			0
" there was never any way i was decrying the competition at all , " a defiant @entity25 told @entity21 's website			2
" you want to try and do a good run			0
if you look at the @entity86 last time , we picked strong teams throughout the competition			0
i never take them lightly			0
" @entity27 , embarrassed by @entity108 in last year 's final , took a 1 - 0 lead at second - tier @entity28 though conceded the equalizer in the 55th minute			1
" i think it 's very important to still be in the cup -- we played against a strong home team , " city manager @entity112 told the club website			0
@entity27 , which finished with 10 men after the 85th - minute dismissal of @entity120 , could play seven more games in january , a test even for its deep squad			2
@entity108 , now in the @entity124 , will replay against the @entity125 after a 3 - 3 draw			2
in the all @entity7 ties , @entity127 began his reign as @entity132 boss with a 2 - 1 upset win at @entity134 ; @entity135 and @entity136 drew 1 - 1 ; and @entity137 won 2 - 0 at @entity138			1
@entity139 , the lowest - ranked team in the third round , earned a replay by drawing @entity143 wednesday 1 - 1			2
among sunday 's matches , @entity144 hosts @entity146 and @entity34 entertains @entity147 .			0

@entity5 defeats @entity6 2 - 0 to advance to the fourth round of the @entity4
@entity5 is the second most successful side in the competition behind @entity34
@entity21 was the only @entity7 team to lose to lower - division opposition
