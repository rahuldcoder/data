in may , @entity0 became the first of the new generation of commercial aerospace companies to deliver cargo to the @entity5			1
the cargo delivery was part of the first flight test of the integrated falcon - 9 launch vehicle and the dragon capsule spacecraft with rendezvous and berthing mechanism systems			0
by all accounts , the major test objectives were successfully achieved			0
previously , such spacecraft and operations had only been achieved by governments			0
what made this a historic first was that a commercial company had done it			0
the news was widely covered in the international media , especially in the @entity24			0
one month later , @entity25 launched its fourth crewed space mission , @entity27 - 9			1
this was also a history - making flight , in that @entity25 , which had in 2003 become only the third nation capable of launching astronauts into space ( and is now only one of two , since the retirement of the @entity24 space shuttle in 2011 ) , demonstrated crewed rendezvous and docking to their orbital module , @entity40 - 1			1
the crew also featured @entity25 's first female astronaut			1
they spent several days docked to @entity44 conducting various operations , before safely returning to @entity46 on thursday night			0
@entity25 's mission was widely covered in the international media , but the coverage in the @entity24 was notably quieter than that of @entity0			1
this is somewhat understandable , as @entity0 is an @entity24 company			1
but the sentiment of many in the @entity24 is that the @entity25 mission was a big " so what ? " after all , the @entity24 and @entity55 governments had demonstrated crewed docking missions back in the 1960s , and operationally , @entity25 is still far behind			1
the difference in @entity24 attitudes toward these two accomplishments is striking			2
this is especially interesting given the relative positions of the two			0
@entity0 is off to an impressive start , but it will be several years from now before they ( and / or other commercial players ) could have an operational , crewed orbital spacecraft			2
@entity25 , on the other hand , has a relatively mature human spaceflight program that is nearly a decade old			2
we downplay @entity25 's accomplishments at our own peril			1
that the @entity24 and the @entity55 demonstrated crewed rendezvous and docking operations more than 40 years ago is not the point			2
the point is , now the @entity25 can do it , too			2
@entity25 's first crewed space docking was a giant step			1
it enables the @entity25 to build and operate their own space station , establish the technology that is necessary to efficiently send astronauts to the moon and beyond , build and operate fuel depots , and construct vehicles and bases in space			1
opinion : will @entity25 overtake @entity24 in space ? the commercial efforts to low @entity46 orbit , which @entity0 achieved , are only a piece of the @entity24 space program			1
the other much larger piece is exploration of deeper space			0
this is the domain of government space agencies			0
in this , the @entity24 must not scale back			0
i have seen @entity25 's space technology			1
what the @entity25 lack is operational experience			2
in that , we are still far ahead			0
but we in the know hear footsteps			0
it 's time not for another government space race , but for expanded space cooperation and collaboration -- an effort the @entity24 would lead , as it does today with the @entity5 program			1
bring @entity25 into the international fold			2
this is how we can retain the leadership position			0
otherwise , we risk falling behind .			0

@entity118 : @entity25 's first manned space docking in june was a giant step for the country
@entity118 : we *celebrated* @entity0 's mission , but were notably quieter about @entity25 's mission
he says : we downplay @entity25 's accomplishments at our own peril
@entity118 : we do *n't* need another space race , but we must not lose our leadership in space
