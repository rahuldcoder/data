-- i had hopes that with the talent of the two leads and the good buzz on director @entity7 's previous film , " @entity6 , " " @entity8 " would be more than it eventually ended up being , which is an occasionally funny , more often stupid , diversion			1
it 's a decent way to spend 90 minutes if you have nothing else to do , but it does n't exactly scream " see me in the theater ! " the story is simple enough			2
@entity17 's @entity16 delivers pizzas for a living , committing every moving violation in the book to get the pies to their destination on time , even when the location is clearly miles away			1
if he does n't , it comes out of his pay , and one has to imagine that his pay is n't very high			0
@entity16 is a prototypical movie version of the genial slacker			1
he 's got a dead - end job , not much in the brains department and seemingly no ambition ( and even less of a moral compass ) , yet he manages to be charming enough to have slept with his best friend 's gorgeous twin sister ( a potential for gags that 's barely touched ) who is actually going somewhere			0
meanwhile , his far - more responsible ( but equally feckless ) best friend @entity40 ( @entity40 , reduced here to a shrieking parody of a human ) is a teacher at the local school and has just about as limited a future as @entity16 , not to mention an equally poor decision - making capacity			1
at the same time , two complete morons ( @entity49 as @entity50 and @entity51 as @entity52 ) hatch a complicated ( and thoroughly inane ) plan to kill @entity50 's @entity55 vet father , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) to inherit what 's left of a $ 10 million lottery win			0
this " plan " involves committing several smaller crimes , including strapping a bomb to @entity16 's chest to force him to rob a bank so @entity64 and @entity65 can get enough money to pay a hit man			1
see where this is going ? @entity69 , often hysterical in @entity71 's " @entity70 , " has become typecast and desperately needs to break out of this character			0
his variations on a theme of a crude , not - so - bright bull in a @entity79 shop is getting stale -- the effect of which in this film is the constant urge to reach through the screen and punch him in the mouth			2
it did n't occur to me to do the math , but there may have been more crimes committed per minute in this film than in any since 1980 's " @entity92 , " and some of them are indeed funny			1
i 'm not sure if that 's a good thing , but go with it			2
mostly , however , they 're just stupid , not to mention poorly paced and frantically acted			0
what it boils down to is , " @entity8 " is loaded with stupid characters , crude jokes ( some funny , some not so much ) , one pretty good car chase , some very good actors in wasted , underwritten roles and a massive requirement of its audience to suspend disbelief			1
do n't get me wrong			0
i love stupid humor , if it 's stupid like a fox ( get it ? )			2
i also do n't have anything against mindless comedies , as long as they 're funny			0
the thing is , if they 're really funny , they 're not really mindless			0
basically , " @entity8 " is n't truly bad enough to be bad , but it 's not really very good , either .			1

@entity17 's @entity16 delivers pizzas for a living in " @entity8 "
more crimes likely committed per minute in this film than in any since " @entity92
the movie is loaded with stupid characters , crude jokes and one pretty good car chase
