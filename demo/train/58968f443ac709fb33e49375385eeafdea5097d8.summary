in spite of a successful rocket launch on saturday , things did n't quite work out as @entity4 had hoped , when it tried to make history with an experiment			1
the @entity8 rocket lifted off as scheduled at 4:47 a.m. et from @entity9 , @entity10 , on a routine mission to resupply the @entity12			1
what went up is doing fine			2
what came down did n't quite , but the the rocket scientists were almost counting on that , and they 're not too disappointed			2
the company tried to land the first section of the rocket , which is 14 stories tall , back down gingerly and on its feet on @entity22 , while the rest of the rocket continued on			1
a floating landing pad was waiting out in the @entity26 for the booster			1
it made it there , but came down a little too hard , @entity4 founder @entity28 said in a tweet			2
" @entity33 made it to drone spaceport ship , but landed hard			2
close , but no cigar this time			2
" do n't lose it ; reuse it normally , once it has vaulted the rest of the rocket to space , the huge booster falls back into the ocean as , basically , garbage			1
that has been compared to throwing away a @entity47 passenger jet after it makes one transatlantic flight			1
but @entity4 has been determined to change the practice to save millions in costs			0
instead of losing the biggest part of the rocket , the company aims to reuse it			0
the @entity8 is made up of two sections , called stages , that contain engines			0
on top of the rocket is the capsule , which carries its payload			1
it could also carry astronauts some day			0
after the launch -- then the separation from the second stage of the rocket -- the @entity8 rocket 's booster turned around to head back down to the floating platform			1
the company logo 's signature " x " marked the spot in the middle of a bull 's eye on the black tarmac of the " spaceport drone ship " that plowed through the water autonomously -- with no need of human drivers , who could get hurt in a bang - up			0
some stuff on the ship did get dinged when the rocket plunked down on it , @entity28 said in a tweet			0
second try the originally planned launch on tuesday was scrubbed due to technical issues that turned up in the rocket 's second stage			1
scratching a launch time is routine for the space industry -- sometimes due to weather , sometimes for technical reasons			1
as @entity28 said when a different model rocket self - detonated as a safety measure during a soft - landing test in august : " @entity33 are tricky			1
" the official mission though the landing was a test , the launch was not			1
the " @entity102 " capsule is carrying a payload of up to about 5,000 pounds to the @entity12 with five previous trips , the resupply missions have become somewhat routine			1
and this one appeared to be going as planned on saturday			0
@entity102 will land back on @entity22 the usual way in four and a half weeks , plopping into ocean water , after blazing back through the atmosphere with red - hot heat shields glowing at up to 3,000 degrees @entity111			1
the historic part @entity4 has tried the landing experiment before , with the exception of the last step			2
if the @entity8 's booster had pulled off the landing on the platform , that would have been historic			1
in previous experiments , engineers brought it down softly into the water			0
here 's how the booster was designed to get back down to @entity22			2
first , fall at a speed of about a mile a minute			0
then fire boosters three times in sequence , which @entity4 describes in colorful terms			0
the first boost , called the " boostback burn " turns the bottom of the first stage downward , then the " supersonic retro propulsion burn " cuts the fall speed to about 800 feet per second			0
then comes the " landing burn , " when the landing gear legs also push out for the set - down			2
by then the booster descends at a speed of about seven feet per second			2
@entity8 9 boosters have gone through these phases successfully in two prior tests , @entity4 said			0
at the end , the rockets tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean , causing damage that made them unusable			0
but that was according to plan , @entity4 said			0
setting down with its landing legs onto the platform would have preserved the booster for its possible reuse			1
though it did n't work out , @entity4 did n't necessarily expect it to			0
it had puts the odds of success of this first try at 50 % -- at best			0

soft landing of booster fails , but launch and rest of flight successful
the " @entity102 " capsule is heading with supplies to the @entity12
