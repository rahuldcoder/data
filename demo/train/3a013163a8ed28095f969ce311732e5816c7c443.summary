-- he 's made more money at the movies this year than @entity4 , @entity5 , invading aliens and yes , even @entity7			2
his name is @entity9 , a strange - looking lizard with the voice of @entity12 , and he 's the current king of the box office			1
in 2009 , only one fully animated film , " up , " was among the 10 biggest domestic grossers of the year			1
in 2010 , the box office crown was taken by " @entity17 , " and it was among five films in the top 10			1
in both years , animated films grossed well over $ 1 billion			1
" @entity9 " is n't alone at the box office this year , either			1
live - action / animation hybrid " @entity31 " has been the no. 1 movie for two weekends running , while the last weekend in february saw @entity25 's computer - animated romantic comedy " @entity26 " holding its own in its third week in theaters , just barely coming in second to that weekend 's new comedy " @entity30			1
" " @entity35 " is approaching a total take of $ 100 million in the @entity34			1
this weekend sees the release of the animated musical " @entity37 , " which has already made more than $ 50 million internationally			1
the sequel " hoodwinked too ! @entity39 " is out later this month			0
animation as a box office force ( despite a few exceptions ) could n't come about only because of families with young kids			1
rabid fans of the genre often follow every release and enjoy the artistic aspect of it as well as the fact that so many of the films work on a completely different level for adults			1
" the output of animated features in the last few years has definitely opened up from when i was a kid 20 years ago , " said @entity54 , a writer for @entity55 , who has a degree in animation from @entity58			1
" there is a variety to the marketplace these days that can allow us to pick and choose from the pop - culture oriented fare from @entity67 or allow us to seek out the unfamiliar like @entity69 's ' @entity68			1
' " @entity71 resident @entity54 has been inspired since childhood by the medium : " with animation , there is the potential to take us to new worlds or environments that seem somehow familiar , but have been tweaked in little ways			0
you can see this in the style of the very angular world of the film ' @entity86 , ' and even the vehicle - themed environments in the world of ' cars			0
' " twenty years ago , hand - drawn animation experienced a resurgence in popularity thanks to " @entity93 , " " @entity94 , " and later , " @entity95			2
" when the first " @entity97 " was released in 1995 , it heralded the eventual takeover by computer animation in feature films			2
still , @entity25 was practically the only game in town			1
@entity104 resident @entity103 is one of many hardcore fans of @entity25 's @entity107 animation studio , which has won the @entity108 the past four years			1
" the way they combine the art of storytelling with the technology they use is incredible , " said @entity103 , who created the fan site @entity110 in 2007 and was flown out to visit the studio last year			1
" they really put a lot of attention into their story , more than any film studio out there , be it animated or live action			1
the story is what makes the movies work			0
" " @entity107 is really the only bulletproof brand left in @entity130 , " said @entity128 editor @entity127			0
" they have n't had a flop yet			0
" @entity133 , editor and publisher of @entity135 , said a big reason for that is the broad appeal of the studio 's recent releases			1
" you hear adults talking about how they were moved by ' @entity17 , ' and ' @entity143 ' was a great story about an older character			0
when they fire on all cylinders like that , the ( box office ) can really take off			1
" in 2001 , the game changed again , when @entity67 found success with " @entity151 , " the first of four movies in that franchise ( with the spinoff , " @entity156 , " due later this year )			1
" we 've been very excited to see the growth and popularity of animation , " said @entity157 , head of worldwide marketing for @entity159			0
in recent years , the studio 's hits have included the first two " @entity86 " movies ( a third is on the way in june 2012 ) and " @entity169 , " whose sequel , following the adventures of @entity174 's character , @entity173 , will be released on may 26			1
@entity175 pointed out that " @entity169 's " official @entity177 page has had great success , with more than 3 million " likes " from users			0
" certainly that is attributable to the popularity of the character , " she said			0
" @entity173 and @entity151 are both very popular on @entity177			0
" in 2002 , the first of many " @entity187 " movies became a blockbuster for @entity190 's @entity189 ( a fourth film is due next year ) , and the company hopes to see similar success with " @entity37 , " especially with teens and beyond			2
the movie 's partnership with the popular " @entity197 " online game has been a huge success , and a performance by two of the movie 's stars , @entity201 and @entity204 , on " @entity205 " attempted to attract that show 's audience via the soundtrack			0
" animated movies have become very unique in that in the last several years , they have become all - audience movies , " said @entity209 , executive vice president of marketing for @entity190			1
through marketing campaigns like the one for " @entity37 , " he said , " we are able to speak to the widest audience possible and can speak to different audience segments			0
adults also know that there are jokes in the movie for them , that there 's an emotional story for them			0
" it 's hard to find a studio that has n't jumped into the animation game			0
" almost all of the studios have really broken through : @entity230 did well with ' @entity231 , ' and @entity190 has done well with ' @entity187 , ' " said @entity133			2
" it 's no longer just a @entity25 brand			2
" @entity234 is the latest studio fairly new to the animation world to have a smash hit on its hands with " @entity9			0
" " when you look at these animated movies like ' @entity241 , ' it was cute but it also had raw humor for adults			2
it was hip , " said @entity133			0
" you see the same thing with ' @entity9 ' now			0
these are much bigger than a ' kiddie ' movie			0
" @entity67 also strives to put out movies that will have broad appeal			1
" it makes for a great audience response to our films , " said @entity175			2
" in addition to the family audience , we 've had great success with teens and tweens , and we hope to see the same reaction to ' @entity264			0
' " animation is a fact of life in @entity130 beyond " @entity151 " and " @entity97			0
" " ( computer - generated imagery ) , which is used more and more in normal live action films , is now the bread and butter of the animation world , " said ireporter @entity268 , a film critic for the past 10 years and former entertainment reporter at @entity272 's @entity271			1
" in fact , @entity278 has advanced so much it is hard to tell the difference between animation and reality these days			0
" there seems to be no limit to the amount of animated fare we 'll see coming out of @entity130 in the near future			2
" with three major sequels , a prequel and a handful of other nicely timed releases , 2011 animation has the potential for similar growth " to last year , said @entity268 , who gave his most glowing review of the year so far to " @entity9			2
" aside from " @entity156 , " other highly anticipated films this year include " @entity299 , " " @entity300 , " " @entity301 : @entity302 , " and the hand - drawn " @entity303			2
" @entity67 recently announced several upcoming animated features , including " @entity305 , " and a new version of " mr. @entity307 , " for 2012 and beyond			1
for the " @entity311 " franchise , a second movie is just the beginning			0
" we were thrilled with the response for the first film , and subsequently fans are interested in what the sequel will be , " said @entity175			2
" also , @entity319 will be bringing forth a tv series in 2012			0
" ( @entity319 , like @entity0 is a @entity321 company			0
) as long as the big box office numbers keep rolling in , moviegoers will continue to see more			1
as @entity127 put it , " when the movie is well - made and the marketing is done well , the rewards are enormous			0

animated films have *dominated* the box office more and more in recent years
many studios are getting in on the action , beyond @entity25 and @entity67
fans *admire* the artistry and clever storytelling of these films
