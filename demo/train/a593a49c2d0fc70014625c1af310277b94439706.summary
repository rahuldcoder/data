-- for years , @entity1 has been feted as the strong man of @entity3 : while those around it battled years of boom - and - bust , @entity1 , stable and consistent , thrived			2
its economy -- and the economic management of its leaders -- was frequently cited as an example to the rest of the world			0
but in recent years , that very stability has come to threaten the country , by forcing it to take a leading role in the bailouts of its less economically healthy neighbors , pledging to protect them from sinking under the weight of their debts			1
despite being seen as vital for the survival of the euro , @entity1 's actions have been greeted with anger and frustration at home			2
a @entity33 / @entity32 poll published on tuesday found that just 15 % of @entity34 questioned approved of their government 's performance during the euro crisis , while 75 % disapproved			1
concern about what the bailouts will mean for the eurozone has proved contagious , tarnishing not just the economies , but the individuals involved -- and @entity34 chancellor @entity44 is no exception			1
@entity44 and @entity47 huddle as euro struggles frequently dubbed @entity1 's " @entity54 " and hailed as the country 's answer to former @entity53 prime minister @entity52 , the euro crisis has now left @entity44 's image looking decidedly rusty			1
@entity44 , 57 , the daughter of a @entity57 minister , was brought up in then - communist @entity1			2
she trained as a chemist before turning to politics as a member of the conservative , right - wing @entity62 ( @entity63 )			0
she was elected as chancellor -- the first woman to hold the post -- in 2005 , 15 years after she entered parliament			0
she was re-elected in 2009 , but recent polls suggest she may struggle to secure a third term			1
a survey by @entity34 television channel @entity70 earlier this month recorded a drop in @entity44 's approval ratings -- just 45 % of those polled said they were satisfied with her work , a slide of four points compared with the previous month			1
the same poll appeared to predict a grim future for @entity44 's @entity63 / @entity80 , with support for the party slipping to 36 % , compared to the 51 % who backed likely coalition partners , the @entity84 and the @entity85			1
and there was further bad news for @entity44 , with her coalition partners , the @entity88 ( @entity89 ) , notching up just 4 % support in the survey -- a result that , were it to be repeated in real elections , would see them fall below the minimum vote threshold , and lose their place in parliament			0
the @entity89 has already threatened to withdraw their support for the coalition if @entity44 and the @entity63 back controversial euro bonds as a potential solution to the @entity3 debt crisis -- a move that could bring down the government			2
in march this year , the @entity63 lost control of the prosperous southern state of @entity107 , which it had governed ever since the 1950s			0
and with more elections to come later this year , in @entity111 and the northern state of @entity113 , many @entity63 members fear the euro crisis could yet do further damage to the party -- and its embattled leader			0
as @entity1 's conservative @entity122 newspaper recently pointed out in an editorial , " it is possible the next election may even hinge on this issue			2
" " for @entity44 , it is both a curse and a blessing			0
like her one - time mentor @entity128 , it would provide her the chance to go down in history as a great @entity3			0
at the same time , she runs the risk of what happened to her predecessor , @entity133			0
[ who ] did the right thing economically -- but was then voted out of office			0
" the latest financial figures mean @entity44 and her party can no longer rely on the strength of the economy to see them through			0
on tuesday , @entity1 announced its gdp for the second quarter of 2011 had virtually flatlined , growing by just 0.1 % ( compared to 1.3 % growth in the first quarter of the year )			1
@entity34 slowdown adds to eurozone crisis there may be trouble ahead for @entity44 , and for @entity1 as a whole , but the country 's years of stability should allow it to weather the storm more easily than some of its neighbors			1
and while the euro crisis has dented the chancellor 's image , the @entity33 / @entity32 poll suggests that most @entity34 hostility over the situation is directed towards @entity163			1
of those @entity34 questioned in the survey , 59 % were firmly opposed to further bailouts ( with just 20 % supporting them ) , and 58 % backed the idea of booting @entity163 out of the eurozone .			2

@entity170 crisis has hit @entity34 chancellor @entity44 's *popularity* ratings
recent polls suggest she may struggle to secure third term .
@entity1 has played lead role in bailouts of economically weaker neighbors
but this week @entity1 announced weak economic growth
