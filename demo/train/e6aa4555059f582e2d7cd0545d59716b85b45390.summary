call it a historic technological achievement			0
call it a victory lap across @entity4			2
call it a shameless promotion for a controversial energy agenda			0
its owners simply call it @entity11			2
it 's the first manned plane to fly for 24 hours on nothing but solar - powered batteries			1
that 's right -- we 're talking about a sun - powered plane that can fly at night			1
" theoretically , " said its pilot , @entity19 , " the plane can fly forever			1
" the @entity22 - made @entity11 is in the middle of a @entity4 tour this month , flying five legs from @entity26 to @entity27			1
in 2015 , @entity19 and his co-pilot , @entity28 , hope to make the next generation of @entity11 the first solar - powered plane to circle the globe			1
it 's a lofty goal for this funny - looking , slow and unwieldy design -- with one main wheel , a tiny cockpit and no toilet			0
it 's made of revolutionary lightweight materials and its solar cells are built in as part of the wings			0
basically , it 's a giant flying solar cell			0
circling the globe is only part of the plan			0
the mission also includes an environmental agenda aimed at promoting the use of green technology and renewable energy sources such as the sun and the wind			1
we caught up with @entity19 on the phone at @entity55 , where he landed after flying the first 18 - hour , 650 - mile leg of @entity11 's journey from @entity58 , @entity26			1
as a safety precaution , @entity19 reportedly had to circle the airport to wait for officials to suspend commercial flight operations for his landing			2
turbulence poses the biggest danger when piloting @entity11 , @entity19 said			1
while flying near @entity67 's @entity66 , he said , he experienced some of the worst turbulence since he started flying the aircraft in @entity71 several years ago			0
related video : watch @entity11 in motion even with the aircraft 's lumbering 43 - mph cruising speed , @entity19 " was really fighting hard to keep the plane on track , " he said			1
flying through clouds and near mountains , he said , offers the biggest potential for turbulence			0
he keeps a parachute handy for a worst - case scenario , which he said is unlikely			0
the men at age 54 , @entity19 is a bona fide adventurer -- with world records to prove it			1
decades after pioneering ultralight aircraft in the 1970s , @entity19 and his colleague @entity89 were the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999			1
their gondola is displayed at the @entity96			0
breaking barriers is a @entity19 family tradition			2
his grandfather explored the stratosphere in a pressurized chamber carried by a balloon			0
ten miles high , he was the first human to see the curvature of the planet with his own eyes			0
@entity19 's father plumbed the @entity107 , taking a special submarine to a record - setting depth of nearly 7 miles			1
" i was deeply influenced by them , " he said			0
" @entity111 of my adventures is a way to pay tribute to everything they 've showed me and taught me and initiated me to do			0
" oh , and on a random note , @entity19 is a respected psychiatrist with a recognized expertise in hypnosis			2
@entity28 , 60 , came to the project with more than two decades as a @entity22 @entity122 fighter pilot			0
it was @entity28 who was in the cockpit during the @entity11 's 24 - hour flight			1
the machine this beautiful example of elegant engineering looks like a giant goose			0
its wings are huge : 208 feet -- that 's wider than a @entity133			0
a 747 's maximum takeoff weight is 833,000 pounds			0
this plane weighs only 3,500 pounds -- about the same as a @entity136 its batteries are able to store enough energy from the sun during the day to power the aircraft throughout the night			1
and what happens in the cockpit when nature calls ? @entity19 , always the gentleman , explained it like this : when the plane takes off , " you have full bottles of water on the right side and empty bottles on the left side , " he said			1
" and when you land , it 's the other way around			0
" in 2012 , @entity11 flew from @entity155 to @entity156 , making it the first manned sun - powered plane to fly to another continent			1
but it wo n't be the first solar aircraft to soar the entire width of the @entity4			1
the @entity163 , piloted by @entity164 , crossed the nation in 21 legs back in 1990			0
four years earlier , @entity167 and @entity168 flew a fossil fuel - powered plane , the @entity171 , around the world nonstop without refueling			2
but it 's never been done with a solar - powered aircraft -- so far			1
the mission the @entity11 's goals amount to more than breaking records and making history			2
the group hopes to change minds and influence future generations			0
with each stop on their itinerary , @entity19 and @entity28 bring with them a message : use technology that saves energy and support government - mandated targets for creating electricity from renewable sources			1
many @entity4 states have passed legislation calling on utilities to generate specific percentages of their electricity from renewables -- wind , water , solar or others -- by a certain date			1
supporters say such regulations will cut pollution caused by burning fossil fuels			0
opponents say it will drive energy prices higher			0
the @entity213 administration has opened millions of acres of public land to be used by private companies for giant solar power farms			2
what does the future of solar - powered transportation look like ? as more consumers buy electric - powered cars , more vehicle charging stations are popping up which are powered by the sun. but a commercially viable solar - powered car , experts say , is still very far down the road			2
and many engineers say the development of a solar - powered airliner is very unlikely because they do n't believe it 's possible to build an onboard system that can produce the massive amounts of energy required			1
a few tinkerers are coming up with solar - powered scooters and pedal vehicles , like the @entity237 being sold in @entity238			2
development of @entity11 may contribute to better designs of " long - endurance unmanned aerial vehicles , " as the @entity243 calls them			1
engineers are developing giant solar - powered flying wings that are remote - controlled and designed to remain aloft at high altitudes for weeks , months , or even years -- nonstop			2
such machines could be used for scientific research or surveillance , or as relay stations to transmit communication signals across long distances			0
@entity19 and @entity28 are looking forward to a future that includes more solar power			1
in the meantime , they 'll be focusing on their plan to circle the globe and their current journey across @entity4			1
that will include a stop in @entity262 , the hometown of aviation icon @entity264			0
" i think we share the same spirit , " @entity19 said of @entity264 , the first pilot to solo across the @entity267			2
global excitement from that 1927 flight sparked the beginning of a " new cycle , " @entity19 said , which led to the international airline industry we enjoy today			0
@entity19 hopes @entity11 will start a similar cycle that will lead to unimaginable new dimensions in the development of technology .			1

@entity11 is the first manned plane to fly 24 hours on sun power
*groundbreaking* aircraft is now on a five - leg trip across the @entity4
adventurer @entity19 wants to pilot a solar plane around the globe
@entity11 promotes renewable energy sources and energy - *efficient* technology
