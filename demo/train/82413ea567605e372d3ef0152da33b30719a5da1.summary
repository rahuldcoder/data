" this series was one of the very first family - based reality programs on television			2
special thanks to @entity29 for over a decade of great producing			2
the @entity3 have given us really innovative bike builds and real drama since 2002			1
we wish both @entity34 and @entity35 designs the best			2
" the series had a simple format â € ” a father and son building custom motorcycles amid frequent infighting			0
yet nothing about the show 's colorful history has been straightforward			1
" @entity2 " has changed networks , switched names and was previously canceled , only to rise again			1
" i have mixed emotions , " executive producer @entity45 tells @entity0			0
" it 's had a great run			2
we had a lot of ups and downs			0
there 's been so much that 's happened to this family over the last 10 years			1
we 've seen them grow to a huge motorcycle shop			0
we 've seen them fight bitterly			0
we 've seen them sue each other			0
and recently we 've seen them come together to open up a new business			0
i think the show has come full circle			0
" " @entity2 " premiered as a @entity1 special in 2002 , then launched as a regular series a few months later			1
in 2008 , @entity1 moved the show to its sister channel @entity68			1
a couple years passed , then behind - the - scenes warring between @entity70 and @entity35 prompted @entity68 to outright cancel the show			2
@entity72 gives ' @entity2 ' duo advice parties soon made up , and in 2010 the company re-ordered the program as " @entity2 : @entity77			1
" the series later reverted to its original title and switched back to @entity1			1
" this was the first family docusoap , " @entity45 says			0
" they put on display , for all to see , what really happens in a tight family business , warts and all			0
i 'm really proud they were so open and honest			0
" @entity70 and @entity35 's spirited attitudes helped make the show engaging for fans , but could also make things difficult behind the scenes			2
at one point when shooting the current final season , @entity45 fired @entity35 and kicked him off the set			2
" it 's a very tumultuous relationship , not only between the father and son , but between us as well , " @entity45 says			1
