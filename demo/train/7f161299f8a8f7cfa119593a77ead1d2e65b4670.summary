@entity0 , @entity1 -- the name ' @entity3 ' may be gender - neutral , but it is also listed as a synonym for controversy			2
and at just 4 months old , blond - haired , blue - eyed storm and his @entity1 family have stirred a parenting debate still brewing across continents			0
@entity12 , 38 , and @entity13 , 39 are parents raising three children in @entity16			0
they feel children are pressured at far too tender an age by strict social norms of gender			2
and so , as a remedy , they felt it was better to keep the youngest child 's gender a secret -- even from the grandparents			1
according to a front - page article in the @entity34 last week , the only ones who know the baby 's gender are the couple 's sons -- @entity37 , 5 , and @entity38 , 2 -- a close family friend and two midwives present at delivery			1
instead of the usual birth announcement of ' it 's a boy ! ' or ' it 's a girl ! ' , @entity13 and @entity12 sent out an e-mail announcement that said , " we 've decided not to share @entity3 's sex for now -- a tribute to freedom and choice in place of limitation , a stand up to what the world could become in @entity3 's lifetime ( a more progressive place ? ... )			1
" not yet , apparently			0
comments about the article were so sharp and so divided that for now , the family has decided to decline any further media interviews			1
calls to their home by @entity2 were not returned			0
a message on the family voicemail says , " thanks for your interest in this important discussion , but at the moment , we 're really swamped and our first priority is the needs of our family and especially our kids			0
so , leave a message if you 'd like and we 'll respond to it whenever we 're able			0
" @entity12 and @entity13 may not be talking , but it seems everybody else is			0
from radio call - in shows all over the continent , to a " hot topic " discussion on @entity86 's " @entity85 , " few lacked an opinion			2
most said they were either appalled by the couple or applauded them for their courage			2
" they are shell - shocked by the reaction of people that have been quite vehement			0
they did n't really understand what would happen , " said @entity98 , managing editor of the @entity34			1
@entity98 said it was obvious from the very beginning -- even during meetings with his editorial staff -- that people could not help but express very divided opinions about the choice these parents are making			2
the article has become the newspaper 's most popular online story ever			1
one reader wrote : " wow , a good way to ruin your kid 's life			2
gender has nothing to do with sexuality			0
i think the parents are going to the extreme here			0
and what did someone do ? call all media and say , ' hey all , these people are keeping their poor child 's gender a secret ' ? ? what 's the hidden agenda here ? a reality show ? a book ? movie ? " but others countered that the couple 's decision was inspiring			1
" @entity135 to these parents for bravely taking on the gender - biased world that labels children with stereotypes and gendered assumptions before they are even born ! " one post read			1
" all parenting is an experiment -- but most people are happy to let @entity145 or @entity146 run the lab. i hope your beautiful little family will stay strong against the conservative attack			0
" in a follow - up article written by the @entity34 's @entity154 -- the only journalist so far to visit with the family -- the couple expressed dismay with all the reaction but says it is hopeful the debate can still be constructive			1
in the @entity34 article , @entity12 writes that , " is n't defensiveness sometimes a first sign of learning or changing behaviour , so even the ' rabid ' responses may have a place in making the world a more thoughtful place			1
