-- @entity2 driver @entity1 set the pace during practice for sunday 's @entity5			1
the @entity6 was quickest in both the morning and afternoon sessions as his rivals for the drivers ' championship lagged behind			2
@entity1 posted a lap of two minutes , 0.797 seconds in a rain - hit morning session but improved to record a second lap of one minute , 49.032 seconds in the more favorable afternoon conditions			1
@entity16 's @entity15 was 0.125 seconds behind @entity1 , while @entity18 's @entity17 came third			1
drivers ' championship leader @entity19 was left trailing by a full 2.6 seconds			1
@entity19 told @entity22 's official website : " today was a bit of a messy day with the changing conditions , but it was actually pretty good for us			1
we got some good information to go through and i 'm looking forward to tomorrow			0
" there are a few quick guys out there , but we 're not slow either			0
it 's hard to get a feel for what everyone 's doing with the changing weather			2
it 's a beautiful track here , it 's special - today we got to sample it in all conditions			2
" after the morning session was dominated by rain , the afternoon stint was delayed by a red flag , then concerns for the crowd after spectators appeared to climb onto fences for a better view of the track			0
it led to a chaotic end to the final session , but @entity1 managed to complete his quickest lap of the day shortly before time ran out			1
@entity1 told the @entity22 website : " the impression one gets on friday does not always get confirmed on saturday and sunday , therefore we have to evaluate today 's results with a lot of care			1
" having said that , it has definitely been a positive day , because the car seems to respond well in all track conditions that we encountered today			0
" @entity64 's @entity63 came fourth , @entity1 's teammate @entity65 was fifth , @entity66 came sixth in the @entity67 , while @entity68 was seventh overall -- four places behind @entity18 teammate @entity17			1
" the weather made it a bit of an up - and - down day , " @entity17 said			2
" it started off very wet , so we did n't do too much running in the morning			0
but we got a few more laps this afternoon on the intermediates and then the option tire			0
" because the rules do n't allow us to use too many wet - weather tires - we only have three extremes and four intermediates - we really need to look after them , so we were very cautious , just in case we need to use them later on in the weekend			0
" we 're definitely making small steps forward			0
this track does seem to suit our car better [ than in @entity89 ] , but let 's not get ahead of ourselves			0
" if it rains , then we seem to be competitive , but we have realistic expectations for this weekend - i did n't score in the last race , so it 's important that we get more points on the board on sunday			2
