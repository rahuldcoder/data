-- the news reports streaming out of the @entity2 this week have understandably focused on concerns @entity4 is working to build a nuclear weapon , challenging @entity7 's own widely believed but publicly undeclared nuclear arsenal and threatening stability across the region			1
@entity4 's record supporting terrorism in the @entity2 through groups like @entity13 in @entity14 elevates those concerns			1
some say president @entity17 only needs to give @entity7 prime minister @entity18 a " green light " to carry out an attack that would aim to damage or destroy @entity4 's nuclear enrichment facilities at the core of concerns			1
other @entity7 sources are insistent that the @entity26 military is better able to carry out the attacks and should therefore take the lead			1
nuclear weapons : who has what as the world marks 10 years since the @entity35 invasion , it might be a good time to look ahead and ask the decision - makers some basic questions about the threat and the strategy to deal with it			1
they 've been wrong before , but plenty of pundits are laying out a " spring or summer " timeline for military action			2
is this to be a pre-emptive strike ? in april , 2006 @entity4 president @entity47 stood onstage , surrounded by dancers holding glowing vials representing enriched uranium and declared : " i am officially announcing that @entity4 joined the group of those countries which have nuclear technology			2
" @entity4 has repeatedly denied it is trying to " weaponize " its nuclear program and spiritual leader @entity55 has even issued a fatwa in a speech against the production and use of weapons of mass destruction			1
the @entity62 says it has no evidence @entity4 is diverting its enriched uranium to make a weapon , but refuses to give @entity66 a clean bill because inspectors have been unable to visit a military location where nuclear weapon research could be conducted			2
there is no shortage of experts who believe @entity4 is doing everything it can to ready nuclear weapons technology so that if it considers itself threatened , it could produce one relatively quickly			2
the question is not whether @entity7 and the @entity26 would attack @entity4 if it developed a nuclear weapon			1
both states have said they will not allow @entity4 to possess nuclear weapons			0
the question is at what point @entity4 's capability to go nuclear is unacceptable			1
it is important because it 's relatively easy to bomb buildings and factories , but you ca n't bomb knowledge			0
what would be the @entity26 or @entity7 military goals ? any strategy that involves attacking @entity4 to control its nuclear program compels us to ask what the @entity26 and @entity7 hope to achieve ? will it be enough to shut down the nuclear enrichment process for a year ... two years ... five years ? in the event of a strike on its nuclear program , it is reasonable to assume @entity66 would immediately resume its research in deeper , hidden underground shelters			1
it may already be preparing to do that			0
the @entity26 can expect @entity4 would try to rebuild and improve on its past efforts with a vengeance			2
it is also reasonable to assume @entity4 would end cooperation with the @entity62 nuclear inspectors and the @entity26 , @entity109 and @entity7 would lose the window to look inside @entity4 's nuclear program , however imperfect it may be			1
a more important question the @entity26 needs to ask is whether a military attack strategy will force it into a " lawn mowing " ritual that has to be repeated , again and again ? military experts have been clear that a strike on @entity4 's nuclear program is n't going to be simple or easy			1
it might have to include scores of targets like radar installations , airfields and missile sites			0
those same military voices remind everyone there will be necessary bomb damage assessments -- possibly by drone , aircraft or satellite -- in the wake of any strike to determine what was damaged or missed			0
it all tends to add up to a very major military effort -- not the simple " one and done " raid @entity7 carried out on @entity35 's osirak nuclear reactor in 1981			2
the only way out of a cycle like this would seem to be negotiations , or perhaps even to learn to live with a nuclear capable @entity4			0
it bears mentioning because that 's precisely where the @entity26 and @entity7 are right now -- before taking on the high costs and high risks of another military " solution			1
" has the diplomatic route been exhausted ? @entity17 has repeatedly said there is " a window -- not an infinite period time , but a window of time -- where we can resolve this diplomatically			0
" this week , it became clearer than ever that @entity18 is growing impatient with the lack of progress that talks and sanctions have achieved			0
@entity7 and @entity4 are already locked in a covert war			2
since 2007 , @entity4 has alleged at least five of its nuclear scientists have been assassinated by @entity7 agents			1
there was no official response from @entity7			0
in july 2012 , a suicide bomber attacked a bus carrying @entity7 tourists in @entity167			0
five @entity7 were killed -- along with their @entity167 driver -- and a @entity167 investigation established links between the bomber and the @entity173 @entity14 group @entity13			0
so the most important question of all is : when does @entity26 give up on diplomacy with @entity4 ? @entity4 is different from other @entity2 countries in an important way			2
for decades , the @entity26 propped up @entity179 leaders and had , on the surface anyway , warm relations with them			0
but almost universally , the man in the street detested the @entity26 government			0
in @entity4 , it 's the man on the street who is largely supportive of @entity26			1
it 's the government and the extremists it trains that have all the hatred for what the @entity26 represents			0
perhaps the question right now is n't about giving up , but whether it 's time to double down on diplomacy to avoid a conflict that poses serious and unpredictable consequences .			0

pundits are laying out a spring - summer *timetable* if the @entity26 or @entity7 is to attack @entity4 's nuclear program
@entity0 's @entity202 says decision - makers need to ask basic questions first
how would *success* be assessed and how would @entity4 react ?
he points out @entity26 also *enjoys* great support on the @entity4 street unlike in many regional *neighbors*
