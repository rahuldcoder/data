-- @entity2 's world began to crumble friday when one of the students at the @entity6 middle school where he works walked up to him			1
something was happening at the elementary school less than 10 miles away where @entity2 's wife was principal , the student said , holding a computer			1
there were reports his wife had been killed			2
@entity2 rushed out of the building , one of dozens of family members of students and staff at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity6 , desperately seeking information about their loved ones that day			1
his wife , @entity25 , was in a meeting that morning when a 20 - year - old local man blasted his way into the elementary school armed with three guns			1
she stepped out of the meeting to find out what was going on and never returned			2
she was among the 26 people shot and killed inside the school by the gunman , @entity35 , who then turned a weapon on himself			1
twenty of the dead were children			2
as people across the world struggle to comprehend @entity35 's atrocious acts , @entity2 has been left with a future that no longer makes sense			1
he is more than 20 years older than his wife , who was 47 when she died			2
he never imagined he would outlive her			1
" @entity25 and i built this beautiful house in the @entity51 , our dream , " he said in an interview sunday night , sitting on a couch surrounded by his three daughters and one of his stepdaughters			2
" it was going to be @entity25 's house because i was going to die , " he said , explaining that they had included extra rooms in the house , so that their children and grandchildren could come keep his wife company after he was gone			2
" and now it 's me , " he said			0
" i do n't think i can do that			0
" he is now leaning on the support of their children and 11 grandchildren , but even that seems incongruous to him			0
" my job has always been to take care of other people , " he said			2
slain principal remembered as energetic , positive , passionate fittingly for two people who had made their careers in education , the couple met at a school , @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity6			1
it 's the same school where he was working friday			2
he was a good deal older when they met , but she was his superior in the school hierarchy : she was an assistant principal , and he was a seventh - grade math teacher			1
" i just fell in love with her , " he said			0
but it took a little while for him to persuade her to marry him : " she turned me down five times			0
" once he won her over , their wedding was influenced by their mutual love of sailing , taking place on a boat at sea near the @entity6 port of @entity103 a decade ago			0
they had both been married previously , and their union brought together three daughters on his side and two on hers			0
one of her two daughters , @entity113 , described a devoted mother			0
" every practice , she was there , " she said			0
" all of my sister 's cheerleadering stuff , she was there			0
she was doing homework on the bleachers , but she was there			0
and she was my rock			0
" @entity21 's commitment to her family was closely matched by her dedication to her students , according to friends and family members			1
" she was really nice and very fun , but she was also very much a tough lady in the right sort of sense , " according to @entity135 , a friend , whose niece goes to @entity21 and was uninjured friday			1
" she was the kind of person you 'd want to be educating your kids			0
and the kids loved her			0
" her decision to step out into danger when the shooting began has left her husband with some difficult emotions			1
" @entity25 put herself in jeopardy , and i have been angry about that , " he said			1
but that changed sunday , he said , when he met two teachers who told him that his wife had instructed them to take shelter while she confronted @entity35			0
" she could 've avoided that , " @entity2 said			0
" but she did n't ; i knew she would n't			0
so , i 'm not angry anymore			1
" his voice wavering , he continued : " i 'm not angry			1
i 'm just very sad			1

@entity21 was principal of the school were 26 people were *massacred*
her husband says he never imagined he would outlive her
he says he was *initially* angry she had put herself in danger by confronting the gunman
but now he says , " i 'm not angry . i 'm just very sad "
