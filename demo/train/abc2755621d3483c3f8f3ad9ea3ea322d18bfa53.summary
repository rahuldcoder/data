@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 administration has been talking about " pressing the reset button " with @entity6 after relations " crashed " when @entity6 invaded @entity8 last august			1
@entity6 foreign minister @entity9 and secretary of state @entity10 laugh about their " reset ' button			1
when secretary of state @entity10 greeted @entity6 foreign minister @entity9 in @entity1 on friday before sitting down to their working dinner , she presented him a small green box with a ribbon			1
@entity17 was a red button with the @entity6 word " peregruzka " printed on it			1
" i would like to present you with a little gift that represents what president @entity4 and vice president @entity23 and i have been saying and that is : ' we want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together			2
' " @entity28 , laughing , added , " we worked hard to get the right @entity6 word			1
do you think we got it ? " she asked @entity9			0
" you got it wrong , " @entity9 said			0
" it should be " perezagruzka " ( the @entity6 word for reset , ) @entity9 said			1
" this says ' peregruzka , ' which means ' overcharged			2
' " the question came up at the news conference afterward			0
" in a way , the word that 's on the button turns out to be also true , " @entity28 said			0
" we are resetting , and because we are resetting , the minister and i have an overload of work			0
" asked by a @entity6 reporter whether he had pressed the button , @entity9 said that he and @entity28 did , indeed			1
" it is big and red and i hope that @entity6 and the @entity55 , and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war , " he said			1
the " overload , " @entity28 said , is a broad agenda of issues			0
" we are going to systematically go through each and every one of them , " she added			0
@entity28 said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow - up to the @entity66 and nonproliferation			2
on other issues like @entity69 , the @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity28 said , " we will work through them			0
" on issues where there is disagreement , @entity28 said , " we are keeping those on the list because , we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other , we can even tackle some of those differences			0
" @entity9 agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is " enormous , " but added : " i do n't think either @entity10 or i have any desire to be freed from any burden			1
" @entity28 called the encounter " a very productive meeting of the minds			0
" she said both @entity9 and she are " very practical - minded " and will create a " specific set of objectives and responsibilities " to present to presidents @entity4 and @entity96 before the leaders ' first face - to - face meeting in april at the @entity100 meeting in @entity101			0
on the @entity103 treaty , she said @entity6 and the @entity55 intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are " going to get to work immediately " on it			1
@entity9 was asked about @entity6 intentions to install s - 300 missiles in @entity71			2
he said the decision " will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with @entity6 law , and will be under expert control , which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements			2
" @entity9 said the weapons @entity6 provides to its partners are " nondestabilizing , defensive weapons			2
" in an apparent reference to @entity55 military supplies to @entity8 , @entity9 said , " we want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where , including very recently , those weapons have been used very close to our borders			1
" senior @entity55 officials who briefed reporters afterward , however , said they had not read @entity8 into the minister 's comments			2
they said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and " we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined			0
" " it would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps , " one official said			0
on the proposed missile defense system the @entity55 is considering installing in @entity150 and the @entity151 , one official said , " minister @entity9 made it clear he had listened quite attentively to secretary @entity28 's comments about missile defense ... and i think it 's got them thinking			1
