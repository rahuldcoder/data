two men , @entity1 and @entity2 , were found guilty thursday of the murder of @entity5 soldier @entity4 near a military barracks in southeast @entity7 in may			1
their slaying of @entity4 , whom they mowed down and hacked to death in the full view of horrified onlookers in the capital 's @entity14 neighborhood , shocked the nation			1
cellphone footage replayed in court at the trial showed @entity1 , still clutching a meat cleaver in his bloody hands , ranting that the killing was " @entity23 , a tooth for a tooth " for @entity5 soldiers killing @entity27 overseas			1
the two were found not guilty of attempted murder of a police officer , in a verdict that took about 90 minutes to come at the @entity33 court in @entity7			1
@entity1 , 29 , and @entity2 , 22 , had pleaded not guilty to both charges			1
the two men are expected to be sentenced in january			0
@entity1 used the opportunity of a not guilty plea to defend himself in court and declare himself a warrior for @entity40			1
he saw himself as much of a soldier as @entity4 , who had previously served in @entity42 , and said he saw @entity43 as his " brothers in @entity45			2
" as he was led out of court after the verdict , @entity1 faced the media and kissed the quran he carried			1
@entity4 's family and widow , who were in court to hear much of the harrowing evidence , cried after the verdicts were read			1
in a statement outside the court , read by detective inspector @entity59 , the soldier 's family gave their thanks for the " overwhelming support " they 'd received and said they were proud of how @entity4 had served his country			1
" this is the toughest time of our lives			2
no one should have to go through what we 've been through as a family			0
we are satisfied that justice has been done but unfortunately no amount of justice will bring @entity4 back , " it said			2
" these people have taken him away from us forever but his memory lives on in all of us and we will never forget him			1
" the family , asking to be left alone to grieve in private , said they would now focus on the future of @entity4 's young son , @entity80			1
domestic terrorism threat the brutal attack , recorded on closed - circuit tv and by bystanders , brought the consequences of @entity5 support for wars in @entity42 and @entity88 after september 11 , 2001 , to @entity7 's suburbs			0
like attacks on @entity93 soldiers by @entity95 extremists on @entity93 soil , the attack on @entity4 caused political concern about the implications of domestic terrorism in a country that has fought @entity43 and @entity45 terrorism and also has a significant @entity27 population			2
however , although tensions were heightened in some areas after the attack , determined efforts by community leaders helped to prevent them from escalating			0
" this horrific attack and murder , which took place in broad daylight on the streets of @entity7 , shocked the whole country , " said assistant commissioner @entity108 , of @entity7 's @entity109 , following the verdict			1
" it was intended to divide our communities			0
it has had largely the opposite effect , and in fact brought people together			0
" @entity108 said the force supported the court 's decision to find the two men not guilty of the attempted murder of a police officer			1
" but i would also like to pay tribute to those firearms officers who were faced with a terrifying situation and displayed extreme courage and professionalism , " she said			0
the prosecution had argued that when they ran toward the police vehicle that responded after @entity4 's murder -- with @entity1 holding a knife and @entity2 a gun -- they intended to kill a police officer			1
however , the defense argued that the two men wanted to be killed by police			0
the gun was not loaded			0
@entity145 , head of the @entity147 's counterterrorism branch , said it would ask for the court to " find that this murder was motivated by terrorism when the defendants come to be sentenced , so that all options under counterterrorism legislation are available to the judge			1
" she added , " as a soldier , this young father had dedicated his life to keeping people safe , including from the threat of terrorism			0
that dedication to his country cost him his life , and was in stark contrast to the appalling conduct and extremist views of the men who murdered him			0
" home secretary @entity168 said the " sickening and barbaric murder " of @entity4 had " united the entire nation in condemnation			1
" " violence and extremism of any kind have absolutely no place in our society and can not be justified , " she said			0
protesters who gathered outside the @entity33 criminal court thursday demanded capital punishment for the two defendants			0
@entity5 does not have the death penalty			0
they ' seemed very proud ' summing up the case thursday morning , judge @entity184 reminded jurors of what happened in the 13 minutes between @entity4 's body being dragged into the middle of a road near the @entity14 barracks and the arrival of police			1
the judge quoted from statements made by witnesses who watched as the two men lingered at the scene			0
one described the defendants as " posing " and said they " seemed very proud of what they had in their hands			0
" another said : " they looked pleased with what they had done			0
" other statements quoted by the judge recounted how @entity1 spoke to bystanders , telling them " women and children are safe but keep back when the police and soldiers get here			2
" they recalled him talking about " muslim lands			0
" the judge also referred to the statements made by police who shot and disabled the defendants when they arrived at the scene			0
one described how a female officer who was driving the police vehicle feared she was going to die when @entity1 ran at the car and then again when @entity2 aimed a gun at her			1
the judge also cited details of @entity1 's police interview and witness testimony , including that he loved @entity43 , and that he had tried to cut off @entity4 's head because it was the proper method under @entity40			1
' moral conviction ' in his closing argument wednesday , lawyer @entity231 described @entity1 as intelligent , totally sincere in his beliefs and as someone who has shown " absolute honesty and moral conviction			2
" @entity1 had told the court he killed the soldier because he was fighting a war			2
while @entity1 took to the stand earlier this month , @entity2 did not give evidence at the trial			1
@entity2 's lawyer , @entity243 asked jurors to set aside their prejudice and emotion in the case			2
he echoed @entity1 's testimony regarding their intent			2
when he was asked earlier this month what his defense to the charge of murder was , @entity1 said : " i am a soldier			2
i am a soldier of @entity40			0
" both defense lawyers argued that was not the same as intent to murder			0
but the judge told the jury that the defense argument that the killing of @entity4 was an act of war or of retaliation did not apply in this case .			2
