-- call it the " mixed bag " year for women in the midterm elections			1
a few high - profile women candidates got a lot of attention on the national stage , but with dramatic @entity13 losses , the number of women in @entity11 will likely hold steady or decrease for the first time since 1987			1
the first female house speaker , @entity16 , and three @entity13 women committee chairs will lose their leadership positions in the majority , and consequently the overall political clout of women in the @entity22 will decrease			1
but not all the news for women in this election was bad			2
there were winners as well as losers -- and some groups were both			0
@entity31 women in @entity11 seven @entity31 newcomers in the @entity22 match the previous record of seven in one election , and two more in still - undecided races could join them			1
in addition , a new @entity31 woman , @entity37 from @entity38 , will join the @entity40			0
unfortunately , @entity31 women will occupy only about 10 percent of all @entity31 seats in the @entity22			0
many of the @entity31 women will lack seniority , especially with almost one - third of them newly elected , and few are likely to win leadership positions or committee chairs			1
the only @entity31 woman currently in leadership is @entity51 , vice chair of the @entity52			0
unless @entity31 take affirmative steps to promote women into leadership positions , the influence of @entity31 women in the 112th @entity11 will probably be very limited			1
in addition , @entity31 women candidates have had great difficulty surviving primaries			0
while a record number of @entity31 women ran in @entity22 primaries in 2010 , only 37 percent won , a much lower proportion than the 68 percent of @entity13 women who won their primaries			1
women of color women of color made significant breakthroughs in this election			2
two were elected governors : @entity73 of @entity74 is the first @entity76 - @entity75 woman and @entity77 of @entity78 the first @entity79 to head state governments			0
while the number of white @entity13 women serving in the next @entity11 will decline , the number of @entity13 women of color will increase			1
all four female democrats newly elected to the 112th @entity11 are women of color : three african - americans and one @entity89			1
one new @entity31 woman of color , @entity90 , a @entity79 , was elected to the @entity22 from @entity93			0
women in the headlines many women who received considerable national press attention in 2010 lost their races			1
the fanfare was of little help to @entity101 and @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 in @entity107 , and @entity108 in @entity109			0
of the women candidates in the national limelight , only @entity73 prevailed , perhaps despite national media attention			0
meanwhile , candidates who received far less attention , such as @entity77 and @entity37 , emerged along with @entity73 as the real female stars of this election			0
mama grizzlies some of the so - called " mama grizzlies " endorsed by @entity119 won while others lost			1
@entity119 's support for candidates brought no guarantee of election			2
all three of her female gubernatorial candidates in the general election -- @entity73 , @entity127 , and @entity77 -- won , but two of her favored gubernatorial candidates lost primaries in @entity131 and @entity132			2
mama grizzlies running for the @entity40 fared less well , with three losing ( @entity106 , @entity134 , and @entity102 ) and just one winning ( @entity37 )			0
three of @entity119 's endorsed @entity22 candidates lost in primaries , but two - thirds of those who made it through to the general election won their races -- a strong showing			1
@entity119 and @entity144 for different reasons , @entity119 and @entity144 , two women not on ballots in 2010 , may have been among the biggest beneficiaries of this year 's elections , with future presidential prospects enhanced			1
although her mama grizzlies fared so - so in the elections , @entity119 , through her active involvement and candidate endorsements in 2010 , increased her public visibility and perceived political clout			2
perhaps even more important , governors in several states , including women in @entity78 , @entity74 and @entity160 , will be beholden to her			0
they could be critical to a 2012 bid for the @entity31 nomination			0
clearly , @entity119 's presidential prospects are stronger now than a year ago			2
if @entity119 benefited from being in the limelight in 2010 , @entity144 benefited by being absent from it			1
as secretary of state , @entity168 had no direct involvement in the elections and consequently remained above the fray as @entity13 suffered losses of historic proportion , president @entity167 's popularity plunged , and both @entity167 and vice president @entity175 appeared ineffectual at best in rallying voters behind @entity13 candidates			2
@entity168 remains popular , retaining her image as a strong and effective leader			0
although it 's unclear whether she will run for the presidency before 2016 , if at all , @entity144 in 2010 appears a stronger - than - ever potential contender			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity188 says midterms a mixed bag for women ; number in @entity11 static
she says when @entity13 lost ; so did @entity13 women in leadership positions
@entity199 : women of color gained in @entity11 and in gubernatorial races
@entity199 : big winners may be @entity119 and @entity144
