six weeks before winning the 1998 @entity2 crown , 18 - year - old @entity0 was raped at knife - point by a travel agent escorting her home to @entity6 from a modeling gig in @entity8			1
her mother encouraged her to report the attack and go on to compete in the pageant on behalf of @entity6			2
just as her mother supported her , @entity0 is now trying to empower other victims of sexual assault to speak up			1
@entity0 's journey from beauty queen to activist is chronicled in the @entity18 - nominated documentary , " @entity19			1
" " it was her mom 's reaction telling her , ' do n't worry , it was n't your fault , go to police , do n't take a shower , ' that changed her life			1
it gave her the courage to report the crime , " said @entity29 , who produced the film with @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
after her rapist was convicted in 1999 , @entity0 stopped speaking publicly about the attack and retreated from the public eye			1
in 2008 , she re-emerged , encouraging victims of sexual violence to share their stories -- and invited the filmmakers to follow her journey			1
" @entity19 " follows @entity0 from @entity46 to @entity47 , where she speaks with rape survivors , to rallies on @entity51 college campuses and the halls of @entity6 @entity53 , all the way to the scene of her attack in @entity8			1
along the way she works through family relationships , embraces @entity60 and deals with her own trauma			2
" the film is really about the courage it takes to fight for justice and speak up for rape and assault			2
it 's about the making of an activist , " @entity29 said			1
@entity73 's rants inspire # yesallwomen conversation nominated for a 2014 @entity18 in @entity76 , the film goes beyond the screen to empower victims of sexual violence to speak up through its website , in community screenings and on social media			1
@entity82 spoke with @entity29 and @entity31 in may about what it took to complete the film and how it continues to have an impact			2
the following transcript has been edited for length and clarity : @entity82 : why did you decide to release this movie now ? @entity29 : it 's hard to craft a narrative out of a taboo subject			1
we 've been working on the film for five years			2
it just happened to ( debut ) at a time that coincides with what feels like national attention being turned to this issue			2
our timing came from @entity0 being ready to speak out about the rape after a long period of healing			1
it took her 11 years after her assault -- and winning the crown , and spending years in court , and retreating -- to heal			1
@entity31 : it was important for @entity0 to inject real meaning to the crown			1
she felt the title was meaningless unless she did something with it			2
she knew it gave her a platform that people would listen to , it would amplify the message			1
she had already made a difference in her country after speaking publicly in the rape trial			0
she told women in @entity6 , " if i could do it , you can do it , too			0
report , do n't stay silent , " and the number of reports of rape to police and crisis centers rose dramatically and [ authorities ] attributed it to her , along with new legislation inspired by case			0
she was hoping to reach a broader audience on a global scale by doing outreach and activism , and a documentary would help her reach that audience			1
@entity82 : why do you think she was ready ? peck : ever since her rape , women been have been writing to her from all over saying you gave me courage to tell somebody			0
with a film she hoped to reach more people than she could in person			0
with the website she wanted to give survivors a place to connect			0
by filming her story the message could go much broader			0
@entity31 : she felt ready to take this on with the 10 - year anniversary of ( winning ) the crown			1
everything came together in 2008			0
she felt very strong and ready to take this on , and neither of us had any idea that it would turn out the way it did , that it would be so difficult , that it would be re-traumatizing			0
@entity82 : tell me more about those difficulties			0
how did she experience trauma all over again ? peck : it started when she found out ( her rapist ) was getting furloughs from prison			0
she realized she was n't as strong as she thought , that it was n't completely behind her , and it can trigger symptoms of ptsd			0
she began fighting to keep him in prison for the duration of his sentence , not to release him early			0
as well as telling her stories over and over again , and hearing stories all over the world about how pervasive ( rape ) is , that things have n't come so far , it 's still difficult to access justice , all those things made the journey much harder than we thought			1
and , we did have to stop at a point for six months , and we did n't know if the film would get finished			0
@entity82 : how does the film relate to the current cultural discussion of " rape culture " and efforts to reform school policies around reporting sexual misconduct ? peck : the central part of story is about college campuses and talking about how life is adversely affected by rape and sexual assault			0
with her story , the website and the work ( of student activists ) , it feels like we 're all working toward the same goal to make things safer on college campuses			0
@entity82 : what do people share ? is there a common theme ? peck : we hear more about the need for better and extensive training for administrations to respond to rape			0
we keep hearing there is n't adequate training , and ( survivors ) do n't always have access to @entity236 coordinators ; there 's nowhere to go where they feel safe about reporting or talking about assault and rape			1
student activists really are making a difference			0
i think they 're putting pressure on schools to make schools safer			0
@entity82 : how do you measure the film 's success ? @entity31 : on our microscopic level we 're trying to quantify outreach and success by how many people are speaking up at our screenings or on the website			1
we 've seen an increase in the number of stories and people sharing on our page or engaging in discussion on @entity264 using # @entity265			0
peck : we felt a real responsibility to make a film that would resonate with audiences around the world and amplify @entity0 's message of how important it is to not be ashamed and not to stay silent			1
when you 're responsible for a message like that it 's deeply engaging ; it 's a crusade			2
it 's hard to raise money and stay with it for so long			2
but you feel in the end that you have done something that could make a difference in this world .			0
