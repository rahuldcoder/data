-- @entity1 says searching for his daughter feels something like bleeding out			0
all the hope , heartache and anxiety that go into it leave him feeling diminished			0
but the @entity9 lawyer and amateur guitarist has managed to bottle up some of that energy , spending hundreds of hours creating what is both a tribute to @entity14 and a monument to his sorrow : a 14 - song album he has published to @entity19 vendors			1
" finding @entity23 " includes 11 songs written and performed by @entity14 at his home studio , as well as the last three songs @entity23 herself recorded at home before the 23 - year - old disappeared in april 2010 while hiking alone in @entity27			1
the case is unsolved , and the album -- for sale on @entity31 and other outlets -- is a fundraiser for an investigation into her disappearance			1
" so many people who know us say , ' what is it like ? ' or ' i ca n't imagine what it 's like to have your daughter go missing , ' " @entity1 said in a phone interview			2
" the album tells the whole story : feeling helpless , feeling like you want to celebrate your daughter , feeling like she may never come back and diminishing yourself as you look for her			2
" @entity23 disappeared toward the end of a five - month post-college trip in @entity52			1
the 2009 @entity54 graduate , who had a double major in psychology and art , went to @entity58 to teach yoga to vacationers before traveling to @entity61 to study yoga and volunteer to help schoolchildren with music and art. she hoped to do charitable work , perhaps hooking up with a nongovernmental organization abroad , her dad said			0
but she vanished on the last stop of her trip , in @entity27 's @entity71 , where she hiked for at least two days			1
she initially was believed to have made it as far as a particular village on the hike 's second day , but villagers there changed their stories and said they did n't see her after all			2
investigators do n't know what happened to her and have yet to find any physical trace of her			0
@entity1 , 59 , and his wife @entity81 have taken trips to @entity27 to press the investigation , working with private investigators , @entity27 police and the @entity27 army to try to determine what happened			1
between his job and his investigation , @entity14 found at least three hours a day for more than a year to create the album			1
playing all the instruments , supplying all the vocals and recording and mixing the tracks , he grieved through music			0
he came up with a first version last year before publishing the finished product in april			0
" my counselor said that he felt that was extremely healthy for me as an outlet , because that was how ( @entity23 and @entity102 ) related to each other , through music and art , " @entity14 said			1
there are songs of tribute and nostalgia			0
" @entity114 " recalls @entity23 growing up -- painting , going to a father - daughter dance , wearing a homemade dress to graduation			1
" i 've written songs since i was 10 years old			0
i never wrote a song that i was crying onto the paper so much that the pen would n't write -- until then , " @entity14 said			1
the album also shows moments of determination			0
in " @entity122 , " @entity14 sings of moving heaven and @entity124 for her			2
" your pictures all hang in these empty rooms / i know you 'll be here , soon , " he sings			0
in much of the album , though , @entity14 works through despair and isolation			2
" now we 're the car wreck on the road / people turn their heads and drive away from here , " he sings in " @entity132 " " @entity139 " speaks in part to the investigation 's magnitude : " stare into the darkness / and it 'll stare right back at you / from the other side of the world / i think it 's going to run me through			2
" listeners also get to hear @entity23 , in songs that @entity14 asked her to record before she left			1
they used to play music together , and he knew she was working on a few songs in the months before her trip			0
" the night she was packing for @entity58 , i asked her , ' honey , i really want you to record these songs , ' " @entity14 said			2
" she said , ' why ? ' i said , ' just in case something happens to you			0
' " @entity23 's songs were rough recordings , not meant to be final products			1
but @entity14 is grateful to have them and says they " give you a flavor of where she 's coming from			2
" @entity14 believes one of her songs , " my heart knows , " was an " accept - me - for - who - i - am " sort of song , addressed primarily to a romantic interest but possibly to whoever listens			1
" please let me be me / person you 're afraid to be / but do n't worry , i know where to go / i know , because my heart knows , " @entity23 sings			2
@entity14 , who did n't particularly want @entity23 traveling alone , said the song offers a good glimpse at his strong - willed daughter			1
he has sold several hundred copies so far , and that 's a few hundred dollars more for the family 's investigation fund			0
he 's grateful to have had the chance to explain what he 's feeling though music			0
@entity14 hoped the disappearance would be solved by the time the album was done			1
since he finished it , he has n't been able to write much			0
the two relatively new half - songs he 's written still are about @entity23 , but he says he does n't have the energy to complete them			1
" the biggest thing was to bury myself in my work at the law office ( after the album ) , " he said			0
" that seems to be a good place to hide			0
