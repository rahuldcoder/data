-- international correspondent @entity1 reports from the site of @entity3 , a controversial settlement that the @entity6 government plans to build			1
what is @entity3 ? i was standing on the barren @entity9 of @entity10 and it is hard to believe the area could be at the center of an international controversy			2
@entity3 stands for @entity15 and marks territory that the @entity6 government has slated for settlement construction in the @entity18			1
it 's about 12 square kilometers ( 4.6 square miles ) , and when completed will touch the outskirts of @entity10			0
the construction in the @entity3 area would be an expansion of one of the largest @entity6 settlements in the @entity18 , @entity25 , with about 40,000 inhabitants , and would merge it with the greater @entity10 area			1
why has the plan caused so intense international reaction ? after the @entity31 vote on november 29 to grant the @entity32 the status of a non-member observer state in the body , @entity6 announced settlement construction in the @entity18 and @entity10 as a response , saying part of that would likely take place in the @entity3 area			1
the @entity32 believe construction here would essentially cut the @entity18 in half and could also impede access from the @entity18 to @entity10 , which the @entity32 would like to see as the capital of any future @entity32			1
in an interview with @entity0 , the @entity32 ' chief negotiator @entity46 condemned the plan saying : " there is no chance for a @entity32 state			0
i mean it is impossible			0
anyone who looks at the map , looks at the geography will know exactly that this decision means that there is no more two - state solution			0
" how many @entity6 settlements are there ? according to the settlement monitoring group @entity63 , there are currently 137 @entity6 settlements in the @entity18 , with about 325,000 inhabitants in total			1
the settlements are essentially @entity6 towns of various sizes in @entity32 territory			1
many of them , like @entity25 , look almost like any other @entity6 town with everything from supermarkets to shopping malls and schools			0
what is their legal status ? the legal status of the settlements is in dispute			0
the @entity31 and many scholars of international law consider them illegal , but @entity6 and some experts like the late @entity86 of the @entity87 and @entity88 , international law professor at the @entity89 , have said they are legal			2
the @entity32 want @entity6 to give up most settlements as part of any future two - state solution , but many believe that is not realistic considering the size of some of them			1
how do settlements impact the peace process ? settlements are one key reason why there have been no negotiations between the @entity6 and @entity32 for several years			1
the @entity32 say they will only return to the table if @entity6 freezes all settlement construction , while @entity107 's government wants negotiations without preconditions			1
the dispute over new construction in the @entity3 sector is adding fuel to the fire and the @entity31 believes it might destroy any chance of a two - state solution for good			2
how would ordinary @entity32 be affected by @entity3 development ? for average @entity32 in the area , the concerns are immediate			2
@entity120 , a taxi driver in the town @entity121 near @entity10 , told me he fears additional detours and checkpoints if settlements are constructed in the @entity3 area			2
" if they build this settlement and close off our roads it will mean that my trip from @entity134 to @entity135 would take between five hours to a whole day			0
" how about people currently living in the settlement ? @entity25 's mayor @entity138 is happy at the prospect of expanding the settlement , a project that has been on hold for years			0
" this place , this residential neighborhood , it is in the @entity25 municipality , part of @entity25 municipality , government land			0
it has to be built for our young couples , " he told me from his office .			0

@entity6 plans to begin construction of settlements in the @entity15 1 , or @entity3 , zone in the @entity18
comes after the @entity31 voted to grant @entity159 non-member observer status
@entity32 believe construction here would essentially cut the @entity18 in half
group : currently 137 @entity6 settlements in the @entity18 , with about 325,000 inhabitants
