-- @entity1 was " goth " in high school			1
she had , and still has , multicolored hair , a " face full of piercings , " and an all - black wardrobe , even though she no longer identifies with the goth subculture			2
and while her style had always earned her her fair share of strange glances , she says everything changed for the worse after the @entity13 school shootings on april 20 , 1999			1
@entity1 , in all black , decided to study at home after feeling shunned as a goth after @entity13			1
it was on that day that @entity18 and @entity18 killed 12 students and teachers in a shooting spree at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
the massacre was one of the deadliest school shootings in history , and it had a profound effect on students and teachers across the country			1
as the media and the public groped for meaning behind the incident , there were plenty of theories about the motive behind the massacre			0
one of these was that @entity18 and @entity18 were members of the goth subculture , or " trench - coat mafia " as they were known at @entity13 , and thus had been outcasts			1
this theory has been widely refuted , but for goth students around the country , the damage was done			1
" as a result [ of @entity13 ] , the public were afraid of the ' goths ' and ' punks ' and ' metalheads ' at school , " says @entity1 , who was a high school senior at the time			1
" parents , often successfully , lobbied to get trench coats and all - black attire banned in their local schools			2
school administrators started considering these groups to be gangs and harassment of students was rampant , with unwarranted backpack searches , detainment in the hallways by security guards , and being called into the administrative offices for questioning			2
" rumors ran rampant about kids who " looked like they were going to bring a gun to school , " and @entity1 says her classmates quickly learned if they wanted to cause trouble for a student , all they had to do was report that student had a list of enemies			1
" they could simply report to administrators that the person had an ' enemies list ' and the school would quickly swoop in to rectify the situation , even when it was n't the truth			0
... the accused would forever be known as ' the kid with the list ' and ostracized , " she says			2
because of this and the new dress code restrictions , her goth friends " were afraid to go to school			2
" @entity1 herself caught so much flak for her appearance that she went into home studies			1
and though she was no longer in school , discrimination could n't be avoided			0
people in town would cross to the other side of the street to avoid her and her friends , she says			0
ireport.com : ' sadly , teens still tend to shun those who are different than they are ' @entity1 was even interviewed by the national media about her experiences after @entity13			1
at first she regretted it and feared backlash			0
" i had already gotten enough crap since @entity13 about wearing all black , " she says			1
but she was glad she did it after receiving e-mails from other students who identified with her and thanked her for the interviews , including one girl who was suicidal until reading an article about her			2
" one girl even had e-mailed me and said [ she ] was coming home to write a suicide note ... and kill herself after school			0
she read the article about me and it made her think twice , " says @entity1			1
" in the article , i said it 's not worth letting these people get to you			0
it 's not up to them to tell you that you 're wrong			0
" " [ to have ] a 14 - year - old e-mail me ... it was just , like , whoa , i do n't care who says anything bad ... i helped someone , " says @entity1			1
" to this day that just sticks with me			0
anything i do in my life -- nothing 's going to measure to that , the fact that i helped someone realize that there 's more to life			2
" things changed for teachers after @entity13 , too			1
many say they realized they were n't just responsible for their students ' knowledge , but for their overall well - being			2
" life was never the same after that day , " says @entity153 , a veteran teacher from @entity154 , @entity155			2
schools across the country instituted new security measures such as see - through backpacks and metal detectors , and teachers were trained to deal with violent behavior			1
but more than that , says @entity153 , " teachers and students are always just a little afraid			1
" " @entity13 said to me as an educator was that we in the education community hold people 's lives in our hands			1
... we as educators have a much higher duty , a much higher call , than just to teach our subject areas			0
... @entity13 was to education what 9/11 was to the @entity179 : a shattering wake - up call , a disaster so profound , it permanently changed our world view			1
" ireport.com : ' education is literally a matter of life and death ' @entity188 remembers a similar wake - up call after the shooting			1
she was a first - year teacher in @entity191 , @entity192 , at the time			0
" i think most people who go into teaching have the desire to go out there and change the world and enlighten kids and bring them to this great level of knowledge , " she says			0
" i remember when it happened , all of a sudden , it was like : ' how can i give them all of this knowledge if i ca n't keep them safe ? ' i realized at that moment that my job was n't just giving them academic learning , it was also about protecting them and making them feel like they 're in a safe place			0
" this realization hit home for her when her school had a lockdown			0
teenagers from another part of town had entered the school , allegedly looking for a student there			0
a school security guard apprehended them right outside the door to @entity227 's classroom			0
" i remember thinking , what would happen if somebody actually walked in the door ? ... and that 's when it hit me , that the kids have to be able to trust me as their teacher to protect them regardless of who walks through that door			0
i told the kids , this is real , and i am the one in control and i will protect you			0
... and i found out afterward that virtually every teacher in the building did the exact same thing			0
the kids looked to us and knew we were there to keep them safe			0
" @entity227 also means " safe " in a different way			0
it includes protecting her students from physical harm , yes , but also protecting them from bullying or social stigmas that could potentially lead to violent behavior			1
some investigators have said there is evidence to suggest the @entity13 shooters were victims of bullying or ostracism , and @entity227 says this is a nationwide problem			1
" what happened at @entity13 could happen virtually anywhere			2
kids get picked on , and it could get to a point where they snap			0
they 're human beings , " she says			0
