-- in the last week , @entity1 has gone from an unknown professional basketball player struggling to get time on court to an overnight sporting and media sensation			1
@entity0 takes a closer look at the first @entity8 - born player of @entity10 or @entity11 descent to play in the @entity12 , and how he 's becoming more popular with every game			1
who is @entity1 ? born to parents @entity15 and @entity17 on august 23 , 1988 , @entity1 is an @entity18 - @entity8 @entity12 player for the @entity19			1
he wears the jersey no. 17 and plays as point guard			0
as a professional basketballer he 's not overly tall , measuring 6 feet , 3 inches ( 191 centimeters ) and weighs 200 pounds ( 90.7 kilograms )			0
he played for four years at @entity23 , and has spent just one year as a professional player			2
career highlights : following his stint at @entity23 ( where he was twice named to the all - @entity27 ) , @entity1 failed to get drafted by an @entity12 franchise , and instead signed as a free agent with the @entity30 in july , 2010			1
in december 2011 , @entity1 signed with the @entity19 after being cut by the @entity31			2
his 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed @entity34 's to become the most by any player since the @entity12 - @entity37 merger in 1976			1
' @entity38 ' : why the hype ? everyone loves a battle - against - the - odds story , and @entity1 fits the bill perfectly			2
the reasons for his meteoric rise to become a @entity8 basketball sensation are numerous , but it all starts with talent			0
in just weeks he 's gone from one - time bench - warmer to team savior , leading the @entity19 to five straight victories and averaging more than 20 points per game , while his field goal percentage during this winning streak tops 50 %			1
in friday 's game against @entity57 's @entity56 , he reeled off 38 points in that victory alone			2
@entity1 also stands out due to his academic prowess , being the only current @entity12 player who has a @entity23 degree , and is the first @entity23 graduate to play in the league for almost 60 years			1
@entity23 grad @entity1 has shot at basketball immortality then there 's the race factor : @entity1 is the first @entity8 - born player of @entity10 or @entity11 descent to play in the @entity12 , which is helping to tap into the significant market of @entity18 basketball fans			1
this in turn is spilling over to @entity12 devotees in general			0
why @entity1 's race matters " he 's amazing , how could you not be excited , " asked a punter watching @entity77 in a bar in @entity79 on saturday			0
" i mean look at the @entity19 , have you followed them for the last 10 years ? and then this guy shows up and he knows how to play the game -- you 've got to be excited			1
" his ethnicity is even having an effect globally -- even though @entity1 has n't built up celebrity status in the @entity10 leagues like retired center @entity88 did , the @entity10 interest is already there , with 900,000 followers on @entity91 , @entity10 's answer to @entity92 , already secured			1
the @entity12 has also said its tv partners in @entity94 will soon start showing @entity19 games			2
on top of his athletic and academic abilities , @entity1 is also drawing fans for his public devotion to @entity101 who are thinking about the role model he 'll be for their children			0
@entity1 has said he was raised in the church and became a @entity107 in high school			0
after beating the @entity56 on friday , he said , " i just give all the praise to @entity110			0
" he also said in an interview in 2010 that he wants to be a pastor post-nba			0
a marketer 's dream from a marketing perspective for the @entity19 , @entity1 's popularity is proving a boon -- last week his @entity119 jersey was outselling those of @entity121 and @entity57			2
and with the pr damage from the recent @entity12 lockout and the steady decline of old superpowers like the @entity56 and the @entity127 , the league is looking for new personalities to draw fans into the sport			0
with his multicultural attraction , @entity27 background and come - from - nowhere storyline , @entity1 has that in spades .			0
