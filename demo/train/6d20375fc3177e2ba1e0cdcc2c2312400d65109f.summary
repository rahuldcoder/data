if you thought golf was the stuffy reserve of mild - mannered gentlemen in polo shirts , think again			0
from @entity7 outfits to leaping into jacuzzis and even smashing lettuce heads to smithereens , there 's no antic too crazy for new masters champion @entity10			1
the 33 - year - old born - again @entity12 's bizarre internet home videos have attracted a cult following that could change the face of golf forever			1
" @entity20 , " as he 's come to be known , has harnessed social media in a way no golf pro has done before			1
the @entity24 's slapstick - style @entity23 clips see him using wooden clubs to pound pumpkins and eggplants , drawing more than a million hits as of tuesday			1
similarly , @entity10 's @entity30 page has more than 65,000 likes , while his @entity33 followers number almost half a million -- ballooning by more than 150,000 since sunday 's miraculous win at @entity35			1
he still has some way to go to catch @entity37 , who has more than two million followers on both networking websites , but it could herald a brave new social media era for golf stars -- one which experts say may open the sport 's doors to a previously ignored younger generation			1
" @entity46 has always been seen as a safe game			0
it 's not overly flamboyant and i think it 's still largely viewed as an elitist sport , " @entity48 , group head of international sales at @entity51 - based social video advertising company @entity50 , told @entity52			2
" the fact that there is this guy who is quite an eccentric individual -- everything from his name , his dress sense , his pink driver -- certainly sets him apart from the crowd			0
" it 's great because much like snooker , golf desperately needs that attention from a younger audience			2
and social media is an effective way of getting it			1
every sport should have its personality , and football has been very good at that			0
i think @entity10 is golf 's answer to that personality			1
" there 's no denying @entity10 's intriguing character			1
the devout @entity12 tweeted " to @entity88 be the glory ! " in response to his masters win and bawled on his mother 's shoulder after hitting an astonishing shot from the woods onto the green to take the title			2
@entity10 , who with wife @entity90 adopted a son , @entity91 , two weeks ago , also boasts of never having a golf lesson			1
last year he left more people scratching their heads when he and fellow @entity96 players @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 launched boy band @entity100			0
kitted out in nothing but a pair of overalls , @entity10 recorded the song " oh oh oh " to help raise money for charity			2
but it 's @entity10 's dedication to social media which has given fans a special insight into his unconventional life			1
incredibly , he replies to every single tweet , which no doubt helped to swell his legion of followers from 306,000 after his win on sunday to more than 460,000 less than a day later			0
his @entity30 page features albums of family vacations and home videos from fans ' children practicing their best @entity10 - style shots			2
@entity10 is quick to comment on every post from the public			2
" he 's very engaged with social media			1
his music video had four million views and all these things help make @entity10 a likeable character , " @entity48 said			0
" they give him mass appeal , not like the seriousness you have with a traditional golfer			0
" it also helps raise his profile among sponsors			0
though as @entity48 admitted : " on the flipside , it does potentially make things difficult if things go wrong , as we saw with @entity37 's romantic profile recently			0
five years ago it was inconceivable that a sporting personality would have an entire global audience at his fingertips			0
it opens up a whole new debate on how much sponsors can control their stars			0
" it could work both ways -- some sponsors might be put off by his level of eccentricity			0
