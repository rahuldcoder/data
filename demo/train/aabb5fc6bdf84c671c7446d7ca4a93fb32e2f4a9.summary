@entity0 , @entity1 -- recently , at 48 years of age , i was diagnosed with @entity6 's syndrome			1
for most of my life , i knew that i was " other , " not quite like everyone else			1
i searched for years for answers and found none , until an assignment at work required me to research autism			1
during that research , i found in the lives of other people with @entity6 's threads of similarity that led to the diagnosis			1
although having the diagnosis has been cathartic , it does not change the " otherness			1
" it only confirms it			1
when i talk to people about this aspect of myself , they always want to know what it means to be an " @entity6 , " as opposed to a " @entity31 " ( @entity31 )			1
oh , dear , where to start			2
... the one thing people seem to know about @entity6 's , if they know anything at all , is the geek factor			1
@entity37 is rumored to be an @entity6			1
we tend to have specialized interests , and we will talk about them , ad infinitum , whether you are interested or not			2
recognizing my tendency to soliloquize , i often choose silence , although perhaps not often enough			2
due to our extensive vocabularies and uninflected manner of speaking , we are called " little professors , " or arrogant			2
i do n't quite understand small talk , and early in my adult life , solecisms were frequent			2
at meetings , i launch into business without the expected social acknowledgments			2
it 's not that i do n't care about people , i am just very focused on task			1
do you have to rehearse greeting people to reinforce that you should do it ? i do			1
i am lucky to have a very dear friend who savors my eccentricities			2
she laughs , lovingly , about one particular evening at a restaurant			2
before she could get seated , i asked her what she knew about the golden ratio and began to spew everything i know about it			2
i re-emphasize how lucky i am to have her as a friend , because this incident occurred long before i was diagnosed			2
a misconception is that @entity6 do not have a sense of humor			1
it is true that we can be very literal , so we often miss the humor in everyday banter , but we can and do enjoy even subtle humor			2
our literal interpretations , however , can be problematic			2
in first grade , whenever someone made a mess in the classroom , the teacher would ask a student to get the janitor			0
the student would come back with mr. @entity87 ( not really his name ) , who carried a broom and large folding dustpan			0
when i was asked to get the janitor , i looked all over the school and reported back to the teacher that i could not find it			0
after all , the person was mr. @entity87 , so the janitor must be the object , right ? i lack the ability to see emotion in most facial expressions			0
i compensate for this deficiency by listening to the inflections in people 's voices and using logic to determine emotional context			1
the words people choose , their movements , or even how quickly they exit a meeting can provide clues to emotion			1
i also have intensified senses -- touch , taste , smell , sight , and sound -- so i am attuned to lights , noise , textures , and smells			1
in a " busy " environment , i will eventually go into sensory overload and my mind will go blank			0
when this happens , i have to " go away " mentally for a brief period to regain focus			0
when i " return , " i have to piece together what occurred while i was " away			0
" the additional mental processing i must do to function every day is fatiguing , and i do n't handle " ad hoc " very well			0
being asked to respond quickly in the midst of all this other processing is difficult , sometimes impossible			0
i am so sensitive to touch that a tickle hurts me			0
this is the hardest concept for most people to understand			1
how can a tickle hurt ? all i can tell you is that it does , so i avoid being touched except by those who have learned how to touch me			0
hugs are dispensed infrequently , but if i do hug someone , i resemble frankenstein 's monster , arms extended to control contact			1
when my dad ( who i suspect is an @entity6 , too ) and i hug , we both have " the approach			1
" we sometimes miss and have to re-approach a couple of times until a brief , awkward hug is achieved			0
in school , other children noted my differences , and i was bullied ( and tickled into fits of despair ) for years			0
already needing extended periods of time alone , my response was to become even more of a loner			0
when you are weird , you are a joke			0
when you are a loner , you frighten people			1
it 's always the quiet ones			1
... i am married ( wow ! ) , and my brilliant husband is an absolute sweetheart			0
i do n't know any other man who has the self - confidence to be pushed away ( sometimes sharply ) , both physically and mentally , as often as he has been			0
he has been gentle and patient ( and , yes , frequently emotionally depleted ) as we both worked through my need for space , tendency to go so deep into my own world that the real world and everyone in it cease to exist , and sensitivity to touch during the 26 ( soon to be 27 ) years of our marriage			0
i live with anxiety , because the world can be overwhelming and people have expectations that i always , sooner or later , fail to meet			1
i can not begin to tell you how many times i have been told that i am rude , inaccessible or cold , yet i have never purposely tried to harm anyone , nor do i mean to be , well , mean			0
i could tell you so much more , but instead let me share one last insight			0
do n't pity me or try to cure or change me			0
if you could live in my head for just one day , you might weep at how much beauty i perceive in the world with my exquisite senses			1
i would not trade one small bit of that beauty , as overwhelming and powerful as it can be , for " normalcy			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
