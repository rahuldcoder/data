-- one video showed the tiny face of the slain girl wrapped in a shroud			1
someone pulled back a bandage to show her bloodied right eye			2
her mouth was frozen , slightly ajar			0
her vacant face and lifeless head conjured the image of an alabaster bust			0
another more gruesome video showed the girl before she was cleaned for burial			1
she lay sprawled on a pavement , bloodied and disheveled , like a crime victim caught in a tabloid snapshot			0
