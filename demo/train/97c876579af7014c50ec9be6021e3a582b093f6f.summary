@entity0 -- hundreds of millions around the world have been dazzled by the sights and sounds of director @entity6 's opening ceremony for the @entity7			1
the four - hour , Â £ 27 million ( $ 42.4 million ) spectacle contained references to such globally - recognized @entity11 icons such as @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 's @entity14			1
but with the production tossing out historical and cultural references at a rapid rate , even the most ardent anglophiles in the audience may have felt some allusions whiz over their head like an airborne nanny			2
the @entity25 - winning director of " @entity26 " says the ceremony , titled " @entity28 , " was inspired by a passage in @entity31 's @entity30 , believed to have been written in 1610 and set on a remote , magical island			1
although that phrase itself appears nowhere in the play , the character @entity33 refers to his home as an isle " full of noises , sounds and sweet airs , that give delight and hurt not			2
" the line encapsulates the vision fellow film director @entity44 , the ceremony 's creative director , says the production sought to represent , in capturing " the rich heritage , diversity , energy , inventiveness , wit and creativity that truly defines the @entity54			1
" the ceremony opened with a scene inspired by the work of another @entity59 literary genius , the romantic visionary poet and painter @entity61 : specifically , the preface to his epic " @entity63 " -- " and did those feet in ancient time , " better known as " @entity65			1
" written in 1804 , the poem was set to music in 1916 by sir @entity70 , and sung to bolster flagging spirits during the war years			2
with its lyric describing the establishment of a new @entity65 in @entity59 , it has become @entity59 's most recognized patriotic song , sung as a religious hymn and a @entity80 national anthem at many sporting events			1
no less than three phrases from its 16 lines -- " green & pleasant land , " " dark satanic mills " and a " chariot of fire " -- have entered the national lexicon , and were referenced within the ceremony			2
the first provided the theme for the opening scene , which presented a vision of @entity59 as a pre-industrial rural idyll -- the type of bucolic setting in which @entity98 's @entity97 made their home			1
animals gambolled , workers tended the fields while a game of cricket took place on a village green , complete with a maypole -- a traditional focal point for community celebrations in @entity11 village life			2
in one area of the stadium was a mound resembling @entity115 , an historically significant hill in @entity117 identified with @entity118			2
the hill carries a link to the @entity65 theme , as @entity61 's poem is inspired by the " @entity122 " -- an apocryphal story that one of @entity126 ' relatives , @entity124 , had visited @entity115 and taken @entity126 there as a boy			1
@entity115 also has a more contemporary significance as the home of the @entity11 's most famous music festival			1
enter the " dark satanic mills " of the industrial revolution , which began in the @entity11 in the middle of the 18th century and swept throughout the rest of the world , transforming society and laying the foundations of the modern world in its wake			0
featured in the ceremony were representations of looms for manufacturing textiles and iron - making processes which played a key role in the revolution			0
the next , dreamlike sequence celebrated one of @entity11 's most beloved institutions , the @entity150 , while playing on its link to another celebrated icon			1
founded in 1948 , the @entity150 provides free healthcare , and has become the fifth largest employer in the world , with 1.7 million staff			0
many @entity11 are fiercely proud of the service and have fought to defend it from successive waves of reforms			0
the @entity150 was represented here by several wards ' worth of nurses pushing hospital beds , which were used as trampolines by children before being arranged to spell out the word : " @entity168			0
" coming in close proximity to a recitation from @entity182 's children 's classic @entity183 -- " when you play at it by day with the chairs and table - cloth , it is not in the least alarming , but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real " -- this was a clear reference to @entity168 , a @entity0 children 's hospital closely associated with that book			1
in 1929 , @entity182 gifted all the rights from the work to the hospital , claiming that @entity183 himself had been a patient there , and that " it was he who put me up to the little thing i did for the hospital			0
" @entity183 was not the only children 's literary character to feature in the segment , as a shower of @entity197 -- the magical @entity59 nanny who was the heroine of @entity200 ' book series -- blew in from above , to do battle with a towering character who resembled @entity14 , the main villain of @entity204 's @entity15 books ( @entity204 herself also appeared in the ceremony )			1
the heroes did n't all hail from the world of books			0
at one point a @entity210 appeared -- the classic two - door economy car first manufactured by the @entity213 in 1959			0
the next narrative segment was more modern and raucous , featuring a house party crashed by a horde of social networking teens			0
the attention also shifted to @entity11 's rich lineage of musical stars : @entity221 , @entity13 , the @entity222 , @entity223 and the @entity224 , among many others			2
the ceremony also made great play of the two great , inescapable constants of @entity11 life -- the weather , and the dry national humor			0
at one point in the proceedings , as a " storm cloud " broke and threatened to jeopardize the celebrations on stage , an audio clip familiar to many @entity11 was played			0
it contained the immortal words of veteran television weatherman @entity240 , best remembered for allegedly saying , hours before a killer 1987 storm : " apparently a lady rang the @entity244 and said she heard that there was a hurricane on the way			1
well , do n't worry , if you 're watching , there is n't			0
" in recent years , @entity240 has been at pains to point out that the @entity11 public has misremembered his role in the affair , saying he was n't working that day and that his infamous quote was actually made in relation to another storm			0
on any other day , he might resent the matter being revisited			0
but tonight he will surely manage a laugh at the unlikely way the bane of his career has placed him at center stage , in celebrated company , at @entity11 's biggest party .			1

@entity6 's @entity268 opening teemed with historic , literary and pop culture references
its title , ' @entity28 , ' was inspired by a line in @entity31 's " @entity30 "
it contained many references to the celebrated @entity61 poem " @entity65 "
but it 's not all *highbrow* : there was also a reference to a famous weatherman *blooper*
