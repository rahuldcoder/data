-- the nine @entity2 justices might be camera - shy , but a key federal appeals court is using its own technology to open up its most important proceedings to @entity7 viewers			1
the 9th @entity8 , based in @entity9 , has announced it will provide live streaming video for some of its oral arguments beginning monday			1
five appeals will be available online this week , beginning with a privacy case testing whether police can keep dna profiles of criminal suspects , even after charges have been dismissed			2
judicial officials say it is the first time a federal appeals court will use its equipment to offer live streams to the public , which can be accessed for free on the circuit 's website , ca9.uscourts.gov			1
media outlets , including @entity0 , have been allowed to record and air occasional high - profile appeals in the @entity32 and the @entity34 - based @entity33 in recent years			1
most other federal courts , including the @entity36 @entity2 , have banned photographs and video			1
" the 9th circuit has a long history of using advances in technology to make the court more accessible and transparent , " said chief judge @entity39			1
" video streaming is a way to open the court 's doors even wider so that more people can see and hear what transpires in the courtroom , particularly in regard to some of our most important cases			1
" under the new rules , all " en banc " oral arguments -- involving 11 judges sitting together in a courtroom at the @entity32 -- will be covered live through the court 's website			1
most such federal appeals are first heard by three - judge panels , and those hearings will not automatically be streamed live			2
the losing party at the three - judge stage can ask the court for wider en banc review , and typically involve matters of " exceptional importance			2
" the court estimates about 20 en banc cases each year will be streamed live			1
previous 9th @entity33 cases that were televised by the media involved @entity75 's same - sex marriage ban , electronic surveillance by the government , affirmative action and international terrorism			2
the largest and busiest appeals court all of circuit 's 11 courtrooms are equipped with video cameras , and broadcast and cable news outlets have been allowed to access the feeds			1
about 378 media requests for photographic and video coverage have been granted in the past two decades , said officials			2
among the 13 federal judicial circuits nationwide , the 9th is the largest and busiest , comprising of cases originating in @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity75 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , along with @entity101 and the @entity102			2
most appeals are heard at the @entity104 in @entity9			2
panels also convene occasionally in @entity106 , @entity75 ; @entity107 , @entity95 ; and @entity108			2
many at the 9th @entity109 for being a nationwide pioneer in bringing technology to improve public access in the courtroom and increase internal efficiency when managing a court 's docket			1
" the major innovations in court administration over the past 30 to 40 years , you 'll find most of them started through the creative mind of @entity124 , " said judge @entity117 , a longtime colleague who was a 2010 finalist for a @entity2 seat			1
" we had e-mail in the 9th circuit 20 years before anybody heard of the term , and this from a judge who has never been able to operate a computer			0
" @entity124 served on the circuit from 1961 until his death last year			0
he was chief judge from 1976 to 1988			0
the @entity135 , the third branch 's policymaking board , allowed federal courts of appeals in 1996 wide discretion to decide for themselves whether to allow cameras in its courtrooms			0
three years ago , a pilot program was extended to federal district , or trial , courts			0
fourteen such courts nationwide are participating , and nearly 150 civil proceedings are available to be viewed online			0
at almost 18,000 , the case with the highest viewership involved a 2012 civil trial where several citizens alleged government surveillance of their phone and computer activity			0
most federal courtrooms remain accessible for the public to watch in person , but seating can be limited			0
baby steps at the @entity36 @entity2 as for the highest court in the land , still no cameras , but incremental steps over the years to greater public access			1
audio of that week 's arguments are now posted fridays on the @entity2 's website			1
it may be the easiest to sample the flavor of public session : only about 330 courtroom seats are available to the public and only on a first - come , first - seated basis			0
a little - known fact about the high court is that it has been taping its arguments since 1955 , initially in secret			1
until three years ago , the audio from one term was not available until the beginning of the subsequent term , a wait of up to a year			0
and for decades , the only way to hear the reel - to - reel tapes was to go a @entity187 annex in @entity188 in person and listen on site			0
typically only scholars and researchers were allowed access			0
now all oral arguments from 2010 are easily available to listen or download on the website			1
earlier @entity2 cases are available on the website @entity198 , a digital archive run by professor @entity200 and the @entity201			2
but do n't expect to soon see justices @entity202 or @entity204 in their robes on @entity0 , mixing it up in the marble courtroom			0
despite congressional efforts to introduce cameras there , the justices warn of unintended consequences			0
" please , senator , do n't introduce into the dynamic that i have with my colleagues the insidious temptation to think one of my colleagues is trying to get a sound bite for television , " justice @entity213 told lawmakers in 2007			0
" we do n't want that			0
please do n't introduce this into our intercollegial deliberations			0

@entity32 @entity8 has been a technology leader
the court will provide live streaming video for some of its oral arguments
the @entity36 @entity2 has been *reluctant* to take such steps
