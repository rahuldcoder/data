@entity0 -- vice president @entity2 does n't typically leave much off the table			1
but , in a wide - ranging interview with @entity5 on @entity1 's " @entity6 , " he had more to say than we 've heard yet on everything from immigration and midterm elections to the most popular question of any political interview these days -- plans for 2016			1
here 's what we learned from the interview : @entity2 says presidential decision will come in summer 2015 1			1
a task force is n't just a task force : he 's the vice president in an administration resorting to executive action to keep itself relevant after what has become a long list of bruising losses since @entity26 lost their pull in @entity28 in 2010			1
when @entity5 asked @entity2 what could really come out of his new role as head of a jobs task force , he defended himself : " some of the stuff we did , major change came out			1
the @entity36 and a whole range of other things			0
" lackluster response , you say ? it 's easy to think back to the @entity42 -- where he rose with the president to grand applause as @entity46 said : " the families of @entity48 deserve a vote			1
" this , of course , followed by a @entity2 - led task force that was followed with , yes , a vote			1
but a vote that failed			0
so , what 's the point here ? this is something he thinks he can accomplish , is passionate about and will translate to voters			1
if anything , he is arguing that a vice president who has run twice for the presidency is not worth writing off -- just yet			0
@entity2 wants to give @entity65 a break : house speaker @entity65 may have come out putting the ax to immigration reform for this year , but @entity2 is n't ready to give up yet			1
@entity2 said @entity65 is " getting , understandably , not a criticism , a great deal of pressure from the right that wants no part of this			1
i think he 'll work his way through this			0
i still think we can get this done			0
it does n't take much time			0
" more importantly , he said the administration does n't want to " create more problems for @entity65			1
" inside politics : @entity65 says ' never mind ' on immigration " i think no matter what we said , it would impact the internal dynamic and politics in the @entity91 caucus			1
we should let them figure their caucus out , " the vice president said			0
so , whether he is a self - proclaimed optimist or just highly unrealistic , there 's an element here of understanding after what seems to be years of deadlock and impasse			0
but , does this leave enough room for @entity91 to come back to the table ? we 'll see			0
@entity2 still is the popular kid -- just maybe not on the campaign trail : @entity2 is completely aware that the president and some of his policies have seen some record unpopularity over the past few months			2
and , just as he and the president are set to address the @entity112 @entity26 retreat next week , he tells us exactly how big of a role they 'll play when it all comes down to the wire next fall			2
@entity2 to campaign for @entity118 @entity117 in tight @entity112 race " i 've been invited to go into well over 128 races so far			2
and so there are some places the president is considerably more popular than i am , but there 's some places where i can go in and the president ca n't , " he said			2
" there are some places where it makes no sense for me to go in or for the president to go in			0
" regardless , his shining optimism prevails : " i think we are in the best shape we can be , because the @entity136 public agrees with us on the issues			1
" source : @entity46 to stay away from some @entity140 races 4			2
@entity141 : what one might call a gaffe , others might call it a gift			0
@entity2 says what he feels , when he feels like it , at little expense			2
the best examples come from our interview and remarks he made preceding it			0
@entity2 said the " one overwhelming reason " not to run for president would be the chance to get back behind the wheel of his corvette : " i 'd like to get that @entity159 with 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds			2
" when @entity5 asked about the @entity156 comment , he said , " now you 've hit my sweet spot			0
" this , on top of calling @entity165 's @entity164 a " third world country " as part of the " embarrassing " and " stupid " infrastructure left in @entity136			1
he is treading a line that has become so critical to any politician repeatedly thrust into the spotlight			0
@entity2 : @entity172 like a ' third - world country ' so , what 's the cost ? everything he says could show up in an opponent 's campaign ads. then , what 's the gain ? no one said it better than @entity1 's @entity184 on " @entity6 " friday morning : " @entity2 is a @entity185 in politics for a reason -- he 's the gift that keeps on giving			1
" he went on to say , " love him or hate him , what you see is what you get			0
@entity2 wants to be president : last , and as noted above most important to the immediate news cycle and onward : @entity2 said he ca n't give a good reason not to run for president			1
there is no " obvious reason			0
" parsing @entity2 's words : if @entity201 runs , he wo n't but some would remind @entity2 of a couple : @entity201 is burying him in many of the most recent polls			1
@entity206 could haunt him in any future political endeavor to come			0
( yes , @entity2 -- health care is a @entity185 , but the @entity209 is still to be determined			2
) but we know one thing for sure -- summer 2015 is when we 'll get our answer			0
