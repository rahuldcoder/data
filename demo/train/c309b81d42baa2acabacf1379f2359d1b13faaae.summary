@entity0 -- it is up to the @entity3 to determine if there will be criminal charges in the release of classified military documents by @entity8 , but defense secretary @entity9 said sunday the website is morally guilty for putting lives at risk			1
on the @entity14 program " @entity15 , " @entity9 declared himself " mortified " and " appalled " over the public dissemination of 76,000 documents that detailed military operations in @entity19			2
" if i 'm angry it is because i believe this information puts those in @entity19 who have helped us at risk , " @entity9 said , citing a @entity21 statement that it would seek out informants and other collaborators exposed by the documents			1
he said the issue involved two areas of culpability - legal and moral			0
while the @entity3 will decide on the legal questions , " there 's also a moral culpability , and that 's where i think @entity8 is guilty , " @entity9 said			1
adm. @entity38 , the chairman of the @entity39 , also cited the @entity21 's threat to sources named in the leaked documents , saying the @entity43 had a " moral obligation " to protect their safety			2
however , neither @entity9 nor @entity38 , who appeared on both the @entity48 program " @entity51 " and the @entity50 program " @entity52 , " could cite a specific example of any @entity21 attacks based on information from the leaked materials			1
the public face of @entity8 , @entity58 , says the purpose of posting the leaked documents was to increase awareness of the realities of the war within the @entity43 public			2
gates , however , complained that there was no accountability for @entity8 in making public the documents presumably leaked by military personnel			1
@entity70 , is in custody as part of what officials call a widening investigation			0
@entity70 has already been charged with leaking a 2007 airstrike video and downloading documents from classified military systems			0
the documents posted last week are divided into more than 100 categories and touch on everything from the hunt for @entity85 leader @entity84 to @entity19 civilian deaths resulting from @entity43 military actions			0
thousands of pages of reports document attacks on @entity43 troops and their responses , relations between @entity43 in the field and their @entity19 allies , intramural squabbles among @entity19 civilians and security forces , and concerns about neighboring @entity101 's ties to the @entity21			0
according to @entity9 , an effort by the military to provide up - to - date information to the frontlines helped ease the ability of the documents to get leaked			2
" had whoever did this tried to do this at a rear headquarters overseas or pretty much anywhere here in the @entity43 , we had controls in place that would have allowed us to detect this , " @entity108 said			0
a change made for the wars in @entity120 and @entity19 to " put as much information as far forward as possible " made it " much easier to do in theater " than anywhere else			0
however , @entity9 said he believed the benefit to soldiers in the field of having updated information probably outweighs the risk of a single soldier or a few leaking classified material			1
" if one or a few members of the military did this , the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the frontline by denying them this information ... my bias is against that , " @entity9 said			1
" i want those kids out there to have all the information they can have			0

@entity9 and @entity38 say @entity8 did harm in posting classified documents
the @entity3 will decide on criminal charges , but @entity8 is morally guilty , @entity9 says
gates : the military provides updated information to frontline soldiers , raising the risk of leaks
