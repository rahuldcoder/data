" the letter stated that , as i ran through the tunnel , they were going to throw acid in my face			2
i was petrified and i probably never moved so much and so fast on a soccer field in my life			1
" @entity8 is one of football 's pioneers -- the first black player of the modern era to establish himself in @entity13 's top division			1
the reaction he faced from fans on the terraces more than 40 years ago was extreme , mirroring the strong resistance to immigrants landing on @entity20 's shores back then			2
recent incidents have shown that racism is still a big problem in these more multicultural times			1
world football 's president , @entity24 , infamously claimed last year that racism is not an issue on the pitch , but he has been proved sadly wrong			1
@entity13 , in particular , is dealing with the fallout of two high - profile player on player controversies			1
fans , meanwhile , have been arrested for racially abusing players at stadiums and on the @entity33			1
racial tension started growing in the @entity20 after @entity35 , when immigrants began pouring into the country from the @entity39 's colonies around the world -- notably the @entity41			1
the number of non-whites in @entity13 climbed from just a few thousand in 1945 to about 1.45 million in 1970			1
just two years before that , @entity45 politician @entity44 warned of " rivers of blood " because of increasing immigration			2
also in 1968 , @entity8 arrived from his native @entity50 to play for @entity52 club @entity51			2
" people were n't used to seeing people of color on the field in those days			2
i was always taught that you 're not playing for yourself , you 're playing for the people who are coming behind you , and that 's what kept me going , " @entity8 told @entity57			1
" there were certain things that were said and done , but you 've got to put them in them in the back of your mind and be strong and do what you have to do			2
" defining a country @entity8 's persistence in coping with the hate mail and the fan abuse -- some of it from his own club 's supporters -- helped paved the way for @entity76 , @entity13 's first black international			1
back in the 1920s , @entity52 - born @entity77 was denied the chance to represent his country due to his @entity82 parentage			2
at the time @entity84 football was very much a sport for the working class , largely played by the working class , and had been since the sport 's founding days in the 1860s			2
" as the game became more popular it was the beginning of the industrial revolution in @entity13 , " says @entity84 players ' union chief executive @entity90			1
" workers were attracted to the big cities and as a result all of the heavy industries , with steel and ship building and coal mining for example			2
workers had their saturday afternoons off and it became their recreation			2
" making history on november 29 , 1978 , @entity107 - born @entity76 stepped onto the hallowed turf of @entity13 's national stadium , @entity110 , to represent his country against the former @entity111 -- which , like its eastern @entity113 neighbors , has also had problems with racist factions at football matches			1
the @entity13 manager was @entity118 , who also brought @entity8 to @entity51			1
" to play for your country and for 100,000 people at home against the @entity123 , who had a good reputation then , you do n't want to let yourself down , let your parents down , let the people you know down , " @entity76 said			0
" the black thing never came into my head one bit			2
it was about being a professional footballer			0
" @entity76 won the @entity134 twice with @entity135 , but it was three men at another club , @entity138 , who really pushed black players into the spotlight in @entity13			1
raising the bar @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 were dubbed the " @entity153 " by their manager @entity146 after a visit to the club 's ground by the @entity152 female vocal group			0
" to see three black players on one team was very radical , " @entity143 recalls			1
" @entity138 fans were fantastic			0
they took to us fantastically , supported us , appreciated us			0
at the end of the day they want anybody out there to play football and to play football well			0
" @entity144 notes that @entity44 's political constituency was @entity165 and he delivered his infamous speech in @entity167 -- both cities being near neighbors to the trio 's adopted @entity171 town			0
" people said to me that as black players come to the fore in the early ' 70s , that was almost an opportunity for those racist groups -- the @entity178 , the @entity179 -- to come out and vent their fury at black players , " he told @entity57			1
" the football authorities did nothing about it , so for the black players coming through and particularly when i was at @entity138 , we would seem to get the brunt of it because there were three of us and the volume was quite astonishing at times			1
" it was n't pleasant			0
what it did to you was almost galvanize us , to say , ' this is our profession , this is our career			0
we 're not going to be driven away so we 'll see you next week , next month , next year , ' and that 's it , we get on with it			0
" targeting the trouble - makers @entity39 hooliganism reached arguably its worst levels in 1985 with the @entity202 disaster , which left 39 @entity204 fans dead after fighting broke out before the @entity134 final against @entity207			0
@entity84 clubs were banned from @entity113 competition for five years			0
that heralded a major government crackdown on football violence , and subsequent laws have made racist behavior illegal at matches			0
" the game was in danger of being written off , " @entity216 chief @entity90 says			0
" the prime minister , @entity219 , was thinking of insisting that people needed an @entity222 card to even go to a game			0
that 's how serious it was			0
" this season a @entity207 fan was arrested for racially abusing an opposing team 's player in an @entity230 match , and clubs have resorted to increasingly sophisticated security measures to catch offenders			0
trial by technology with closed - circuit television footage and stewards wearing head - mounted cameras , it is now much more difficult for spectators to misbehave at games			0
" they get football banning orders which are draconian , but they have a very strong effect , " says @entity243 , safety officer at second division club @entity244			0
" a person could be banned for three years from entering any @entity256 ground , they also have to hand in their passport , they 're not allowed to travel on the rail network when certain teams are playing , they 're not allowed to travel out of the country when @entity13 is playing			1
" it 's a very strict measure , but it is spelling out to these people that it is n't tolerated by anyone in football			0
we have 75 cameras based around the ground and should any racist abuse be reported to us we could very quickly potentially get one , two , maybe three cameras onto an area			2
" the way ahead @entity13 's @entity274 is now one of the most multicultural divisions in the world , attracting players from far and wide			1
but while many people believe that the situation -- in @entity13 at least -- has improved , campaigners such as ant - racism @entity279 group say there is still a lot of work to be done			1
" we want football in this country to be played , managed , administered and watched by the cross section of @entity13 , " says kick it out 's @entity289			1
" we do n't have that			0
we 've got no openly gay players , we 've got two black managers from 92 clubs ( now three following the appointment this week of @entity298 at lower league @entity299 ) , very few @entity301 players and a lack of women at boardroom levels			1
" so there 's an imbalance there and i think the work we do with all of the clubs and all of the agencies is try to address that in some way			0
" remembering what 's most important @entity207 's @entity314 has already served an eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity317 's @entity316 last october , while @entity319 's @entity318 has been stripped of the @entity13 captaincy ahead of a july court case in which he faces charges of similarly denigrating a black opponent			1
best , for one , hopes that the world 's most popular sport can focus on living up to its name -- " the beautiful game			0
" " i think the most important thing to remember about soccer , with all of the foolishness that is going on with the racism and stuff like that , the minute a goal is scored , i can be as black as the ace of spades or i can be as white as a snow flake ... the minute a goal is scored , everybody hugs one another			1
" the most important thing to remember is that the ball does n't care what color you are			0
