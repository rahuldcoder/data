-- in the horse race coverage of political campaigns , we sometimes forget that elections are just exciting preambles to the main event -- governing			0
now 's the time when the parties return to @entity9 and try to implement the people 's wishes as expressed in the election			1
and unlike 2008 and 2010 , neither party is likely to misinterpret the results as an ideological mandate			1
this is a good thing			0
but it 's also a mistake to read the election results as simply an endorsement of the status quo			1
despite the fact that @entity24 returned president @entity25 to office while keeping democrats in control of the @entity29 and @entity30 in charge of the @entity32 , this was no seal of approval on the political division we 've seen in @entity9 for four years			0
instead , it was a decided endorsement for balanced bipartisan plans			0
@entity25 won the election with a 16 - point margin among moderate voters			1
@entity30 @entity29 candidates who represented the ideological extremes of their party -- @entity44 and @entity45 , specifically -- were soundly rejected even in states that voted for @entity47 by double digits			1
polarizing voices such as rep. @entity50 were also retired from @entity51			1
the hate and hyper - partisanship that has disfigured our civic debates in recent years was decisively defeated in this election			1
an @entity58 poll by the center - right @entity59 found that 62 % of voters said that @entity9 needs leaders with " willingness to compromise to get things done			1
" this specifically extends to the looming " fiscal cliff " and " grand bargain " negotiations to deal with the deficit and debt			0
sixty - nine percent of @entity30 and 68 % of @entity27 chose balancing the budget over preventing tax increases as the bigger priority for the next @entity51			1
the broad outlines of a balanced bipartisan plan are well - known -- cut spending , change entitlements and raise revenue			2
that 's the ground defined by the @entity80 , the @entity81 and the @entity25 - @entity83 grand bargain			1
in all cases , the problem came to selling such a plan to right - wing republicans , who refused to consider any revenue increases , as well as left - wing democrats who do n't want to see long - term changes to entitlements			2
that 's why congressional members of the @entity80 such as @entity94 on the right and @entity96 on the left refused to support its recommendations , even while conservative and liberal senators such as @entity30 @entity101 and @entity103 @entity102 did			2
but according to the @entity106 survey , 54 % of @entity30 , 50 % of @entity27 and 49 % of swing voters support the @entity80 plan -- while just 10 % of @entity30 and 12 % of @entity27 oppose it			2
and despite the strenuous opposition by adherents to @entity111 's no - tax pledge , 35 % of @entity30 say they would be more likely to vote for a member of @entity51 who broke the anti-tax pledge to find a long - term solution to the deficit and debt mess -- while 31 % said it would make them less likely			1
all this should give members of @entity51 the courage to reach across the aisle , both in the upcoming lame - duck session and the next			1
house speaker @entity83 has indicated an openness to raising revenues from comprehensive tax reform that could actually lower rates but close loopholes			0
@entity83 is a deal maker who might feel unshackled from the @entity132 wing of his party if the president leads in a bipartisan manner			2
he set exactly the right tone after the election by saying , " let 's find the common ground that has eluded us			1
" the opportunity and obligation of @entity25 's second term will be to depolarize the nation and the @entity51			2
that will require leading on issues such as entitlements as part of a balanced plan to deal with the deficit and the debt			2
it seems possible that with the right bipartisan style and substance , the president can also achieve comprehensive immigration reform and some aspects of his jobs bill , such as a public - private infrastructure bank			1
republicans now realize that they can not antagonize the @entity162 community and win elections			0
president @entity164 tried to pass immigration reform co-sponsored by @entity166 and @entity167 in the @entity29 but was defeated by an outcry from the right in 2007			0
@entity25 could achieve that elusive goal by picking up that legislation again			0
the good news is that sens. @entity173 and @entity174 have said they are resuming their bipartisan talks on the matter			0
also , the president 's jobs bill , composed almost entirely of policies that had bipartisan support in the past , was dead on arrival in the last @entity51 for reasons little more profound than election - year hyper - partisanship			1
but with the economy slowly improving and the election over , there is little reason to prolong the painful charade			0
ideas such as a public - private infrastructure bank could boost employment while increasing the structural strength of our nation , a clear win - win while the @entity197 rebuilds from @entity198			0
best of all , it can be done with comparatively little cost to taxpayers by simply leveraging government investment with private funds , benefiting private employers rather than creating new bureaucracy			0
there will be stubborn hyper - partisans who refuse to work in good faith with the other party , pretending that their unwillingness to compromise is political courage			1
they are the problem in our politics , angry conformists who put partisanship ahead of patriotism and problem - solving			2
we have urgent problems to confront in our country			0
we have the capacity to solve them , and we know the broad path forward			0
what 's been missing is the political courage to stand up to the extremes in our own parties and reach across the aisle			1
that is specifically what voters want to see in our next @entity51 -- a spirit of constructive compromise and principled problem - solving that defines the common ground on any given issue and then builds on it			1
this is the time to redeem the promise @entity25 passionately articulated on @entity58 : " we are not as divided as our politics suggests			0
we 're not as cynical as the pundits believe			0
we are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states			0
we are , and forever will be , the @entity24			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity249 : election neither an ideological mandate for either party nor support for status quo
@entity249 : voters rejected hyper - partisanship and cast ballots for *collaboration* between parties
leaders have lacked the courage to stand up to extremes in their parties , he says
@entity249 : @entity51 ' task is to find common ground on issues such as jobs , budget , immigration
