@entity0 , @entity1 -- in its opening weekend , " @entity7 " scared and thrilled millions of moviegoers across the country			1
in " @entity7 , " @entity8 sees strange things happen in her old house			1
the film , which earned $ 23 million to finish no. 2 at the box office , emphasizes psychological horror over slasher film blood ' n ' gore , which its audience apparently appreciated			1
but @entity8 , who plays @entity17 in the film , confessed that , while filming , fear was not just reserved for the screen			1
" we all stayed in this big , old hotel which was kind of like the one in ' @entity23 , ' one of those turn - of - the - century big , old hotels , " @entity8 told @entity2			1
" i had a little chat with my room			0
i said , ' just out of respect , if there are any entities around , i need to stay here , i have a lot of work to do , i have to sleep at night , so please leave me alone			2
' " yet , @entity8 admitted , her belief in ghosts is not very strong			1
" i do have an attraction to paranormal investigation and all those kinds of shows but i 'm not sure if i really believe in ghosts , " she said			0
" @entity7 " is based on the true story of @entity17 , a mother who moves her family into an old house in @entity42 in order to be closer to the hospital where her son , @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , receives cancer treatment			1
the house was once a funeral home and , shortly after their move , the family begins witnessing strange , supernatural activities			0
" something very powerful and very real happened to this family			0
whether or not you believe it was some sort of demon or , you know , they 're manifesting it -- whatever it is -- it changed their lives , " @entity8 said			1
@entity8 , 47 , is probably best known for her @entity64 - nominated turn in " @entity65 " as @entity66 , the restaurant waitress who gets involved in a romance with the prickly writer played by @entity69			2
since that 2004 film , the actress has made several films , including " @entity73 " and " @entity74			2
" she and the rest of the cast developed a close relationship on the set and were much like a family behind the scenes			0
" i was more like a mother bear with my young actors , " @entity8 said			1
in fact , @entity8 added , her close relationship with the younger actors made filming difficult at times			2
" one scene in the movie that was the hardest for me to do was when [ @entity45 ] wakes up ... and his skin is all carved with these different incantations , " she said			0
" and i open his shirt and he 's just looking up at me with these big blue eyes with tears ... and he really felt like my boy , he really felt like my second son			0
" @entity8 said the film , complete with ghosts , s√©ances and creaking floorboards , is successful because it has all the elements of a good horror flick			1
" the movie works ... because it plays on our most basic childhood fears			0
' something 's under the bed , something 's in the closet , something 's in the mirror			0
' and all of us still have those same childhood terrors , " she said			0
the desire to experience those same terrors and to forget about everyday life , @entity8 added , draws people to the theaters at an older age			2
" i like things that go bump in the night , and scary things that are fun , " she said			1
" that 's really what this movie really is			0
i think horror movies are so popular because times are especially hard and i think a horror movie more than any other kind of movie is a true escape ... you 're forgetting about your life because you 're like , ' oh my @entity132 ! ' " @entity2 's @entity133 contributed to this story .			0
