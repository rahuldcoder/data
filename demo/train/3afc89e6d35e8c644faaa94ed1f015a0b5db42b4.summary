-- my name is @entity3 and i 'm a flirtaholic			2
as you 're reading this , i 'm probably flirting with some poor unsuspecting male -- a doorman , my doctor , a rock star			1
my come - hither - ness was first called out when i was 22			2
it was a gloriously sunny day in @entity9 and the male friend i was having coffee with leaned across the table and said , " you know , you 're an insatiable flirt			1
" " that 's ridiculous ! " i scoffed while batting my eyelids at him			2
flirting is a skill that might come quite naturally ( perhaps cringe - inducingly ) to some , yet a woman i recently met at a friend 's party introduced me to the idea that many people find flirting as terrifying as swimming with sharks			1
her name was @entity26 ; she smiled an awful lot , and she told me she was a dating coach who hosts " flirting parties " in @entity29			1
" go on , " i said with a raised eyebrow			2
many of her clients do n't know the first thing about breaking the ice with strangers they 're attracted to , she explained			1
they freeze , go mute , look at the floor or blurt out a depressing fact about hurricane devastation			0
@entity26 arranges outings for groups of five or so adults with the desire to boost their courting potential , takes them to a busy bar , gives them a pep talk , then forces them to approach attractive strangers and , well , get cutesy			1
this sounded like something i had to witness firsthand			0
and it made me wonder , if people are willing to pay experts to teach them to flirt ( $ 95 for one of @entity26 's two - hour flirting parties ) , what does that say about the role flirting plays in our lives ? is it just a bonus skill that 's nice to have , like being able to roll sushi or pole dance ? or is it a necessary function of bringing soul mates together ? the lost art of offline dating according to @entity71 , a dating and flirting coach and author of " @entity75 , " it 's a bit of both			1
" flirting allows you to meet someone you would ordinarily be too timid or terrified to approach , " she says			1
" no matter what the outcome , there is a sense of magic that occurs when you flirt			1
the more you flirt , the better you get and the more people you will bring into your life			1
" sadly , when i rocked up to @entity26 's flirting party in my flirtiest maternity dress , bitterly cold @entity91 temperatures had kept all but one of her clients away			1
but this was good news for the single lady , @entity100 , because with @entity26 all to herself , she 'd get more bang for her buck ( so to speak			1
) over drinks at an upscale pool hall , @entity26 prepped @entity100 with a recap of the do 's and don'ts : " it 's about having a natural smile , soft eyes " ... " make yourself available and approachable " ... " be complimentary ' ... " maintaining eye contact is key " ... " do n't be too quick to dismiss him if he says something weird " ... " keep the conversation light and breezy			1
" @entity100 , an artist in her 30s , nodded slowly , hanging on every word as though she was learning of a secret plot to end the world			0
@entity100 's main obstacle to being a pro flirter , @entity26 told me later , is her brain			1
" the people i work with tend to be very accomplished in their career , very intellectual , " she said			1
" but it really gets in the way of flirting because flirting is with your body , it 's not with your mind			1
" perhaps to emphasize that last point , @entity26 put @entity100 through one final exercise before we got to the practical portion of the evening : " who is your ideal hot guy ? " she asked			1
@entity139 , " @entity100 said			0
" and what would you say to him if he was standing right over there ? " after a couple of dud suggestions from @entity100 , @entity26 chimed in and threw out a bunch of icebreakers that might snag the attention of our current @entity147			1
" ok , let 's go meet some guys ! " @entity26 said , all gung - ho			1
not satisfied there were enough men at the pool hall , she led us across the street to another bar to find @entity139			0
to be clear , these parties are not about hooking up			0
nor are they about finding your future husband or wife			0
they 're all about getting practice			0
@entity164 is a journalist in his late 40s living in @entity91 who found the hands - on approach useful when he attended a flirting party just for dudes a couple of weeks ago			1
" basically , i 'm a successful guy , " he said			0
" but the notion of walking up to a woman i 've never met and striking up a conversation is paralyzing			1
imagine the terror you might feel if you had to give a speech to 10,000 people while wearing only your underwear			2
that terrifies me less than approaching a woman in public			0
what helps , @entity164 has learned , is to get that large pesky brain out of the way			0
how technology has changed romance " do n't think too much , " he says			0
" i can be paralyzed by , say , the fact that i do n't have the perfect opening line			0
... @entity26 preaches not thinking at that moment			1
you 've just got to plunge in and say something			2
" to be honest , i was n't sure @entity100 had the mustard to talk to a single guy in the bar , and i was starting to feel nervous for her			2
but when she emerged from the restroom , she 'd taken her long dark hair out of her ponytail , a definite step in the sexy direction			0
and with @entity26 at her side goading her , she suddenly picked a target and just went for it			1
( this was actually @entity100 's second flirting party , so she knew the drill			2
) " are you all here for a group function ? " she asked a man in his 40s who took an instant liking to her			0
they chatted for a while until @entity100 noticed he was wearing a wedding ring and gently extracted herself from the situation			0
later , as @entity100 made her way to the bar , flashing a warm smile was all it took for a tall , handsome guy sipping a glass of red wine to ask her which sport she was watching ( we were in a sports bar , because that 's where you go when you 're looking for bountiful testosterone )			0
the conversation that followed was promising			0
the handsome dude was from @entity231 , and @entity100 came up with all sorts of questions to keep things flowing			2
unfortunately , one of those questions was " do you have a green card ? " which as @entity26 pointed out later , did n't exactly fall under the " light and breezy " category			1
but it did n't matter			0
nor did it matter that she 'd be going home without a phone number or a date planned			0
@entity100 had achieved her goal ; she 'd put aside fear of rejection , fear of failure , fear of being boring , fear of being too short , tall , old , young , whatever , and had broken the ice with complete strangers			1
" i 'm really proud of you , " @entity26 said sincerely after a quick debrief			1
" you did really well tonight			0
" @entity100 looked exhausted but somewhat triumphant as she waved goodbye and headed for the subway			0
sure , flirting experts will tell you it 's possible to go from having no flirting skills whatsoever to becoming a flirting genius			2
@entity71 says she 's transformed people in 30 days			2
@entity26 contends that everyone has the ability to flirt ; it 's just a matter of accessing that ability and putting some muscle behind it			1
@entity271 , a busy finance executive in her mid- 40s , rated her flirting skills as one out of 10 before she started flexing her flirtimus to the maximus			2
" it was not something that i thought was important in meeting single men in my age range , " she said			0
" my thinking was if someone is interested they will speak to you			0
not the case , as i have learned			0
men need to know you are open , friendly and approachable			0
" for me it was a six - month process of learning this new skill and putting it to work in my life			2
but once you learn , you realize how easy and fun it really is			2
you have nothing to lose and all to gain			0
i can walk into a restaurant , a bar , a dry cleaners , a coffee shop and easily strike up a conversation with a potential adorable single guy			0
" scoff all you like at the idea of a dating coaches and the like			2
but at the end of the day , what they 're offering -- for a fee , granted -- is getting you one , two or three steps closer to life 's most potent and enduring resource : love			0
