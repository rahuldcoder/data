this year , high school students taking @entity4 @entity3 history in some parts of the country are getting a lesson in current affairs			1
the @entity10 , which creates standards for what knowledge students in @entity4 classes must demonstrate to get college credit for taking the course , introduced a new 95 - page framework that is causing controversy			1
not for what 's in it , but for what is left out			2
conservative school board members in several states say it 's biased and not patriotic enough			1
they complain that the new framework does not mention important facts and figures , like the rev. @entity27 or the @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity27 is mentioned in the guidelines , as are the @entity31 , but the woman who started the movement against the framework says it 's not about specific examples , but what she believes to be a liberal theme			1
the @entity10 , backed by many teachers , says that a framework does n't dictate curriculum , it only guides it			1
and that it 's absurd to conclude that teachers would n't teach such important issues as part of @entity3 history			1
proponents of the new framework argue it was written by professors and historians who are much more qualified to set standards than local school board members			1
each side is accusing the other of playing politics with @entity56			2
in several states , including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , conservatives have introduced proposals to revise the framework to include specific facts , and to make sure that it promotes @entity3 exceptionalism , or to withdraw funding from the @entity10			1
opinion : is @entity59 scared of @entity4 history ? " when you start omitting things , you 're censoring things , " said @entity73 , the @entity64 state board of education member who wrote the first piece of legislation against the framework			1
they had civil rights and @entity31 , but not @entity84			2
what 's left out smells of agenda			2
" in response , the @entity10 said , " in the face of these attacks ... @entity4 teachers and students , our member institutions , and the @entity3 people can rest assured : the @entity10 will not compromise the integrity of the @entity4			1
" nowhere has this caused more disturbance than in @entity99 , @entity100 , where high schoolers have been protesting the school board 's decision to establish a review committee for the new framework			1
some even walked out of school for several days in the fall			2
" this is wrong for @entity99 , this is wrong for us as students			2
this is wrong for @entity3 history , " one student said during public comment at an october school board meeting			1
" true patriotism ought to be based upon accurate understanding of @entity3 history , and not a biased promotion of @entity3 exceptionalism , " said another			1
conservative board member @entity121 wrote the @entity99 proposal , which states : " materials should promote citizenship , patriotism , essentials and benefits of the free enterprise system , respect for authority and respect for individual rights			1
materials should not encourage or condone civil disorder , social strife or disregard of the law			0
" " i was stunned that this resolution was even coming before the school board , " said board member @entity137			0
" it 's too extreme			0
it goes too far and i believe our students deserve an unvarnished view of history			1
" a revised proposal that did not include that strong language passed by a 3 - 2 vote			0
" i was insulted , " said @entity149 , who teaches the class at @entity151 in @entity99			0
" the thought that a board member that is supposed to represent an educational institution is assuming that history teachers in her district are going to lead kids to be un-american and unpatriotic			2
" the students protested again at the november meeting , reading aloud from their history textbooks			2
conservative board member @entity161 , who voted for the framework , said he believes it is the right of a local school board to review the curriculum of all classes students take			1
" you know , there is a national dialogue around @entity4 @entity3 history and a lot of concerns have been raised about the balance in that curriculum , " @entity161 said			1
when pressed , he could not give specific examples of his concerns , and said only that he wanted a review of it			0
@entity121 refused multiple requests to talk to @entity0			0
" in my opinion we need to teach the good , the bad and the ugly , " said @entity181 , the other board member who voted against it			0
" we need to make sure our kids understand what it is like to be an @entity3			0
" the @entity10 has responded to this by defending the framework , but also allowing public comment through february			1
the discussion is expected to pick up again in the summer			0
in a statement , it said , " in the face of these attacks ... @entity4 teachers and students , our member institutions , and the @entity3 people can rest assured : the @entity10 will not compromise the integrity of the @entity4			1
" the furor began with @entity203 , a college test prep instructor and former @entity4 history teacher			1
when the @entity10 made public the new framework and announced it would replace an older five - page version starting this year , @entity203 connected with @entity208 , a senior fellow at the conservative think tank @entity209			1
" there was a relentless negative drumbeat about @entity3 , all of the themes all of the concepts			0
" @entity215 , a leader of the effort against the new framework , said it gives special emphasis to race , gender and ethnic identities			2
" that is sort of the leftist goal , having all of history viewed through that lens , " she said			2
together , @entity215 and @entity203 penned an op - ed that barely anyone noticed until @entity215 was giving a speech in @entity64 and mentioned @entity203 's complaint			0
" there was a member of the @entity234 in audience -- @entity73 , " @entity215 said			0
" he came up and expressed concern and asked what could be done			0
that led to the resolution he introduced			0
" @entity73 then wrote a resolution that included language so strong that it was noticed by the @entity242			0
the framework , he wrote , " reflects a view of @entity3 history that is critical of @entity3 exceptionalism , the free enterprise system and emphasizes negative aspects of our nation 's history while minimizing positive aspects			1
" an @entity242 talking points memo followed , and ripped the phrase straight from @entity73 's resolution , adding to it a request that " @entity258 withhold any federal funding to the @entity10 ( a private nongovernmental organization ) until the @entity261 course and examination have been rewritten in a transparent manner to accurately reflect @entity3 history without a political bias			1
" from there , it trickled down to local school boards			0
resolutions with many of the exact same phrases as the @entity242 memo appeared in places such as @entity61 and @entity62			0
" in the past it was five pages , a list of what teachers are supposed to go over , " said @entity64 state board chairwoman @entity274			0
" now it 's 98 pages , it 's detailed			0
me , i 'm a former teacher			0
to me it looked more like a curriculum			2
" in other states , the issue has not been as disruptive			2
it was most recently raised in @entity60 and @entity59			0
the language from a resolution introduced by @entity242 @entity60 state sen. @entity291 mirrors the @entity242 memo nearly word - for - word , as many state resolutions do			0
in @entity59 , a bill passed an education committee that would have eliminated state funding for @entity4 @entity3 history classes unless the @entity10 changed the framework			1
but after an outcry , the bill 's sponsor said he 'd rewrite the legislation and change the wording			0
in @entity62 , there is concern the new framework does n't meet state standards for what should be taught , state rep. @entity305 told @entity0			2
" we insist on the study of our founding principles , " he said			0
" we 're either going to require them to take a course before @entity261 , or find another way , but we 're pretty stubborn about it			0
" but when a local school board in @entity320 , @entity62 , asked the state board of education not to implement the new framework , it raised concerns that students there might lose out on the opportunity to get college credit			2
the chairman of the state board , @entity329 , told @entity0 that they are in a " listening and discussing stage			0
" " we 're not ready to do anything , " @entity329 said			0
" i want what 's best for the children and students of @entity62 , and i certainly do n't want them to lose any opportunity to take @entity4 history			1
" in @entity64 , where it began , teachers are being told to " fill in " the framework with state - issued curriculum standards for @entity3 history , @entity341 said , adamant that it would not affect the college credits that students can get for taking the class			1
" it 's too important			0
those @entity4 courses are really critical for ( grade - point average ) and college scholarships , " @entity274 said			1
the @entity353 in @entity354 , @entity61 , introduced a resolution that mirrored the @entity242 memo , and @entity234 member @entity357 wrote in a blog post dated october 30 that the board is " currently studying the issue , " and " we should take a stand against any attempt to nationalize or circumvent state standards and local control , " he wrote			0
in @entity63 , legislation was introduced in november that would create a commission to examine any new @entity4 framework from the @entity10			1
" the real controversy is the wording in the key concepts of this framework			2
until the @entity10 revises that wording and bias in there , this issue is not going to die down , " @entity274 said			1
@entity0 's @entity375 contributed to this report .			0

several states debating new framework for @entity4 history instruction
conservatives say it is biased
