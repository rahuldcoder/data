@entity14 consumer affairs minister @entity62 said thursday that the @entity14 firm @entity63 should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse			1
@entity63 was the first company to label the meat as beef , the minister said , adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months			1
@entity63 should have identified the meat as horse from its @entity71 customs code , as well as its appearance , smell and price , he said			1

what 's behind the horse meat contamination scandal ? @entity134 is not allowed to enter the human food chain			1
the drug is no longer approved for human use in the @entity138 , the @entity140 website says , because " some patients treated with phenylbutazone have experienced severe toxic reactions			0
" the drug can cause various blood conditions and is a carcinogen , the @entity140 says			0

it is also prescribed to some patients who are suffering from a severe form of arthritis , " @entity156 added			0
@entity3 authorities raid slaughterhouse over horse meat scandal " at the levels of bute that have been found , a person would have to eat 500 to 600 burgers a day that are 100 % horse meat to get close to consuming a human 's daily dose			1
and it passes through the system fairly quickly , so it is unlikely to build up in our bodies , " she explained			0

fellow supermarket chains @entity180 and @entity182 said they are examining certain beef products as a precaution			0
