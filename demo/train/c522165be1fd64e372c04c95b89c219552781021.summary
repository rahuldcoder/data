@entity0 the men and women of the 114th @entity4 , despite being bitterly divided and partisan , almost universally share one thing in common : their faith			1
nearly 92 % of @entity4 -- or 491 of the 535 members -- identifies as @entity9 , according to a study by @entity12 's @entity11			1
that number is slightly up from 90 % in the 113th @entity4 and continues a trend where the percentage of @entity9 and @entity16 in @entity4 outpaces their national average			1
though @entity9 dominate both parties , @entity18 are more religiously diverse than @entity20			2
of the 301 republicans in the 114th @entity4 , @entity16 freshman rep. @entity21 of @entity22 is the only non-christian			1

but unlike @entity20 , @entity18 in @entity4 are 12 % @entity16 and have two @entity28 , two muslims , one @entity30 and one unaffiliated member			1
" you could say that the religious diversity in @entity4 is concentrated on the @entity18 side , " said @entity32 , director of religious research at @entity12			2
" the vast majority of the @entity16 , all of the @entity29 , @entity37 and @entity30 in @entity4 and the one unaffiliated member are all on the @entity18 side			1
" @entity4 , the most representative and responsive branch of the federal government , has seen some aspects of their religious affiliation mirror nationwide trends			0

only 3 % of the 87th @entity4 ( 1961 - 1962 ) , according to @entity12 , was non-christian			2

@entity32 said the under representation of unaffiliated @entity63 might be a political decision by members of @entity4			0
