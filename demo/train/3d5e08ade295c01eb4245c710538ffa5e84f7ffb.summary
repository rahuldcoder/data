-- this was not in the script			0
in a season where @entity4 has appeared irrepressible at times , a 1 - 1 draw against relegation - threatened @entity7 was not what manager @entity8 might have anticipated			1
a ninth minute injury to @entity10 , making him doubtful for this weekend 's game against @entity12 and perhaps even the @entity14 final , merely rubbed salt into the wounds			2
@entity10 appeared to leave the field as a precautionary measure with a hamstring strain before his teammates were forced to settle for a frustrating point against a resilient @entity7			1
the result leaves real four points adrift of leader @entity24 , who face @entity27 on sunday before a final day showdown with @entity29			1
" it is practically gone now but while there is a mathematical chance then @entity4 are obliged to keep going , " goalscorer @entity30 told reporters			1
" it has been a long season and it takes its toll on the body			0
" we wasted a unique opportunity and we will now have to examine it calmly			0
with 10 minutes to go we relaxed , and against a side battling for survival , they are always going to make it difficult for you , " the title is now surely between leader @entity24 and second place @entity29			1
should @entity29 defeat @entity50 , it will need to see off @entity24 at @entity51 to claim the title			0
@entity4 , which began the contest without the injured @entity54 , adjusted to the loss of @entity10 and moved ahead 10 minutes before the break			1
@entity30 , who has scored five goals in his past four games , unleashed a fine free - kick from 25 - yards which flew into the net			2
the home side , which has struggled throughout the season for goals , improved after the interval and slowly took the initiative			0
and it came as little surprise when @entity69 headed home @entity71 's corner with five minutes of normal time remaining			2
the loss of @entity10 , who has scored 31 league goals this season and 50 in all competitions , will be of greatest concern to @entity8			0
@entity4 faces @entity24 in the @entity14 final on may 24 in @entity78 and will be keeping a close eye on the @entity81 midfielder over the next week			2
@entity83 's side , which takes on @entity12 in its next match , finishes the campaign at home to @entity87 on may 18 .			0
