@entity0 -- @entity3 's longest war			1
an alphabet soup of new government departments and agencies			0
long security lines at airports			0
all those things happened in response to the 9/11 @entity14 attacks on @entity15 and the @entity16 that forever changed @entity3 security perceptions and practices			1
now a commission created to examine what happened then says we need to do more now to protect ourselves			2
read the @entity23 's new report " the ' generational struggle ' against terrorism described in ' the @entity29 ' is far from over , " the panel said this week in reference to its assessment a decade earlier			1
" rather , it is entering a new and dangerous phase , and @entity3 can not afford to let down its guard			1
" its bottom line assessment ? " strenuous counterterrorism efforts will remain a fact of our national life for the foreseeable future			1
" here is a look at the report , analyzing what has worked , what has n't and has to happen now			1
what worked going after @entity14 's leadership the immediate reaction to the hijack attacks that toppled the @entity49 towers and damaged the @entity16 targeted the culprit -- the @entity14 network of @entity52 operating out of @entity53 near the @entity55 border			2
years of war in @entity53 ended the safe haven there for terrorists and achieved the goal of degrading @entity14 's core , the report said			1
@entity3 special forces eventually killed @entity52 in @entity55			1
air travel security long security lines , reinforced cockpit doors , removing laptops from carry - on bags , no liquids , checking shoes -- all followed the attacks that killed 3,000 people			2
a no - fly list that had 16 names before the attacks now has more than 1,000 , the report noted			1
so far , no similar foreign attack has occurred in @entity3			1
the closest call came in 2009 when @entity79 failed to ignite an explosive in his underwear as a @entity83 jet from @entity84 approached @entity85 on christmas day			0
the director of @entity89 and the @entity90			0
the @entity92 and the military 's @entity93			0
all exist in response to the 9/11 attacks as part of an unprecedented expansion and reorganization of government security resources			1
" these measures have largely succeeded , " the report said			2
" the mass - casualty attacks many feared in the wake of 9/11 did not materialize			1
today , in large part because of these many reforms , the @entity3 is a much harder target			1
" @entity5 surveillance the security apparatus also expanded its ability to track telephone and computer communications after 9/11			2
former @entity5 contractor @entity114 leaked classified details of those programs last year , revealing they were much broader and potentially intrusive than publicly known			0
a resulting backlash at home and abroad caused the @entity122 administration to make some changes without substantively changing the ability to monitor suspect communications			0
" we believe these programs are worth preserving , albeit with additional oversight , " the report said			2
the @entity3 spirit the @entity132 went on as scheduled this spring , undeterred by the terrorist bombings at the finish line a year earlier , the 9/11 commissioners noted			1
" this year 's triumphant marathon sent an unmistakable message to the world : @entity3 will not bend to terrorism , " the report said , adding that " the country must continue to prepare for the unforeseen , but it appears to be moving in the right direction			1
" what has n't worked full disclosure the new report 's biggest takeaway ? tell the people what they need to know			1
prior to the 9/11 attacks , " the government did not effectively explain to the public the evil that was stalking us , " it said			2
" we fear that this is happening again			0
" on major issues of the day -- a transformed and resurging @entity14 , the growing terrorist haven spawned by the @entity161 conflict , increasing cyber threats -- " public awareness lags behind official @entity0 's , " it said			1
" if this gap persists , the political support for needed national security capabilities will fade , " the report continued			0
" in today 's very dangerous world , that is something we can ill afford			0
" efforts to reduce @entity173 extremism @entity173 extremism has increased in the past decade , the report said			2
" while @entity14 's various affiliates are enmeshed in their own local conflicts , hatred of the @entity3 remains a common thread , " it added , citing the emergence of groups such as @entity178 , the @entity179 and @entity161 , @entity180 and @entity181			2
" partly , this is a consequence of the @entity188 and the power vacuums and ungoverned spaces that have sprung up in its wake , " it said			0
" partly , it is the result of @entity3 's inability or reluctance to exert power and influence in a number of places			2
" in particular , the commissioners noted their 2004 report on the 9/11 attacks said that if @entity209 became a failed state , " it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against @entity3 at home			1
" today , the @entity179 controls vast territory in those countries , creating " a massive terrorist sanctuary , " the latest report said			2
a @entity216 official warned a congressional committee on wednesday that " @entity179 is @entity14			0
" " it may have changed its name , it may have broken with senior @entity14 leadership such as @entity223 , but it is @entity14 in its doctrine , ambition and increasingly in its threat to @entity3 interests , " said @entity218 , the deputy assistant secretary for @entity209 and @entity219			1
" in fact it is worse than @entity14			0
" @entity230 not surprisingly , a dysfunctional @entity230 with some of the lowest approval ratings also gets cited by the 9/11 commissioners			0
the funding process for national security is fragmented , with multiple budget categories providing the money			0
in addition , the @entity87 reports to more than 90 congressional committees and subcommittees			0
" while the executive branch has undergone historic change and institutional reform , @entity230 has proved deeply resistant to needed change , " the report said			0
" it has made some minor adjustments , but not the necessary structural changes in oversight and appropriations for homeland security and intelligence			0
" @entity252 prepare better for cyber attacks according to the report , readiness to deal with cyber attacks " lags far behind the threat			1
" the commissioners noted the issue got little mention in their 2004 report , but now represents a constant and growing concern			0
" one lesson of the 9/11 story is that , as a nation , @entity3 did not awaken to the gravity of the terrorist threat until it was too late , " the report said			1
" history may be repeating itself in the cyber realm			0
" it called for government leaders to " describe to the @entity3 people , in terms as specific as possible , the nature of the threat and the tools they need to combat it			1
" " a growing chorus of senior national security officials describes the cyber domain as the battlefield of the future , " the report said			2
" yet @entity230 has been unable to pass basic cybersecurity legislation , despite repeated attempts			0
" use of military powers after 2001 , @entity230 authorized the use of military forces against terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks			2
it remains the legislative permission slip today			0
the report said the authorization needs updating , calling on the administration to " clearly explain whether it needs new legal authority to confront threats like @entity179 and how far , in its view , any new authority should extend			0
" better oversight streamline the system so that the @entity5 and the @entity87 have more clear and direct oversight , the report recommended			0
" if @entity230 is not effectively overseeing these programs , no one is , " the report said			0
vigilance the biggest threat to @entity3 is failing to recognize the threat still exists and is growing			1
" many @entity3 think that the terrorist threat is waningâ € ” that , as a country , we can begin turning back to other concerns , " the report said			1
" the threat remains " grave , " it continued , warning " we can not afford to be complacentâ € ” vigorous counterterrorism efforts are as important as ever			1
" in particular , the report said , " young @entity3 need to know that terrorism is not going away			1
" @entity1 's @entity321 and @entity322 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 do n't realize the terrorist threat they face , a new report says
get used to " strenuous counterterrorism efforts , " the 9/11 commission says
it issued a new assessment 10 years after its report on the 9/11 terrorist attacks
cyber attacks have become a major threat , the new report says
