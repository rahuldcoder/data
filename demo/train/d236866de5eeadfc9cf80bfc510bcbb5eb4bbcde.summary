-- the world 's first stem cell burger was cooked and eaten in @entity3 today			1
the brainchild of @entity7 's @entity6 , the burger was made of 20,000 small strands of meat grown from a cow 's muscle cells and took three months to create			1
breadcrumbs and some egg powder were added to the cultured beef to make it taste like a normal beef burger			1
to give it a beefy color , red beet juice and saffron were added			0
chef @entity21 fried the stem cell burger with sunflower oil and butter and remarked that it looked slightly paler than a traditional burger			1

after having the first bite and chewing thoughtfully many times , @entity34 , an @entity36 food trends researcher , said : " i expected the texture to be more soft -- it 's not that juicy			2
it 's close to meat but it misses salt and pepper			1
" the second volunteer to taste it agreed that the burger was missing something			2
@entity51 , a @entity52 - based author who writes about the future of food , said : " it has a familiar mouth - feel to real meat			2
