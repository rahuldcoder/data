@entity0 -- call it an amazing example of entrepreneurship or a daring play of deceit			0
after a @entity10 - based " critical infrastructure " company discovered in 2012 its computer systems were being accessed from @entity13 , its security personnel caught the culprit ultimately responsible : not a hacker from the @entity13 but one of the company 's own employees sitting right at his desk in the @entity10			1
the software developer is simply referred to as " @entity21 , " according to a case study by the @entity10 telecommunications firm @entity23			2
@entity21 was an " inoffensive and quiet " programmer in his mid- 40 's , according to his employee profile , with " a relatively long tenure with the company " and " someone you would n't look at twice in an elevator			1
" those innocuous traits led investigators to initially believe the computer access from @entity13 using @entity21 's credentials was unauthorized -- and that some form of malware was sidestepping strong two - factor authentication that included a token @entity38 key fob under @entity21 's name			1
investigators then discovered @entity21 had " physically fedexed his @entity38 token to @entity13 so that the third - party contractor could log - in under his credentials during the workday , " wrote @entity47 , a senior forensic investigator for @entity23			1
@entity21 had hired a programming firm in the northeastern @entity13 city of @entity51 to do his work			2
his helpers half a world away worked overnight on a schedule imitating an average 9 - to - 5 workday in the @entity10			0

and over the past several years , @entity21 received excellent performance reviews of his " clean , well written " coding			0

" a forensic image of @entity21 's workstation revealed his true work habits and typical day : 9:00 a.m. -- get to work , surf @entity65 , watch cat videos 11:30 a.m. -- lunch 1:00 p.m. -- @entity68 2:00 p.m or so -- @entity69 and @entity70 4:30 p.m. -- send end - of - day e-mail update to management 5:00 p.m. -- go home the @entity23 investigation suggested @entity21 's entrepreneurial outsourcing spirit stretched across several companies in his area -- netting him several hundred thousand dollars a year as he paid out about $ 50,000 a year to his @entity13 - based ghost writers , according to hundreds of @entity80 invoices also discovered on his work computer			1
@entity23 's @entity82 told @entity1 via e-mail that @entity21 " was in fact terminated at the conclusion of the investigation			0
" presumably @entity21 's @entity13 helpers were as well .			2
