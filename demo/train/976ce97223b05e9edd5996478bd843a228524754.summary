-- like @entity2 or @entity3 , the @entity1 is a robot in disguise			1
sure , the @entity1 looks like it 's just a massive , industrial - styled phone , just like our favorite @entity6 looked like nothing other than a badass eighteen - wheeler			1
but the @entity1 can also change into a laptop , a desktop workstation , and other things which are decidedly un-phone - like			1
we 've been waiting to see a finished version of this phone since @entity14 first showed off the @entity1 in january			1
though it was supposed to launch months ago on @entity18 's @entity17 network , @entity15 sent the phone back to the drawing board for improvements ( ostensibly to better stack up against @entity23 's @entity17 offering , the @entity24 )			1
the phone came back as a connectivity beast with lots of optional peripheral attachments , turning the @entity1 into a successor of sorts to the @entity31 , @entity14 's most recent dual - core , peripheral - enhanced handheld			1
@entity15 's premise is simple : our phones are increasingly becoming more powerful , useful and versatile in our everyday lives			1
why not allow them to adapt — or transform , if you will — to what we need them to be in different situations ? the " @entity43 , " for instance , is literally a laptop shell driven by the @entity1			1
after plugging the phone into the station on the back hinge , the @entity1 launches @entity14 's " webtop " interface , which is essentially a desktop - lite environment powered by the phone 's hardware			1
there 's a catch to all of this connectivity , however : you 'll have to pony up a lot of dough			2
the @entity43 accessory will run you $ 300 , while the hd station — which gives you access to the same interface but lets you use your own keyboard , mouse and display — costs a c - note			1
add a car charger , @entity68 mini-display adaptor and navigation dock to that , and you 're closing in on $ 1000			0
that 's a hell of a lot of money to spend on tricking out your phone , even if it 's no longer just a phone once you plug these things in			1
of course , you do n't have to buy an accessory to get a good experience out of a @entity1			1
but it somewhat misses the point if you do n't			0
the draw of the device is in its shape - shifting capacity , a re-imagination of what a smartphone should be able to do			1
otherwise , you 'd probably be better off going with a similarly spec 'd phone for a lower starting price — and those are definitely out there			2
conceptually , ultra-connectivity is brilliant			0
with the @entity31 and the @entity1 , @entity14 is trying to hard to differentiate from the existing glut of @entity97 smartphones on the market			1
execution , however , leaves much to be desired			2
casual browsing on the @entity43 was wonky , stutter - filled and nothing like cruising the web on my tried - and - true laptop			1
the keys on the board were chintzy and small , most likely a casualty of keeping the cost of the peripheral below $ 300 ( unlike the launch price of the @entity31 's lapdock , which was a hefty $ 500 )			2
desktop simulation on an hdtv through a webtop dock was a little less jerky , but still subpar			0
it takes some beef to run all the peripherals , and the handset itself is no slouch			0
under the hood , this bad boy is packing more power than a @entity124			0
it 's running on a dual - core 1ghz chip backed by a gigabyte of @entity127 , @entity128 of internal storage plus a microsd card slot			2
it ships with a 16gb card , but it can accept a card up to @entity135			0
swiping through menu screens was snappier than most of the other phone i 've tried this year — it 's definitely one of the most responsive phones you can buy			2
my gaming experience on resource - heavy apps like @entity146 hd was excellent			2
given all the brawn , the @entity1 requires a lot of juice to keep it running — and it certainly shows			2
after starting my day with a fully - charged phone , my battery was dead before the end of the workday			1
that 's after moderate - to - heavy use			2
i made a few phone calls , used my data connection liberally , and pumped the screen brightness up to full blast ( the display , by the way , is n't the sharpest i 've seen )			0
this is how we all use our phones , so i expected better battery performance			0
the real battery suck comes from the @entity17 radio			0
leave your @entity17 turned on all day and you 'll be dead before nightfall			0
use your high - speed connectivity judiciously , however , and you may make it to midnight or beyond , even under normal use conditions			0
it 's sad that we have to ration our own bandwidth use , but alas , that 's the name of the game with today 's devices			0
thankfully , using @entity18 's @entity180 at full tilt is worth the energy drain			0
our average download speeds clocked in around 10 mbps in the @entity184 on average , with upload speeds ranging from 4 to 6 mbps			0
in short , the handset itself is speedy , powerful and — battery life aside — has all the stuff you want in a high - end smartphone			1
but so do four or five other @entity97 options currently on the market			0
unfortunately , the extra products that were supposed to tip the scales in the @entity1 's favor end up falling far short of their potential			1
wired : power , speed and connectivity options are damn near unrivaled in the mobile space			0
android 2.3.4 gingerbread is current , and well - skinned			0
@entity68 , expandable @entity206 , @entity207 , oh my ! tired : unless you 're a baller , dropping this much coin on the @entity1 and its accessories might leave you eating ramen noodles for a month			1
peripherals do n't live up to their potential			0

@entity1 is a massive smartphone that can also work as a laptop , work station
the phone 's shape - shifting ability re-imagines what a smartphone is *designed* to do
accessories are *expensive* and , sometimes , their *integration* with the phone is wonky
the *bionic* is powerful , but its battery life leaves something to be desired
