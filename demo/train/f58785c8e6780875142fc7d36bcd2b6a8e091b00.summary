-- in a bookstore , i saw a woman taking photograph after photograph of newly released titles that were arranged on a shelf			0
she was using her phone to take the pictures			1
why would anyone want to take pictures of books ? then , at a restaurant , waiting for a table , i heard two men , also waiting , talking			1
one said he had just ended a frustrating day at the store he owned			2
" do they think i 'm a showroom ? " he said			2
he mentioned people who had come into his shop that day , had looked at the merchandise , had taken notes -- and then had left			2
" do they think i do n't know what they 're doing ? " he said			0
it is a relatively new phenomenon			0
among retail merchants -- owners of stores both small and large -- it has a name : " showrooming			1
" no one showrooms by choice			0
and it represents a potential sea change in @entity36 life			0
as described in an article by reporter @entity39 in the @entity40 , showrooming is " when shoppers come into a store to see a product in person , only to buy it from a rival online , frequently at a lower price			1
" say a merchant owns a retail store -- a brick - and - mortar store , on a city street			1
he or she hires staff , pays rent , writes checks for electricity and telephone service , pays for janitorial work , pays real estate and sales taxes , invests heavily in merchandise			0
and hopes against hope that customers will come in , look around and buy something			2
this is how the retail sales business has always worked			0
but in recent years , as online companies without a single physical store have risen to prominence , something new has occurred			1
people will come into stores , look around , stop at items they particularly like -- and instead of carrying them to the cash register , will take photos of them , or type a description into their smartphones			2
then , in many cases , they will go home , enter the product into a search engine and find some online - only merchant -- a merchant who has no real - life stores -- who is selling the item for less money			1
a tap of the " enter " key , a few keystrokes to provide credit card information , and the item -- the item the person has examined and liked in the brick - and - mortar store -- is on its way to the buyer 's home			1
it 's all so effortless			0
who loses ? you know the answer			0
the loser is the owner of that real - life store : the person who has stocked the merchandise , hired the staff , paid to keep the store cool in summer and warm in winter , written the rent checks and the tax checks			2
it is no wonder merchants are feeling frustration and anger that their stores are being considered as little more than showrooms by some shoppers -- showrooms displaying merchandise that , if the people wandering the aisles go home and buy from an online vendor , will provide not a cent in revenue to the owner of the real store			1
do the customers ever look into the eyes of the proprietor of the store and wonder if this new way is fair to him ? as @entity140 of @entity141 has written : " most consumers do n't really care how , or even if , a retailer makes money			2
all they care about is which one has the best products at the cheapest prices			0
the ideal situation is one in which they can inspect merchandise in person , and then buy it at the cheapest price without having to schlep it to and from the car , and without having to pay extra for delivery			2
" what 's the difference , you may ask ? why does this matter ? it will matter when and if critical mass is reached , and online - only merchants , who do n't have to underwrite the expense of having traditional stores on city streets , reach dominance			1
then , one by one , the stores that have unwillingly become showrooms for the online merchants will fold up			1
and the @entity36 downtown - and - mall landscape will begin to look barren			0
a doomsday scenario ? perhaps			0
but " just browsing " has taken on a different meaning in the context of shoppers who go home and use their computers ' browsers to find online retailers who will undercut the conventional stores			1
last weekend i was in central @entity184 for the annual charity race we hold to raise cancer - research money in memory of my late friend @entity189			0
i asked his daughter , @entity190 , who owns a women 's boutique called @entity193 , whether she was familiar with the showrooming phenomenon			1
she said she has seen it with her own eyes , in her own store			2
" if they tell you how much they like an item , and take a picture of it and then leave the store and you never hear from them again , it 's a pretty good indication that they may be going home and looking for a better price online , " she said			1
" and if they call the store later and ask you to tell them the specific style name and number of the item -- then you really know			1
they 're putting the merchandise they saw in your store into a search engine			0
" it 's not just smaller merchants like @entity189			0
@entity223 , the retail - store giant , wrote a letter to its vendors this year that said , " what we are n't willing to do is let online - only retailers use our brick - and - mortar stores as a showroom for their products and undercut our prices without making investments , as we do , to proudly display your brands			1
" what all this will eventually do to old - style stores is anyone 's guess			0
perhaps they will be judged to have outlived their usefulness			0
in the meantime , merchants will continue to open their doors each morning in the hopes that the people who come in will really intend to buy something			1
there is a longstanding axiom that business owners are supposed to believe in : " the customer is always right			0
" but in this emerging era in which people come into stores taking photos and making lists , with no intention to give the store owner their business , worried merchants ca n't be blamed if they look around their shops and ask themselves : who , and what , is a customer ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			1

@entity269 : a new practice called ' " showrooming " a *threat* to brick and mortar businesses
he says shoppers take pictures of an item , or make notes , and then buy the item online instead
he says running a store *costly* , how can merchants compete if shoppers " showroom ? "
@entity269 : even big stores , like @entity223 , worry . @entity291 may lead to stores ' *demise*
