-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 and opposition leader @entity3 moved their only televised election debate so they would n't clash with the finale of " @entity8 " sunday -- but their switch forced @entity10 to change her schedule			1
the politicians did n't want to go up against the cooking showdown , @entity2 's most popular program , so they started their debate an hour earlier than tradition dictates			1
that should have put them up against " @entity19 , " where @entity10 was scheduled to make a guest appearance , @entity2 's @entity17 reported			1
the @entity2 pop star is making her first round of appearances on television @entity25 in a decade			0
@entity29 , the network that shows " @entity19 , " is known for its news coverage , so they had little choice but to cover the debate , the channel 's head of programming told the @entity17			1
" we did n't really have any option -- we 're the number one for news and we have to cover the election debate live			0

she ousted @entity51 as leader of @entity2 's @entity53 , and prime minister , in june			2
@entity1 was @entity51 's deputy prime minister , but @entity53 members of @entity56 voted her into the top job as @entity51 's public approval declined			1
conservative opposition leader @entity3 was quick to condemn @entity1 's government when she called the election			2
" the prime minister wants to move forward because the recent past is so littered with her own failures , " he said			2
@entity1 , a 48 - year - old lawyer , said when she became prime minister that she was aware the move made her the nation 's first woman in that position , " and maybe the first redhead			1
" but , she said at the time , " i did n't set out to crash my head on any glass ceilings ; i set out to keep my feet on the floor			0
" since taking over , she has established a sizable lead in public approval polls over opposition leader @entity3			0
