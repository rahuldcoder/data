-- i 'm not an early riser			0
i have a rule against stepping outside my @entity5 apartment without first indulging in my café au lait			1
but after close to a decade of living here , i also know that if you 're craving a croissant , you have to go to a bakery well before noon to taste the city 's iconic breakfast staple at its most exquisite : still slightly warm from the oven , the irresistible aroma of freshly baked dough wafting upward while you 're pulling the whole thing apart , layer by buttery layer			1
travel snapshots : @entity5 so on a recent morning , i rose early and set out to find the city 's top pastry			1
others have gone on a quest for the perfect croissant , but always landed on swanky @entity26 addresses			1
i thought it was time to give the @entity28 its due , now that a new generation of young bakers have set up their ovens			1
@entity0 : affordable small hotels in @entity5 to start , i did n't have to go far from my apartment in the lively @entity36 quarter			1
in fact , i went right next door to @entity39			1
i 've long appreciated this bakery 's croissant for its extra-crisp ends — the best part — while the delicately layered center was soft and tender			1
it was a promising first stop , but there was more tasting to be done			0
heading up the hill toward @entity50 , where shaggy - haired @entity51 is known for spicing up baguettes with curry and rye bread with miso , i was surprised to find his croissant resolutely unadorned			1
the distinct layers , more shards than little flakes , had more of a crunch than the dainty bite i had hoped for			0
@entity0 : @entity64 's best neighborhoods for foodies an equally obsessed friend sent me to a busy corner of @entity68 for @entity69 by @entity70 , whose owner is a spirited presence on @entity74 television			2
here , the horseshoe - shaped croissants were lined up right next to the register			2
i ripped off one crisp end and let the wisps of warm , yeasted puff pastry melt in my mouth			0
this one stopped me in my tracks			0
was this the end of my quest ? never one to shy away from being thorough , i made a beeline for @entity87 , in the scenic @entity89 neighborhood			2
@entity91 's rustic breads are among the best in @entity5 , and i was curious to see how his artisanal croissant stacked up			1
this specimen was more substantial than the others , with a sturdy crust and hearty interior — too dense for my proustian ideal			0
but i could n't resist a crusty loaf of my favorite pain aux céréales for later			0
@entity0 : @entity102 's strangest desserts when i arrived in the charming @entity103 , i was worried i would n't have room for the hefty croissant at @entity106			1
one look at its crackly glazed crust , one bite into the tender interior , and i was enchanted			0
what set it apart ? a masterful hint of @entity74 sea salt in the dough			1
satisfied that i had found the ne plus ultra of croissants , i strolled out of the bakery , vowing to return the next morning , leaving a trail of crumbs in my wake			2
