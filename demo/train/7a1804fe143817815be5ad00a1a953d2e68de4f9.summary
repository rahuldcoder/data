" @entity75 said he hoped politicians applied " the same kind of thinking and rationality " as @entity12 did when dealing with @entity11			1
late thursday , the judge had ordered stricter limits on @entity14 , requiring that she " not to be present in public places , " such as shopping centers or movie theaters , except to receive necessary health care			1

" @entity1 authorities wanted @entity14 to stay home for 21 days -- the incubation period for the deadly virus -- although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms			1
@entity14 says that she is healthy and that forcing her to stay home is unconstitutional			1

" the reason there 's a police car there when she does that is to protect her , more than anybody			0

" but at the same token , her behavior is really riling a lot of people up , and i can only do what i can do			0
and we 're trying to protect her , but she 's not acting as smart as she probably should			0
" at first , @entity1 officials said they wanted her to remain at home for 21 days			0
