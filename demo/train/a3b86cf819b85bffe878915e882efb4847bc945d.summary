@entity0 -- president @entity2 on tuesday proposed making " pay - as - you - go " rules for federal spending into law			1
president @entity2 proposed tuesday that the government adopt " pay - as - you - go " rules for federal spending			2
the so - called @entity11 proposal requires @entity12 to balance any increased spending by equal savings elsewhere , @entity2 said in announcing the measure that now goes to @entity12			1
a previous @entity11 mandate helped erase federal budget deficits in the 1990s , and subsequent ineffective rules contributed to the current budget deficits , @entity2 said			2
now the @entity11 rules should be the law , he said			0
" paying for what you spend is basic common sense , " @entity2 said			1
" perhaps that 's why , here in @entity0 , it 's been so elusive			0
" @entity29 leaders said the proposal comes after record spending initiatives by the @entity2 administration , such as the $ 787 billion economic stimulus program			2
" it seems a tad disingenuous for the president and speaker [ @entity40 ] @entity39 to talk about @entity11 rules after ramming trillions in spending through @entity12 proposing policies that create more debt in the first six months of this year than in the previous 220 years combined , " said rep. @entity34 of @entity35 , the @entity36			1

some costs would be exempt , including @entity79 payments to doctors , the estate and gift tax , and tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2002 , the @entity62 statement said .			1
