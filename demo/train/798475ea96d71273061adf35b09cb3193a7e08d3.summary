@entity0 -- the dna of a girl authorities think may have been abducted by a @entity6 couple in @entity7 does n't match any profile in @entity10 's database , the international law enforcement agency said tuesday			1
in a case that has generated huge interest in @entity7 , authorities have charged the couple with abducting the child they call @entity17			1
@entity10 said @entity7 authorities have asked for its help in solving @entity17 's identity			1
" until now , a comparison of the girl 's profile against @entity10 's global dna database has not produced a match , " @entity10 said in a news release			0
@entity10 said it would make the database available to authorities in countries where someone who claims to be a possible blood relative to the child has submitted a @entity3 profile			1
the agency has more than 600 missing people listed on its website , 32 of whom are 5 or 6 years old			1
a spokesman for a @entity7 children 's charity said about 10 cases of missing children around the world are " being taken very seriously " in connection with @entity17 's case			1
" they include children from the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , " said @entity46 of the @entity48 charity			1
the couple who had @entity17 until last week appeared monday in court and were remanded into custody pending trial			1
a lawyer for the couple says the pair adopted the child from her biological mother			2
the @entity63 said the girl , who was found thursday in a @entity6 community near @entity66 , central @entity7 , is being cared for in a group home			1
medical tests indicate she is 5 to 6 years of age , slightly older than initially thought , said @entity46			1
police have said they suspect the records the couple provided for the child and for other children in their care may be false			2
in addition to the abduction charge , the couple is accused of falsifying official documents			0
four officials , including the head of the registry office that issued @entity17 's birth certificate , have been suspended while a police investigation is under way , the media office of the @entity0 municipality said tuesday			2
the girl received the document this year , it said			0
it is unusual for a birth certificate to be issued years later			2
1,000 years of @entity6 discrimination authorities asked questions about @entity17 because she has fair skin and blond hair , while her parents have darker complexions typical of @entity6 , a race descended from @entity103 nomads , who face widespread discrimination in @entity105			1
@entity106 , head of the local @entity6 community , said the couple took in the girl because her @entity111 mother could n't keep her			0
he said @entity17 was raised like a " normal " child			1
@entity46 said sunday that she was found in " bad living conditions , poor hygiene			0
" calls about the girl thousands of calls poured into @entity7 after authorities released photos of the girl last week			1
@entity121 and @entity121 , whose daughter @entity121 was 11 months old when she vanished two years ago from their home in @entity126 , @entity127 , asked the @entity128 to contact the @entity7 authorities about the case			1
" there is no such thing as a tip too small , " said @entity131 , whose hopes were raised despite the apparent disparity in age between their missing daughter and @entity17			1
" i am not sure there are enough similarities between the girls , " a federal law enforcement official said			0
still , the official added , the @entity128 is working with @entity7 authorities to determine whether the girl could be @entity121			1
a top official with the @entity148 in @entity149 said the center works with law enforcement groups to collect data , biometrics information and dna that can be used to compare with samples from @entity17			2
" frankly , right now ... it does not appear that this may be any of our children			0
but again we want to confirm one way or the other , " @entity159 , the senior executive director of the organization 's missing children division , said			1
he added that a definitive comparison could be done " rather quickly			0
" @entity164 has popped up elsewhere in @entity52 , a spokeswoman for the @entity166 said its @entity167 and @entity168 had been contacted by @entity10 to aid in identifying the girl , though there was no information that she is @entity52			0
" we are going through the files that we have and we are developing a list of possible children that could meet that criteria , " said sgt. @entity172			0
" we are currently looking at an age range of about 2 to 8 years old , we do n't want to exclude anybody			2
the files we currently have to look through number in the thousands , but they include boys as well			0
" once that number has been narrowed , police will contact local authorities to assist , " if needed , " she said			2
police : couple kept changing story authorities released photos of the two adults charged monday in the case -- @entity195 , 40 , and @entity196 , 39 -- in hopes that the publicity would reach someone who can provide more information about them			2
@entity10 said it was issuing what it calls a " blue notice " asking authorities in other nations if they have any additional information about @entity195 or @entity196			0
police said the blond child looked nothing like the man and woman with her , and dna testing confirmed that they were not her biological parents			1
a police statement said the couple " changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child			0
" a government news agency said police found suspicious birth and baptism records as well as family registrations that claimed the woman had given birth to 10 children and the man was the father of four more			2
" i used to see the mother , she would come to the square here to beg with the child , " a man in the @entity231 told the @entity233 news agency			0
" at one point , i had asked her how she got such a blond angel			0
she told me she had conceived it with a blond man			0
" prejudice against the @entity6 prejudice and discrimination against the @entity6 are widespread in @entity7 and elsewhere in @entity105 , @entity245 says			2
@entity17 's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor			1
@entity46 mentioned such a possibility , saying , " we do n't have any other information if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets			0
" the government news agency also raised " the possibility of the existence of a ring bringing pregnant women to @entity7 from @entity111 and then taking their children for sale			1
" the agency cited past reports that empty coffins had been found for infants who supposedly were stillborn to foreign mothers in @entity0			0
photo blog : the plight of the @entity6 @entity1 's @entity271 reported from @entity0 and @entity272 wrote in @entity273			0
