-- on a january night in 1961 , a @entity3 @entity2 bomber broke in half while flying over eastern @entity5			2
from the belly of the @entity7 fell two bombs -- two nuclear bombs that hit the ground near the city of @entity12			1
a disaster worse than the devastation wrought in @entity15 and @entity16 could have befallen the @entity3 that night			2
but it did n't , thanks to a series of fortunate missteps			2
declassified documents that the @entity22 released this week offered new details about the incident			2
the blaring headline read : " @entity26 was @entity28 ' armed ' when it crashed to @entity27			2
" or , as secretary of defense @entity34 put it back then , " by the slightest margin of chance , literally the failure of two wires to cross , a nuclear explosion was averted			2
" it 's difficult to calculate the destruction those bombs might have caused had they detonated in @entity5			1
what might 've been the website , nuclearsecrecy.com , allows users to simulate nuclear explosions			2
it says that one bomb the size of the two that fell in 1961 would emit thermal radiation over a 15 - mile radius			0
wind conditions , of course , could change that			0
the blast today , with populations in the area at their current level , would kill more than 60,000 people and injure more 54,000 , though the website warns that calculating casualties is problematic , and the numbers do not include those killed and injured by fallout			0
it 's also worth noting that @entity5 's 1961 total population was 47 % of what it is today , so if you apply that percentage to the numbers , the death toll is 28,000 with 26,000 people injured -- a far cry from those killed by smaller bombs on the more densely populated cities of @entity72 in @entity73			1
@entity75 researchers estimate that , respectively , @entity15 and @entity16 had populations of about 330,000 and 250,000 when they were bombed in august 1945			0
by that december , the cities ' death tolls included , by conservative estimates , at least 90,000 and 60,000 people			0
@entity81 , @entity5 , which includes @entity12 , had a population of about 84,000 in 1961			1
the state capital , @entity84 , is 50 miles northwest of @entity12 , and @entity85 -- home of the @entity87 's massive @entity86 -- is 60 miles southwest			1
the @entity12 incident the @entity7 was flying over @entity5 on january 24 , 1961 , when it suffered a " failure of the right wing , " the report said			1
as the plane broke apart , the two bombs plummeted toward the ground			1
the parachute opened on one ; it did n't on the other			0
" the impact of the aircraft breakup initiated the fuzing sequence for both bombs , " the summary of the documents said			1
in other words , both weapons came alarmingly close to detonating			1
weapon 1 , the bomb whose parachute opened , landed intact			0
fortunately , the safing pins that provided power from a generator to the weapon had been yanked -- preventing it from going off			0
@entity117 , the second bomb with the unopened parachute , landed in a free fall			0
the impact of the crash put it in the " armed " setting			0
fortunately -- once again -- it damaged another part of the bomb needed to initiate an explosion			0
while it 's unclear how frequently these types of accidents have occurred , the @entity126 has disclosed 32 accidents involving nuclear weapons between 1950 and 1980			1
there are at least 21 declassified accounts between 1950 and 1968 of aircraft - related incidents in which nuclear weapons were lost , accidentally dropped , jettisoned for safety reasons or on board planes that crashed			1
the accidents occurred in various @entity3 states , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , and over the @entity145 and @entity146 oceans and the @entity147			1
another five accidents occurred when planes were taxiing or parked			1
two months after the close call in @entity12 , another @entity7 was flying in the western @entity3 when the cabin depressurized and the crew ejected , leaving the pilot to steer the bomber away from populated areas , according to a @entity126 document			1
the plane crashed in @entity158 , @entity159 , but safety devices prevented the two onboard nuclear weapons from detonating			1
catastrophe averted the @entity12 incident was first detailed last year in the book " @entity166 " by @entity165			1
the documents released this week provided additional chilling details			0
eight crew members were aboard the plane that night			0
" i could see three or four other chutes against the glow of the wreckage , " recounted the co-pilot , maj. @entity173 , according to an account published by the @entity175			0
" i hit some trees			0
i had a fix on some lights and started walking			0
" the @entity183 bombs weighed 10,000 pounds and their explosive yield was 3.8 megatons			2
compare that to the bombs dropped in @entity15 and @entity16 : they were 0.01 and 0.02 megatons			1
but @entity173 did n't know then what a catastrophe had been avoided			0
" my biggest difficulty getting back was the various and sundry dogs i encountered on the road			0
" @entity15 atomic bomb attraction more popular than ever @entity195 meets atomic bomb survivors in @entity16 by the numbers : atomic bombs @entity0 's @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report			2

@entity12 one of 32 pre- 1980 accidents involving nukes
weeks after @entity12 , there was another close call in @entity159
the weapons came alarmingly close to detonation
they were far more powerful than the bombs dropped in @entity73
