-- a grueling qualification campaign is over , and for 32 footballing nations the dreaming can begin			0
on friday those lucky enough to have qualified for the @entity5 in @entity6 will learn who they are to meet in the group stage at one of the biggest sporting showpieces on the planet			1
the fixtures will be finalized -- this year by a more complicated process than previous events -- the participants will discover where their matches are to be played and they can start plotting a route to the final in @entity20			0
for the host nation , too , this is a chance to generate some positive news after months of headlines detailing delays in construction and public protests at spiraling costs			0
the most recent , and tragic , tale to emerge concerned the death of two construction workers after a crane collapsed at the @entity33 in @entity34 -- due to host the @entity5 's opening match			2
friday marks the start of a countdown to june 12 next year , when @entity6 will begin a month - long festival of football , likely to captivate the world			1
where ? the draw will take place in the resort of @entity45 do sauipe in @entity46 on the northeast coast of @entity6			1
in attendance will be representatives from each @entity5 nation as well as @entity52 's top brass , including president @entity53			2
the ceremony will be broadcast live to 193 countries from 1 p.m. local time ( 1700 cet ) with 1,300 guests alongside a bank of 2,000 reporters			0
as ever , there will be entertainment , including turns from @entity6 singers @entity64 and @entity66 as well as dance troupe @entity68 @entity67			2
there has been some controversy already when the two actors scheduled to host the draw -- @entity73 and @entity74 , who both have dark skin -- were replaced by another married celebrity couple , @entity76 and @entity77 , who are blond and white			0
what is it ? the @entity5 draw determines which of the 32 nations will face each other in the group stages			1
teams will be drawn into eight groups of four , based on @entity52 's seeding system and geographical separation , meaning that teams from the same qualification zone ca n't be drawn in the same group			2
there is an exception for @entity94 countries , given there are 13 participating in the tournament , but no more than two from the region can be drawn in the same group			1
the winners of a particular group will face the runner - up of another when the tournament enters its final - 16 stage -- the first of the knockout rounds			1
the seedings eight teams in the draw are seeded -- seven are the highest placed teams from @entity52 's rankings , the other is host @entity6			1
the top seven when the seedings were announced in october comprised of defending champion @entity114 along with @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
the seedings are calculated on how a team has played over the past four years , with the most recent year given greatest importance			0
teams earn ranking points for a win or a draw but nothing for a defeat			0
the points vary with each game depending on who is playing and whether it is a friendly or qualifying match			0
uneven numbers when there are eight unseeded @entity94 teams -- as in 2010 -- the draw works easily and smoothly , meaning @entity52 can organize the nations into four pots of eight teams			1
but because there are nine unseeded @entity94 teams in the @entity5 , things become a little more complicated			1
@entity52 has decided to put these nine teams into one pot , and prior to the draw they will pull out one nation to go into pot two with five @entity150 nations and the two unseeded @entity152 sides			1
that country will be selected at random , despite @entity155 -- which qualified through the playoffs -- being the lowest ranked nation from the @entity94 qualifying phase			0
this random element has not gone down well with some of the other countries in that part of the draw			0
@entity163 as a starting point , @entity164 will automatically be drawn into @entity166 due to its role as host			0
then the other seeded teams will be allocated their groups , which runs as far as @entity171 and then it gets rather complicated			0
with one of the unseeded @entity94 teams now residing in pot two , there are now nations from three geographical zones in the same pot. that increases the chances of three @entity94 teams ending up in the same group , a violation of @entity52 's " geographical separation " principle			1
as such , the governing body decided to create " @entity163 " into which four of the seeded @entity152 teams will be placed			1
one is drawn out and then paired together in a group with the unseeded @entity94 team from pot two			2
after that , the rest of the teams will be allocated to their groups -- with the only other issue residing with @entity198 and @entity199 , who can skip a group in order to avoid being drawn with seeded @entity152 teams			1
group of death as ever with any high - profile soccer draw there is the potential for the much - touted " @entity209			2
" whichever unseeded @entity94 team is plucked out of pot four and put into pot two might be forgiven for watching the rest of the draw from behind their sofa			2
that nation will be guaranteed to face one of the @entity152 seeds from @entity163 -- @entity6 , @entity117 , @entity118 or @entity120			1
then they could face the @entity221 from pot three and either @entity223 or @entity224 from pot four , making qualification for the last 16 much harder .			0

the draw for the @entity5 finals takes place in @entity46 , @entity6 on friday
thirty - two nations from across the globe await their fate for the 2014 tournament
teams are seeded and organized into four different pots , with an extra " *x-* factor "
