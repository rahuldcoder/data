-- two @entity3 journalists who were found guilty in @entity4 of supporting terrorism were sentenced to 11 years in jail tuesday , the @entity1 said			1
" our belief was that the court would think they were journalists and they would be released			2
this is what the prime minister has said before , " ministry spokesman @entity10 said			0
" it is not fair that they are sentenced since they are journalists on a journalistic mission			2
" " they are innocent and have been convicted because of their journalistic work , " said @entity18 , the journalists ' @entity3 attorney			1
" we are very disappointed			2
" a court convicted @entity24 and @entity25 last week			0
@entity4 troops captured @entity24 and @entity25 in july during an exchange of gunfire with a rebel group in the @entity30 , a prohibited region along the nation 's border with @entity33 , according to state media			1
@entity4 officials accused the journalists of being accomplices to terrorism after the government declared the @entity41 a terrorist group in june			1
@entity18 said the 11 - year sentence was the lowest possible one for the crimes they were convicted of			2
" the prosecutor sought 18 years imprisonment , so if you look at it that way , it is a positive thing that they got the lowest possible sentence , " @entity18 said			2
" but since they are innocent , they are very disappointed			2
" @entity25 and @entity24 have until january 10 to decide if they want to appeal -- a process that could take up to two years -- or if they want to seek a pardon			0
however , @entity18 said , if they want to apply for a pardon the two have to admit the crimes , " and since they are not guilty then this is not something they 'd want to do			0
" @entity65 at the @entity3 - based photojournalism agency @entity66 , for which the two men work , said they " have a very hard decision ahead of them " in considering whether to appeal or ask for a pardon , but that an 11 - year sentence in an @entity4 prison " could effectively be a death sentence for them			1
" @entity65 added : " the purpose of this verdict is to scare away all journalists from reporting in the @entity30			1
but as journalists we have to continue reporting from closed areas			0
it 's a very sad day for press freedom			0
it 's a very sad day but it did n't come as a surprise for us			0
it 's still a political verdict ; it 's not a real trial			0
it is the ( @entity4 ) prime minister who has decided			1
" @entity24 and @entity25 were convicted on two counts : entering the country illegally and providing assistance to a terrorist organization , according to the @entity92 ( @entity92 )			0
press freedom groups say the two were embedded with the rebels while working on a story about the region			0
journalists and aid workers are prohibited from entering the @entity30 , where human rights organizations say human rights abuses against ethnic @entity33 by rebels and @entity4 troops are rampant			1
" the @entity4 army 's answer to the rebels has been to viciously attack civilians in the @entity30 , " said @entity104 of @entity105			1
" these widespread and systematic atrocities amount to crimes against humanity			0
" @entity112 criticized the court 's decision			0
" what are the @entity4 authorities hoping to achieve ? " the international secretariat of the group asked			1
" to discourage anyone from visiting the @entity30 , as these two journalists did ? to send a warning signal to the national and international media about the danger of receiving a long jail sentence on a terrorism charge if they attempt any potentially embarrassing investigative reporting ? " " our starting point is and remains that they have been in the country on a journalistic mission , " @entity3 prime minister @entity127 said in a statement last week			1
" they should be freed as soon as possible and be able to rejoin their families in @entity3			0
" but presiding judge @entity137 said the two " have not been able to prove that they did not support terrorism			2
" " they have shown that they are esteemed journalists , but we can not conclude that someone with a good reputation does not engage in criminal acts , " @entity137 said			0
both journalists pleaded guilty to entering the country illegally through @entity33 without accreditation , according to the @entity92 , which says @entity4 officials deny media access without government minders			1
" we have documented violations of due process and the politicization of their trial , " the @entity92 said , complaining that the government pronounced the two guilty even before the trial started			0
@entity159 called for their release ahead of tuesday 's sentencing			0
" there is nothing to suggest that the two men entered @entity4 with any intention other than conducting their legitimate work as journalists			1
the government chooses to interpret meeting with a terrorist organization as support of that group and therefore a terrorist act , " said @entity168 with the human rights group			1
in a statement issued in september , @entity66 said that its journalists do not take sides or participate in any conflict and report under international rights regarding @entity181 , which it believes should be upheld by any government			2
the trial against the journalists turned into a fight for press freedom in @entity4 , according to international journalists ' organizations			1
in a letter sent to the @entity192 , @entity112 accused @entity4 of using its anti-terrorism law to lessen press freedom and penalize free speech			2
" in the name of the fight against terrorism , the government muzzles dissident and critical voices , thus abusing human rights and fundamental freedoms , " wrote the secretary general of @entity112 , @entity197 - @entity196			1
@entity0 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0

new : a long prison term in @entity4 could be a death sentence , the journalists ' agency says
the journalists ' attorney says they are " very disappointed " by the verdict
the judge says the two failed to prove their innocence
human rights groups say @entity4 failed to provide justice
