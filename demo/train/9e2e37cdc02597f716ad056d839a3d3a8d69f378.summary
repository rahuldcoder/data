after several minutes ' delay , the match continued and ended in a 0 - 0 draw			2
@entity5 coach @entity21 later said the official 's decision was not strong enough			1
" in my opinion , there 's only one solution to racism in stadium and that 's suspend the match , " @entity21 said on @entity5 's website			1
" to get rid of this stuff in our stadiums , you have to make big decisions			0
it could penalize some people but in the long run it would help us to grow as a nation and become more civilized			0
" he told reporters at the post-match conference : " there 's no point in interrupting the game			2
it 's a middle ground decision and it serves no purpose			0
either the game should be suspended or you keep playing			0
" @entity9 gave all he had this evening , but he 's 22 years old and always subject to these racist boos and that 's not good			1
people go to the stadium to watch the two teams but there 's always these uncivilized people			0
" @entity6 was fined â‚¬ 50,000 ( $ 65,000 ) by the @entity1 league on monday , its fans having been accused of abusing three @entity5 players -- though none were named in the @entity64 's notification of the punishment			1
the club issued a statement saying it " condemns any form of racial abuse			0

@entity5 's @entity91 walked off the pitch due to racist abuse during a friendly match against a lower league team in january , being followed by his teammates			1
he has since joined the anti-racism task force set up by world soccer 's governing body @entity97			0

@entity117 took offense when @entity12 booked @entity9 in the first half , and was ordered off after trying to prevent the referee from issuing another yellow card when the midfielder protested the decision			1
the veteran @entity126 international clasped the official 's arms and kept them pinned to his side , but was eventually sent from the pitch after @entity91 intervened to calm him down			0
" @entity117 made a mistake but it 's in the past now , " @entity21 told reporters			2

@entity138 stayed in contention by beating @entity146 1 - 0 with a first - half goal from veteran striker @entity148 that relegated the visiting team			1
@entity9 racially abused again in @entity110 : why @entity151 must act now to miss out on the @entity143 , @entity5 will have to lose next weekend 's final match at relegated @entity153 , while @entity138 must beat bottom club @entity154 -- or win by more than four goals if the @entity5 draw			1
