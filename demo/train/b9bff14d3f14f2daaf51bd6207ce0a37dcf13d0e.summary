@entity0 , @entity1 -- a defense lawyer for @entity4 made an impassioned plea to the jury wednesday as the high - profile case neared its conclusion			1
@entity9 is the @entity10 student accused of killing her @entity12 roommate , @entity14 , at the villa they shared in @entity1			1
" we suffer at the memory of @entity14			0
but we look at the future of @entity4 , " @entity19 said in his defense summation			1
" @entity14 was my friend , " he quoted @entity9 as saying , rejecting the notion that she hated her roommate , who was fatally stabbed in november 2007			1
prosecutors say @entity26 died during a twisted sex game in which @entity9 taunted @entity26 , and two men -- @entity9 's then - boyfriend @entity29 , 26 , and acquaintance @entity14 -- sexually assaulted her			1
the prosecution says a knife found in @entity29 's house had @entity9 's dna on the handle and @entity26 's on the blade , among other pieces of evidence			2
but @entity19 rejected the accusations against @entity9 on wednesday			1
he attacked the way police and prosecutors had treated the defendant , giving them a symbolic " red card " -- a referee 's sign in soccer that a player is being expelled from the game for breaking the rules			2
@entity19 concluded an emotional oration -- sobbing as he came to the end -- by asking the judge and jury to acquit @entity9 , because her mother asked him to request it , because her family asked it			1
@entity9 's father , @entity59 , said wednesday she had been a victim of " character assassination , " and expressed hope she would be found not guilty			1
members of @entity26 's family have declined repeated @entity2 requests for comment on the case			2
but prosecutor @entity67 accused the defense of " lynching " the @entity1 police who worked on the case			1
he defended the work of the police and the credibility of the prosecution witnesses as he responded to @entity19 's arguments wednesday			1
and he called again for life sentences for @entity9 and @entity29 if they are found guilty			0
@entity1 does not have the death penalty			0
the jury is expected to begin deliberations on friday , after the prosecution completes its summary			0
another @entity9 attorney on tuesday said the prosecution 's theory does n't fit the facts of the case and there is not sufficient evidence to find her guilty			1
calling @entity9 a victim herself , @entity92 said the police had rushed to judgment following the murder , leaving @entity9 to fend off a myriad of false media reports regarding the crime			2
the lawyer showed photos published in the media , purportedly showing the crime scene , that were n't authentic -- including a photo of the bathroom -- and said false allegations and rumors about @entity9 's character created a bias from the start			1
@entity113 also questioned the change in what prosecutor @entity67 said was the motive for the murder			0
in preliminary hearings , @entity67 argued @entity9 , @entity29 and @entity119 slashed @entity26 's throat during a sexual misadventure as the two men vied for @entity9 's attention			2
in recent days , @entity67 has focused more on what he says was a hatred between the two roommates			0
defense lawyers have staunchly disagreed , claiming the two women were friends			0
@entity19 on wednesday said the two had gone to a chocolate festival together days before @entity26 was killed			2
the defense has argued that @entity119 , who was convicted in a separate fast - track trial and is currently appealing his conviction , was the sole killer			0
the defense has said there is no evidence tying the three suspects together or proving they planned @entity26 's murder			0
@entity113 also focused during closing arguments on the lack of evidence tying @entity9 to the crime scene			2
as defense lawyers have throughout the entire trial , he cast doubt on dna evidence that prosecutors claim shows @entity9 's dna on the handle of the alleged murder weapon			1
the defense has said the knife does n't match @entity26 's wounds or an imprint of the knife left on a bedsheet , and the dna sample is too small to be conclusive			0
during the first day of closing arguments for @entity9 's lawyers , @entity92 stressed to the eight - member jury that they should also keep church law in mind as they decide whether to find @entity9 and @entity29 guilty or not guilty			1
he told the jury they needed to be " morally certain of their decision			0
" " if you have the minimum of doubts , you must absolve this young girl -- a girl that is merely 22 years old , " he said			0
@entity9 and @entity29 , who both deny any role in the murder , have been jailed for more than two years since they were arrested on charges of murder and sexual violence			0
their trial began in january			0
@entity2 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
