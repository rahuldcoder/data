-- @entity1 was 14 when her mother sat her down and said they needed to see a gynecologist			0
while pregnant with @entity5 in the mid- 1960s her mom had taken a synthetic estrogen known as diethylstilbestrol ( @entity9 ) , which at the time was prescribed to prevent miscarriages and complications			2
later that decade , however , doctors connected the drug to a rare form of vaginal cancer that was turning up in young women exposed to @entity9 in the womb			1
@entity1 's first pap test came back abnormal			0
over the next several decades she endured countless abnormal results , biopsies , and preventive surgeries , but fortunately she never developed cancer			0
but in her early 30s @entity9 came up in a different context , when she consulted a fertility specialist after trying for several months to get pregnant			2
" i was filling out a questionnaire before my appointment , and there it was : ' did your mother take @entity9 ? ' " @entity1 recalls			0
" before then , no one had ever told me i 'd have a problem getting pregnant			0
" @entity0 : a top doctor reveals 8 fertility misconceptions @entity38 , it turns out , is just one of the potential health problems faced by the millions of women like @entity1 who were exposed to @entity9 in the womb			1
according to a new government study published this week in the @entity46 , these so - called @entity9 daughters are at higher - than - normal risk for an array of reproductive complications and other problems , including infertility			1
researchers at the @entity53 analyzed data from three separate studies that have followed more than 4,000 des - exposed women since the 1970s			1
compared with a control group of unexposed women , des daughters were found to have higher rates of infertility ( 33 % versus 16 % ) , miscarriage ( 50 % versus 39 % ) , preterm delivery ( 53 % versus 18 % ) , and ectopic pregnancy ( 15 % versus 3 % )			2
the @entity9 - exposed women were also 82 % more likely to develop breast cancer after age 40 , and more than twice as likely to experience menopause before age 45			1
for most of the health conditions included in the study , the increase in risk was even greater for @entity9 daughters who had been exposed to especially high doses of the drug			1
@entity0 : 25 breast cancer myths busted " investigators tend to just study disease rather than people			1
but this actually looks at ... the risk for an individual woman who 's been exposed and tells her what exactly it means to her , " says @entity80 , @entity81 , the lead author of the study and the director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the @entity53 , in @entity86 , @entity87			2
" when you look at it that way , the numbers are somewhat staggering			0
" as many as 10 million people were exposed to @entity9 in the womb between 1938 , when the drug appeared on the market , and 1971 , when the @entity102 urged doctors to stop prescribing it			1
( as if the health fallout were n't reason enough , researchers had also discovered that @entity9 was n't effective at preventing miscarriages			0
) many of the potential health complications identified in the new study have been raised in previous research , in some cases with conflicting results			0
a 2010 study of @entity9 daughters conducted in the @entity116 , for instance , found no link between exposure and breast - cancer risk			1
( fifty - three @entity9 daughters who developed breast cancer have brought a lawsuit against several @entity9 manufacturers ; the lawsuit is currently under way in @entity126			1
) @entity0 : 5 simple things that could cut your breast cancer risk researchers ca n't explain the apparent link between @entity9 exposure and health problems , but lab experiments in animals have suggested that the drug may cause harmful cell changes or compromise immune function , the study notes			1
despite the long history of @entity9 research , the " vast majority " of health professionals working today know very little about the drug , says @entity145 , a nurse practitioner in @entity146 , @entity147 , who worked for 20 years in a state screening center for @entity9 daughters operated by the @entity151			1
" they either have never heard of it , or they think that it 's long over with -- that the women affected are all dead , " @entity145 says			0
" hopefully this [ study ] will have a bigger impact and get doctors looking at some of the risk factors for these women that they were n't already			2
" @entity80 and his colleagues recommend that doctors and researchers continue to monitor women who were exposed to @entity9 in the womb			2
some researchers have also begun to look for abnormal health patterns in the daughters of des daughters , a group known as the @entity9 granddaughters			2
@entity0 : can pregnancy predict your risk of breast cancer ? @entity1 , now 47 , does n't have to worry about passing any des - related problems on to a daughter			1
tests conducted in her early 30s showed that she had the hormone levels and reproductive system of a 45 - year - old , as well as a very small uterus			0
( like most des - exposed women , @entity1 ca n't conclusively prove @entity9 directly caused these abnormalities			1
) after an unsuccessful round of in vitro fertilization , @entity1 sought solace in an online advocacy and support group , @entity192 , and a year later adopted a baby boy			0
her experience has made her " very wary " of prescription drugs and dietary supplements that have n't been well - researched , even though she works as a consultant for the dietary - supplement industry in @entity199 , @entity200			0
" i do n't know what i 'm going to do when i get to menopause and have hot flashes , because i certainly do n't want to take hormones , " she says			0
@entity0 : can supplements ease menopause symptoms ? for his part , @entity80 says the new study reiterates the importance of continuing to make clinical research safer and more thorough in the future			0
" if it was n't for this small group of women with this bizarre cancer back in the ' 60s , we would n't know anything about what turned out to be a major public - health disaster , " he says			2
" it 's a wake - up call for us to wonder how many other drugs might be out there that are also causing all sorts of adverse health effects			0
