-- @entity1 may be in an economic mess these days , but the ancient gods are back in vogue , at least in @entity5 , where the success of " 300 " and " @entity8 " novelist @entity7 has not gone unnoticed			1
@entity16 that with today 's computer - generated visuals , which allow you to conjure up armies of extras at the press of a button , and " immortals " virtually writes itself			1
( in fact the dour , humorless screenplay is credited to @entity19 and @entity20			0
) less " 300 2 " than " @entity26 , " " immortals " is a sledgehammer action spectacle interspersed with bouts of enervating pseudo-philosophical discourse and moments of fine visual embellishment			0
rising star @entity28 ( " @entity31 " and @entity29 's " @entity30 " ) is @entity32 , a @entity1 commoner who never knew his father , but who has found a kindly mentor in a wise old man who schools him in sword fighting , ethics and such			1
what @entity32 does n't know is that the old guy ( played by @entity43 on @entity44 and @entity45 when mortal eyes are n't peeking ) is actually @entity47 , the king of the gods , who has been grooming the lad to lead the @entity50 against the onslaught of the blood - thirsty @entity52 ( @entity53 )			1
if @entity52 gets his mitts on the @entity55 of @entity56 ( archery 's answer to a ballistic missile ) , he 'll free the @entity60 and all hell will break loose			1
why does n't zeus intervene directly ? apparently that 's against the divine rules , though the @entity64 are n't above bending them whenever @entity52 seems on the verge of a decisive blow			2
wearing scrummy gold outfits that would n't look out of place in a @entity71 toga party , the gods are the @entity50 ' pinch - hitters supreme			2
director @entity73 ( " @entity74 , " " @entity75 " ) is a fabulist ; more than anything , he wants his images to shine			0
and they do , in places			0
a vision of celestials locked in permanent heavenly combat -- inspired by the @entity84 -- is simply breathtaking			0
( it 's virtually the last thing we see in the movie , but before you shout " spoiler , " it 's also the poster image			1
) the costume and design are often out of this world			0
and yet the movie 's landscape is a disappointingly barren digital domain , the same gray cliffs , deserts and seas familiar from " 300 " and so many game - worlds			1
it 's not just that this is visually blah ( though it is ) , it 's also as inherently artificial and airless as any studio movie of the 1930s or 40s			1
when @entity73 's camera catches a sun - flare at morning or dusk , it 's supposed to imbue the shot with a sense of reality			2
but because that sunbeam is patently just another digital effect , it actually accomplishes the opposite : it falsifies the actors ' environment and reminds us this is n't really happening			0
( i counted the trick three times			0
) to my eyes , the @entity26 only makes the movie look phonier ; the actors often seem to exist in a different visual plane to their surroundings			2
they might as well be performing in front of cardboard flats			0
still , in @entity137 , @entity28 , @entity45 , @entity138 ( as @entity32 ' sidekick @entity135 ) , and @entity136 ( as the so - called " @entity134 " ) , @entity73 has cast actors strong or pretty enough to hold us through the movie 's turgid breast - beating , grisly violence and numbskull plotting			1
there are n't many flicks that @entity53 ca n't perk up , and here he 's adorned in the full enchilada , even more scars than nature intended , a shimmering silver face mask , and a bonnet that seems to have been modeled on a @entity152			2
another ( this is a heck of a mad - hatter 's movie ) has horns like a lobster claw -- or a jackass			1
in short , the plumage is eye - catching but the meat does n't have much flavor			0
the stuff of legend it ai n't .			0

the film stars @entity28 who will also be the " @entity30 "
@entity43 and @entity45 share the role of @entity47 , king of the gods
the movie offers the usual special effects , but *reviewer* says it 's " visually blah "
