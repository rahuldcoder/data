what 's good for the heart may not be so healthy for other organs , says the latest study that links omega - 3 fatty acids to an elevated risk of prostate cancer			1
it 's not just an apple a day that keeps the doctor away anymore — recently , fish oils found in species like salmon , trout and tuna have been associated with a lower risk of heart disease and even @entity18			1
in fact , the most recent revisions to the @entity20 for @entity21 in 2010 recommended consumers substitute high - fat protein sources with more seafood , including fatty fish			2
not surprisingly , fish oil has since skyrocketed to be the most popular supplement in the @entity21			2
a new study in the @entity34 , however , shows that these fish fats may not be improving everyone 's health — in the trial , those with high concentrations of marine - derived omega - 3s in their blood showed a 43 % higher risk of developing prostate cancer than those with the lowest levels			1
@entity43 : omega - 3s as study aid ? prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men , and while the latest statistics show that most men will eventually develop prostate cancer if they live long enough , only a specific type of cancer , known as high - grade , carries high risk of serious health problems			2
while a quarter of a million @entity21 are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year , only about 30,000 of those cases are fatal , and almost all of them involve high - grade cancer			0
the latest research found that the association between omega - 3s and prostate cancer held for both high - and low - grade prostate cancers			0
it 's not that omega - 3s are harmful , but that the fatty acids may have more complex effects on the body than previously thought			0
" we have this tendency to talk about good foods and bad foods , good nutrients and bad nutrients , " says doctor @entity73 , a research assistant professor at the @entity74 and the study 's head author			0
the nutrients commonly found in fish fight potentially damaging inflammation , but they may also increase oxidative damage to the dna in cells , similar to the effects of stress , that can create fertile ground for cancers to grow			1
@entity43 : @entity94 supplements do n't lower heart disease risk the study measured omega - 3 blood levels in the participating men , and did not include information on the volunteers ' eating habits , so researchers could not differentiate between the effects of fatty acids from fish from those of supplements			1
however , the overwhelming majority of the participants did not take fish oil supplements			2
based on the results , @entity73 says that men with a family history of prostate cancer should discuss with their doctor whether fish oil supplements are safe for them , since these pills tend to contain concentrated doses of @entity94 — supplements contain between 30 % to 60 % of a serving of fish , and if a fish oil supplement is taken everyday , that adds up to a lot of daily fish oil			1
@entity73 also suggested that men cut down on their fatty fish intake , though not eliminate it entirely			0
@entity130 , a statistician specializing in prostate cancer at @entity132 , agrees , saying that fish oil supplements may pose a relatively higher risk for prostate cancer than fish in the diet			2
" the problem comes when you take components of a diet and put it in a pill , " @entity130 says			0
while the omega - 3 fatty acids may increase oxidative damage to prostate cells , for example , anti-oxidants , which might be part of an overall healthy diet that includes fish as well as fruits and vegetables , might counteract these effects			1
because the study did not query the men about their diets , it 's difficult to tell whether the men were consuming other healthy foods as well			0
@entity43 : omega - 3s may not protect brain health after all most health experts recommend that people try to eat a healthy , balanced diet to protect against diseases and most cancers , and turn to supplements only if that 's not possible , since supplements may provide only partial benefits			1
that 's why the @entity173 does not currently recommend that men take fish oil supplements , according to @entity176 , the society 's strategic director of nutritional epidemiology			1
@entity73 's work is n't the first to suggest that omega - 3 fatty acids may have both positive and negative effects on the body			0
in a september 2012 article in the @entity185 , researchers found that omega - 3 supplements were not associated with lower risks of stroke or cardiac death			2
those results were confirmed by another study in the @entity192 that showed omega - 3 supplements did not reduce risk of dying from a heart event among a group of people at high risk of heart disease			1
researchers involved in those studies , however , acknowledged that they were not able to account for the effect of other medications to treat heart problems , such as cholesterol - lowering drugs and blood pressure medications , in keeping death rates down			0
in the same way , more research will have to tease apart how other nutrients in a balanced diet — including antioxidants — work together to influence the effect of individual nutrients like omega - 3 fatty acids			0
