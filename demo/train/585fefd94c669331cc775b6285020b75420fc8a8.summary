with its skies regularly shrouded by a filthy film of gray smog , bringing chaos to the transportation network and forcing millions to seek refuge behind surgical masks , @entity0 has been forced to take more extreme action			1
officials in @entity11 's capital this week announced a raft of emergency measures in a bid to tackle the problem , including mandatory factory closures and bans on cars entering the city on days when pollution levels are particularly high			1
while @entity0 is not alone when it comes to smoke - filled skies , this city of more than 20 million people has come to symbolize the environmental cost of @entity11 's break - neck economic growth			1
red alert the city 's @entity28 stipulates that when there is " serious pollution for three consecutive days , " a warning system comprising of blue , yellow , orange and red -- the most serious -- alerts will be activated			1
kindergartens , primary and middle schools will then have to stop classes , while 80 % of government - owned cars must be taken off the roads			0
private cars will only be allowed to enter the city on alternate days according to ballot system of the numbers on their registration plates			2
all freight vehicles and those transporting material for construction sites will be barred from the roads when the red alert is issued , while more watering carts and sprinkler trucks will take to the roads , the state - run @entity48 reported			0
factories in the city emitting pollutants will be required to cut their emissions or shut down completely when the orange warning signal is hoisted , while construction sites must halt excavation and demolition operations			2
other measures include a ban on barbeques and fireworks on heavily polluted days			2
harmful to health according to the plan , these emergency measures will come into play when the air quality index for fine particulate matter , pm2.5 -- airborne particles considered most harmful to health -- exceeds 300 micrograms per cubic meter for three days running			1
the " safe " limit is 25 micrograms , the @entity79 says			0
while the announcement has been broadly welcomed as a step in the right direction , doubt remains about its long - term effectiveness			0
" the new emergency measures show the government 's determination to tackle the air pollution in @entity0 , especially those regulations that limit car use and close schools and kindergartens on heavily polluted days			1
it shows that the authority has really paid attention to those vulnerable groups , " @entity94 , a spokesman for @entity95 , told @entity96			0
" but what is problematic is that those emergency measures are only targeted to those polluted days			1
it is rather a remedial measure than a preventative measure , and just to repair wo n't help the issue in the long run			0
" the air pollution in @entity0 is mostly transmitted from other cities , and what @entity0 can do is very limited			1
what the authority should do is to build a linkage mechanism , combining preventative measures with emergency control			2
for instance , factories in surrounding areas like @entity117 , and @entity118 could close their factories in advance before the potential transmission of serious pollutants			0
it should be collaborative work between cities , and only @entity0 is not enough			0
" popular opinion this view was backed by many ordinary @entity11 on @entity129 , @entity11 's popular micro-blogging service			1
" they should have some long - term thinking instead of always waiting till the crisis happens , " posted one user with the handle @entity131			0
another , called @entity136 , asked : " how about those people who ca n't afford an expensive house in the city and have to take cars to work every day ? " " cars are not the main polluters , surrounding factories are			0
sometimes the pollution level still goes up crazily even it 's around 2 or 3 a.m. the policy itself is good , but it 's more important how they implement it , " said @entity144			0
positive action last month , the central government in @entity11 announced plans to start listing its top ten most air - polluted cities every month in the hope that national humiliation will push positive environmental action			2
" we must put air quality control as an ecological red line for economic management and social development , " @entity11 's vice premier @entity158 said in a statement as he announced the new policy at the 18th @entity161 in @entity0			1
@entity11 officials did not say when the first list would be announced , but the northern megacities of @entity0 and @entity170 , as well as the surrounding provinces of @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity117 and @entity118 have signed onto an official plan to speed up air pollution control measures			1
meanwhile , life was returning to some semblance of normality in northeastern @entity11 wednesday as days of smog - filled skies brought one city to a standstill			1
thick smog closed @entity184 's international airport , affecting hundreds of flights , and closed schools and businesses as visibility in some areas was reduced to less than 20 meters ( 65 feet )			0
some buildings could barely be seen from the opposite side of the street , while drivers brave enough to take to the roads were forced to flash their hazard warning lights			0
the unusually severe pollution levels were blamed on the city 's coal - fired heating system , as well as farmers burning straw as temperatures in the region begin to drop .			2

@entity0 authorities to close factories , reduce vehicle *traffic* to reduce pollution
emergency measures come into effect after " three consecutive days " of smog
@entity11 's capital has symbolized the environmental cost of economic growth
environmentalists say plan must involve more than one city
