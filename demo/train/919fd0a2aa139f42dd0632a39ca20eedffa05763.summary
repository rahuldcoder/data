-- when people come to my house for the first time there exists only a handful of personal items worth showing off as part of the tour			1
mind you , it 's a rather short and uninspiring tour			1
the gift shop basically consists of pudding			2
and i 'm usually not wearing pants			2
nevertheless , if one does take a quick walk - about of the @entity18 , the first thing i 'll show them is a framed original @entity19 from 1972 with @entity20 on the cover			2
it 's pretty much the only thing i own of any interest			1
beyond that , i 'm left to intrigue visitors with a bunch of large sticks i tossed in a vase			2
also , in the kitchen , i have a collection of condiments			2
none of which ever seem to impress			2
" sir , i appreciate that you have two different flavors of @entity38 , but i really just need you to sign for this package			2
" fortunately , i finally found the perfect decorative conversation starter to proudly display somewhere within the six cubic feet of space not being lorded over by my dog			2
and what is this amazing piece of art ? well , much in the @entity48 spirit , it 's a giant friggin ' egg ! you 'd have to hide it behind a @entity51			1
and if your kid ca n't find it , you failed as a parent			0
at a foot high and eight inches wide , it 's essentially the same size as @entity59 's head			1
( but covered with far fewer leftover , greasy chunks of turducken			0
) and it would look great in my living room next to the sticks			0
the only problem is that when it goes up for auction at @entity69 in @entity70 during a travel and science sale at the end of april , it 'll likely gavel for more than $ 45,000			1
you see , the reason this particular egg is worth so much money -- and the reason so many people started talking about it online after @entity69 's put it up for display -- is that it 's a fully intact , fossilized ovum of the long - extinct elephant bird			1
other artifacts like this have been pieced together from shell fragments			0
but this one is in mint condition			0
and if you have the money , what a great way to honor the elephant bird ! up until about the 17th century , the oxymoronically named animal lived happily on the island nation of @entity96			1
and at about 10 feet tall , it was once the largest winged creature to walk the planet			0
but it did n't fly , for that would be asking a lot			0
" fly , stupid bird ! " " @entity106 , have you seen me ? " the thing was absolutely enormous -- much bigger than an ostrich			1
and , apparently , it squeezed out these huge eggs that could feed a small army for a month			0
or , i suppose , the entire @entity114 offensive line for about ... six minutes			0
" easy there , @entity116			0
in fact , a single elephant bird egg is about the equivalent of 120 normal chicken eggs			1
and scientists say the elephant birds ' lays ( is that the right word ? ) were even bigger than those of the dinosaurs			1
which would have been especially disconcerting to @entity130			0
of course , personally speaking as a mammal -- specifically a male mammal -- it 's difficult to even imagine what birthing a big , round , shelled oval must have felt like			1
which is fine because , really , such considerations do n't politely lend themselves to normal conversation			0
unless , perhaps , you birthed the spirit of friendship			0
but even then , it 's of questionable taste			1
and then what happened ? " " i literally exploded with kindness			1
" there 's no saying who might ultimately bid on this elephant bird egg , but , clearly , it takes an eccentric -- someone prone to spending money on things that do n't serve a greater purpose beyond just being weird for the sake of weird			1
" @entity159 , what the hell did you just buy ? " " it 's a used toothpick from @entity164			1
you know , for my collection			0
" @entity167 , when you think about , that might also be worth having			0
it would look nice in my vase of sticks .			0

an elephant bird egg is to be auctioned in @entity70 at @entity69
the egg is expected to sell for more than $ 45,000
@entity181 : " it 's literally about the size of @entity59 's head . "
the enormous egg is perfectly fossilized and hundreds of years old
