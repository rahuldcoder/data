-- the widow of a victim killed in last year 's @entity4 movie theater shooting is suing the accused gunman 's psychiatrist and the university where she works			1
the psychiatrist should have advised police to apprehend suspect @entity11 weeks before the theater rampage , @entity8 said in a civil lawsuit filed in federal court			1
@entity8 's 26 - year - old husband , @entity15 , was one of 12 people slain in the july 20 shooting			2
dr. @entity22 , the psychiatrist who works at the @entity23 and saw @entity11 as a patient , " knew that @entity11 was dangerous " and " had a duty to use reasonable care to protect the public at large from @entity11 , " according to the lawsuit			1
an attorney representing @entity26 could not be immediately reached for comment tuesday			0
@entity28 , a spokeswoman for the @entity29 , said officials there were aware of the lawsuit and had received notice that 11 others could be filed			2
report : @entity11 ' psychiatrist reported behavior to colleagues " the @entity29 has nothing but sympathy for the victims of the @entity44 and their families , but in our initial review of this case , the @entity23 believes this lawsuit is not well - founded legally or factually , " @entity39 said in a written statement			1
on june 11 -- more than five weeks before the shooting -- @entity11 told @entity26 that " he fantasized about killing a lot of people , " the lawsuit says			1
but according to the lawsuit , when a police officer asked whether @entity11 should be placed on a psychiatric hold for 72 hours , @entity26 " rejected the idea			1
" the lawsuit accuses @entity26 of negligence and said the university is also liable			1
in august , @entity26 testified in court that her contact with @entity11 ended on july 11			2
she said she later contacted campus police because she was " so concerned " about what happened during her last meeting with him , but she declined to detail what bothered her			0
@entity11 , a 25 - year - old former doctoral student in neuroscience , faces 166 charges , including murder , attempted murder and weapons offenses , tied to the rampage during a screening of " @entity78 : @entity79			1
" his interactions with @entity26 before the shooting have come up several times during court proceedings			0
just nine minutes before he burst into the suburban mall movie theater , @entity11 tried to call @entity26 but failed to reach her , prosecutors have said			2
in september , a judge ruled that a notebook mailed to @entity26 would not be accessible to prosecutors			0
last week the judge overseeing @entity11 's case agreed to delay an arraignment in the case to allow defense lawyers more time to pore over 30,000 pages of evidence and hundreds of dvds and @entity97 the arraignment -- a formal reading of charges by the court and , frequently , the entering of a plea by the defendant -- had been scheduled for friday after judge @entity105 ruled thursday that prosecutors had provided sufficient evidence in the preliminary hearing for the case to proceed to trial			0
@entity105 said he was concerned @entity11 's case could be appealed if he moved too quickly with the arraignment			0
during that step , now scheduled for march 12 , the list of charges against @entity11 will be read , and he will have an opportunity to enter a plea , @entity111 district attorney @entity110 told reporters			0
@entity0 's @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
