@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 journalist recently freed in a @entity6 military operation described his @entity8 hostage - takers as " hopelessly inept , " and praised his @entity0 colleague who died in the rescue			1
journalists carry flowers to the grave of @entity0 journalist @entity14 in @entity1 on thursday			1
@entity16 reporter @entity15 described his four days in captivity in a blog on the newspaper 's web site , posted late wednesday just hours after he was freed			1
@entity8 militants kidnapped @entity15 and @entity0 journalist , @entity14 , on saturday			1
during a pre-dawn raid wednesday , @entity6 's @entity23 plucked @entity15 to safety , but did not retrieve the body of @entity14 , who died during a fierce firefight between troops and @entity8 militants			1
a @entity4 commando was also killed , as were a woman and child			1
there has been criticism about the rescue operation as well as the initial decision to go into the region which @entity15 points out in his blog , " was becoming more troubled by insurgents			2
" international troops , including @entity4 forces , have expressed their unhappiness about having to extract a @entity43 journalist from the area , a @entity43 military source in @entity1 told @entity2			1
meanwhile , @entity6 has come under fire from a coalition of @entity0 journalists working for foreign news outlets who called the pre-dawn raid " reckless and double - standard behavior			1
" the @entity54 of @entity0 issued a statement thursday saying it " holds the international forces responsible for the death of mr. @entity14 because they resorted in military action before exhausting other nonviolent means			1
" " there is no justification for the international forces to rescue their own national , and retrieve the dead body of their own soldier killed in action , but leave behind the dead body of @entity14 in the area			1
the @entity70 deems this action as inhumane			0
" @entity4 prime minister @entity75 intends to send a " private " letter of condolences to @entity14 's family , a spokeswoman for his office told @entity2			2
in his first - hand account of the kidnapping , @entity15 praised @entity14 for " trying to protect me up to the last minute			1
" the two had gone from @entity1 to the northern @entity0 city of @entity83 on friday to investigate reports of a @entity6 airstrike in a @entity8 - controlled area			1
@entity15 said he and his colleagues believed the attack , which destroyed two tankers , would be " a major controversy involving allegations of civilian deaths against @entity6 claims that the dead were @entity8			1
" he said they took precautions , including waiting until the next day to drive along the main highway in daylight			0
while they were interviewing locals about what happened along the riverbank , @entity15 said " a crowd began to gather , time passed , and we grew nervous			2
" " i do not know how long we were there , but it was uncomfortably long , " he said			0
" i am comfortable with the decision to go to the riverbank , but fear we spent too long there			0
" all of a sudden , some of the villagers shouted , " @entity8 " and their driver fled with the keys , he said			2
@entity15 and @entity14 tried to escape too , but they were captured			2
@entity14 was struck with a @entity117 rifle , but @entity15 said apart from that incident , the two were not " subjected to any beatings , torture or ill - treatment over the next four days			1
" their @entity8 captors operated freely in the area southwest of @entity83 , and appeared to be the only armed presence , @entity15 wrote			1
" it became a tour of a @entity8 - controlled district of @entity0 , and that control appeared total , " he said			1
" at no point did we see a single @entity6 soldier , @entity0 policeman , soldier or any check to the @entity8 's ability to move at will			1
" @entity15 said he and @entity14 were " paraded " around by their captors			2
" we were paraded to the children in the street : the infidel and his translator , to be laughed at and mocked , " he wrote			0
the captors operated with relative impunity and , at times , " their operational security was hopelessly inept " -- using @entity15 's name over their mobile phones " heedless of who was , almost certainly , monitoring the calls			1
" they even played songs on the radio that praised the @entity8 , he said			2
" they were not making it hard , " @entity15 wrote			2
at one point , he said they drove near what they said were watchtowers , manned by the @entity0 government and @entity6 , " gleeful at their daring			1
" " they drove with headlights full on at night as they moved us from house to house , at least three different buildings a day , " according to @entity15			2
he said the @entity8 captors seemed to be welcomed by some @entity0 villagers , while others appeared " more wary and formally polite			1
" during their captivity , @entity15 said " there were good hours , and bad ones , " as well as " progress and setbacks			2
" it became harder for the captors to find safe houses , he said			0
on the third night , there was what appeared to be an attempt to free them , but their captors took them to another refuge within minutes			0
then , on the next night , the aerial activity increased and their @entity8 captors grabbed their weapons and headed outside -- leaving @entity15 and @entity14 behind			1
they ran out later , @entity14 in front , and then became separated			0
then , @entity14 appeared again , holding out his hand to steady a faltering @entity15 and they ran across a narrow ledge on the outer wall of the compound			2
" i could hear @entity8 voices shouting and shooting from trees to our left , i thought , " @entity15 wrote			1
" i could also hear indistinct voices ahead			0
we continued 20 yards along the wall until it suddenly reached the corner			0
" @entity14 walked beyond that corner , out into the open , raising his hands and shouting , " journalist			0
" " there was a burst of gunfire and he went down immediately , " @entity15 wrote			0
" in the dark , with firing all around , trees everywhere and my view obscured by him and the wall , i did not know whether the bullets came from in front , to his right or to his left			0
" at the sound of gunfire , @entity15 reared back and dived into a wet ditch			0
after a few minutes , he heard @entity4 - accented voices and then screamed , " @entity4 hostage , " flashing a camera light from the ditch			1
he said he told the soldiers that @entity14 was lying behind him , and had possibly been shot			0
" the body was lying motionless in the ditch where i had seen him go down , " @entity15 said			0
" i hoped he had dropped and was lying still			0
i knew it was n't the case			0
" the soldiers told him that " they had his picture and would look for him , then dragged me away			0
" " it was over , " he wrote			0
he had died trying to help me , right up to the very last seconds of his life			0
" @entity15 said he was then taken onboard the aircraft , as the soldiers , most of them @entity4 , carried on some celebrations			1
but they fell silent after learning one of the rescuers died from the wounds sustained in the raid			0
" his blood - soaked helmet was in front of me throughout the flight , " @entity15 wrote			2
" i thanked everyone who was still alive to thank			0
it was n't , and never will be , enough			0
" @entity2 's @entity251 in @entity1 , @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
