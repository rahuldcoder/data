-- @entity4 coach @entity3 considered faking an injury to one of his players during saturday 's 9 - 8 @entity9 semifinal defeat to @entity10 , the @entity2 - born coach revealed at a press conference tuesday			1
@entity4 had already lost prop @entity12 to injury before being reduced to 14 men when captain @entity15 was issued a red card after 18 minutes , following a dangerous tackle on @entity10 wing @entity18			1
@entity3 , 48 , admitted the @entity4 coaching staff discussed feigning an injury to one of their props in the wake of @entity15 's dismissal , a move which would have meant scrums were uncontested for the remainder of the contest			1
" we had already lost @entity12 , " said former @entity2 hooker @entity3			2
" and we discussed in the box , did we fake an injury to one of our props to go to uncontested scrums			0
@entity10 beat 14 - man @entity4 to reach @entity9 final " but morally , i made the decision that was n't the right thing to do			1
we could 've easily done that in the first 25 , 30 minutes of the game			0
" but in the spirit of the game , the spirit of a @entity9 semifinal , i did n't think that was the fairest or the right thing to do			2
" @entity3 also disputed the decision to issue @entity15 , 23 , with a red card , only the second of the tournament so far , in such a crucial match			1
" i honestly believe @entity54 ( the @entity55 match referee ) made the wrong decision			0
i think the right decision was a yellow card			0
" in terms of the rules and the regulations , he 's perfectly entitled to give a red card but every game is different			1
you 've got to take circumstances , the situation , the intent ... given his experience , a yellow card was the right decision to make			0
" rugby union 's governing @entity2 down @entity73 in last - four clash despite @entity4 ' defeat , @entity3 reaffirmed his commitment to the country after reports in the @entity80 press suggested he could replace 2003 @entity9 winner @entity81 as @entity83 coach			1
" i 'll be honest , at some stage in your rugby career , as i 'm a @entity90 , i 'd like to come home and do a bit of coaching in @entity2 , " @entity3 , who is contracted to @entity4 until the end of 2015 , told the tournament 's official website			1
" but not at the moment and i have made that commitment to @entity4			0
we feel like we 've shown a lot of character , we feel like we 've played some great rugby since we 've been here			0
" we 'll leave here with our heads held high having earned a lot of respect			0
" wales face two - time world champions @entity73 in the bronze medal match on friday , after the @entity73 were beaten 20 - 6 by hosts @entity2 in the second semifinal on sunday			2
@entity15 will miss the clash at @entity111 's @entity110 , with prop @entity112 set to replace him as @entity4 captain			2
@entity12 also misses out due to the injury he picked up during saturday 's loss , with @entity116 set to cover at prop			2
