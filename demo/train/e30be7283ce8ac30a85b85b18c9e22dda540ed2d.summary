-- from @entity3 's silkscreens of @entity4 to @entity6 's nudes , it has generally been easier for women to be the subject of paintings than to have their own work exhibited			1
in 1989 , when @entity13 feminist collective @entity11 began counting how many works in @entity13 's @entity15 were by women , less than 5 % of the artists in its modern section were female			1
but the art world looks set to change its stubbly face , and shows increasing signs of recognition for the value and stature of leading female artists			1
half of the nominees for @entity30 's @entity29 are women this year , as are three of the four photographers shortlisted for @entity34 's $ 50,000 @entity33 , and at this month 's @entity37 , two of the five artists commissioned to make site - specific works were women			1
the chief curators of @entity41 , the @entity42 , the @entity15 , the @entity43 and the @entity44 are all female , as are the directors of @entity30 and the @entity46			0
the world 's biggest buyer of contemporary art , according to @entity50 is the @entity52 royal family , whose purchases are directed by @entity54			1
" it is better than it has ever been for women at the emerging level , " says one of the founders of @entity11 , @entity55			0
but , she warns , " when one travels up the art world ladder of success , there is a crushing glass ceiling			0
women only get so far , especially at the level of economics			0
" historically , art made by women has struggled to fetch high prices at auction			1
so much so , that earlier this year , renowned art dealer @entity72 told @entity73 that " women artists are the bargains of our time			2
" in @entity80 's @entity13 's september 2002 auction of post-war and @entity81 , female artists comprised 15 % of the lots auctioned , and only 10 % of the total sales			1
almost decade later at the same auction , in september 2011 , works by women accounted for 22 % of the lots auctioned , and 36 % of the $ 8.4 million taken			1
instead of being clumped around the bottom of the results table , four of the top 10 most expensive works were by women , including @entity93 installation artist @entity92 , sculptors @entity94 and @entity96 , and expressionist painter @entity97			1
by medium @entity97 's inclusion is especially heartening because , with its centuries of tradition as the purview of men , gender bias seems more entrenched in painting than in other media			0
when @entity13 critic @entity108 took up @entity11 ' cause in 2007 , criticizing @entity41 's male - heavy collection as tantamount to " apartheid , " he did note that it was exhibiting " excellent groupings of work by women " from its photography and drawing collections , and that " the film - and - video and prints departments have long been virtually gender - blind			2
" that notion appears to be borne out by the entry of female art stars into the very uppermost echelons of printmaking , sculpture and photography			2
until last november , @entity127 held the record for creating the world 's most expensive photograph			2
in the last decade , women have painted precisely none of @entity80 's @entity134 's 100 most expensive paintings but they created three of its most expensive prints ; five of its most expensive photos ( four were by @entity139 ) , and six of the 100 most expensive sculptures			1
the highest price paid for a female artwork was for @entity94 ' 1996 bronze sculpture " @entity145 , " which sold for $ 10.7m last year			0
digital revolution @entity148 , @entity149 representative for @entity150 , which provides pricing services for collectors , says when it comes to gauging the importance of women in the contemporary art market , auction turnover might not even tell the full story			1
" the majority of the best of @entity149 contemporary art does not have the opportunity to appear at auction -- it is sold through galleries , " he says , noting that sculptor and @entity29 winner @entity164 has 191 auction lots logged with @entity150 , " but the vast majority are multiple editions			1
" one potentially democratizing force in the art market could come from online sales			2
collectors can now shop for art online at e-commerce sites such as @entity175 which sells limited - edition prints for under $ 1,000 , @entity177 , which carries selections curated by guests such as performance artist @entity180 , and @entity181 , a search engine that connects buyers with galleries			1
three of @entity175 's top 10 sellers are women -- former @entity188 guitarist @entity187 , @entity189 , and @entity190 who sold out one edition in an hour			2
co-founder @entity192 believes online sales " bring the decision making to the public based on imagery , and away from the hands of the male - dominated traditional art world			2
" @entity177 cofounder @entity199 says female artists make up around a quarter of paddle 8 's sales activity , and has noticed particularly strong interest in established artists such as @entity127 , @entity205 and @entity206			1
while @entity181 is still in beta mode , it says nearly half of its sales so far have been of works by female artists			1
getting collected , displayed , reviewed of course , there are other indicators of success in the art world besides sales figures			0
solo shows , when a gallery throws a great deal of its resources and floor space behind a single name , are one way to gauge the esteem in which an artist is held			0
of five @entity13 museums tracked by the @entity11 between 2005 and 2011 , 28 % of @entity41 's solo shows and 16 % of the @entity15 's were by women			2
the @entity231 in @entity13 , founded in 1977 by former @entity42 curator @entity232 , had the most diverse roster , with 46 % of its solo shows devoted to female artists			1
this year , it has surveyed knitting , painting @entity239 artist @entity238 ( " enfant terrible " of " a @entity239 art scene dominated by male stars " , according to the @entity243 ) and has also put on feminist artist @entity245 's first solo show			0
and , besides touting emerging and established female artists , it also manages to include a healthy number of women in its retrospectives : eight of the 23 artists ( 35 % ) in a current exhibition about the 1970s and ' 80s @entity256 scene are female			1
" women have much better chances today , not only on the price circuit in the art market , but also to be collected , to be reviewed , " says @entity257 , director of @entity259 in @entity260 , and a judge of this year 's @entity29			2
some museums have initiatives dedicated to increasing the number of women artists in their collections , including the @entity271 in @entity272 , the @entity273 in @entity134 , and @entity274 ' @entity44			0
but @entity257 says the female directors she knows tend to be innately aware of striking a balance anyway			0
" when i do my year 's program , i never check if it 's half women , half men , " she says , " but if i check it through the years , it 's even , intuitively			0
i had one year when everyone was telling me ' what a great program , all these fantastic women			0
' i did n't do it on purpose			0
for me , it 's organic			0
" if lingering economic disparity remains at auction , @entity257 says it is not something preoccupying today 's female artists , many of whom consider themselves post-feminist			1
" they know the importance of it but they do n't like to stress it anymore , because if you stress it , it opens up that something 's missing , " she says			0
" they just want to play the game on the same level , and you can only play the game on the same level if you do n't unmask that something 's missing			0
" " @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 acted this way and have been interesting role models in this			0

at @entity80 's last contemporary art auction , four of the 10 most expensive works were by women
nearly a quarter of all lots were by female artists , who accounted for 36 % of total sales
e-commerce sites also report steady sales of art by women
