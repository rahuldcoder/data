-- only a few hours had passed after the @entity1 , which killed three people and injured hundreds , when this little nugget of inspiration showed up in my @entity7 feed : " back home			2
you know what ? i 'm going for a run			1
" that tweet is from @entity15 , a writer who was at the marathon when the bombs went off			1
luckily , as he writes on his blog , he was far enough from the blasts to be safe			2
as the hours went by i started to see more online posts like that -- runners in @entity24 and elsewhere making pledges to lace up their sneakers and hit the road			1
it felt like a groundswell of grass - roots action , a collective statement that this tragedy , no matter who perpetrated it or why , was n't going to stop people from doing what they love			2
@entity38 : run for @entity24 2014 by tuesday , people from @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49 were using the hashtag # runforboston and a @entity52 doc created by @entity54 @entity53 to log their journeys			1
the momentum has been building			2
as of early tuesday afternoon , 360 people had logged more than 1,200 running miles on @entity53 's page			2
people also have been sharing their stories with her			2
" i ran to clear my head , but it did n't work			0
so i ran because i could			0
because the freedom of running was n't taken away from me			0
because the running community stretches to all cities and all places , and i 'm glad to be a part of it , " one person wrote to @entity53 , a 26 - year - old in @entity69 , @entity70			1
i heard these stories and got inspired			0
that 's why i 'm pledging to run a marathon in honor of @entity24 -- and , since i 'm kind of a couch potato , i 'm going to pledge to do it by april 15 , 2014 , the 1 - year anniversary of the tragedy			1
i 'd like to invite you to do the same			0
sign up by going to the " @entity88 " page on @entity38 and uploading a photo of you and your running shoes			1
alternatively , post the photo to @entity94 or @entity7 with the hashtag # runforboston and # cnnireport			1
if you 're so inclined , tell us why you 're running			0
you do n't have to pledge to run a marathon			1
run a mile or a @entity100 -- or do a walk			1
the important thing is to get out there and get moving			0
do it for your health			0
or , if you use the simple app called @entity108 , you can do it to raise money for one of the several worthy charities it features			0
i 'm doing it because i feel like i 've got to do something			1
it 's been 12 years since 9/11 and 18 years since the @entity118 bombing			1
i was safely miles away , in a middle school classroom , when a bomb exploded in downtown @entity118 , killing 168			0
but that morning is stuck in my memory forever			0
i 'm running because i do n't want any of these tragedies to change me or to change us as a people -- to make us afraid , to keep us indoors			1
i am by no means a regular runner -- or even a runner at all			0
one of my friends saw a post about this idea on @entity130 and thought i was joking			0
so please do n't feel shy about signing up to do something new			0
i have no idea what i 'm getting myself into -- and i think that 's probably a good thing , at least for now			2
@entity0 also hopes to make a video about the collective journey -- and i 'm running to see what it will be like to ( hopefully ) complete this challenge as a group			1
i could go on , but instead i 'm going to go take a photo with my sneakers			2
and then hit the sidewalk			0
i hope you 'll do the same			0
