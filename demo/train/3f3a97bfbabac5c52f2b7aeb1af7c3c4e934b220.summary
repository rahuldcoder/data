-- the fertilizer blamed for the massive explosion that devastated a @entity4 town in april was kept in wooden bins , in a wooden building , with no sprinklers nearby			1
and that fell within the existing safety rules for handling ammonium nitrate , a " patchwork " of regulations , recommendations and guidance " that has many large holes , " the head of the @entity9 told a @entity18 committee thursday			0
the federal agency has n't found any regulations " that prohibit or discourage many of the factors that likely contributed " to the april 17 explosion in @entity25 , @entity4 , the board 's chairman , @entity26 , told the @entity28			1
a fire at the @entity30 led to an ammonium nitrate explosion that devastated the small town south of @entity33 and killed 15 people , most of them firefighters and paramedics			1
the blast showed up on seismographs as a small earthquake and flattened or damaged dozens of homes , two schools and a nursing home nearby			0
" @entity44 fall outside the existing process safety standards , which were developed in the 1990s , " @entity26 said			0
sprinklers are n't required until a company is storing 2,500 tons of ammonium nitrate , he said			1
and while industry groups have recommended fire safety standards , @entity4 has no statewide fire codes and most of its counties ca n't adopt their own			1
" so at @entity25 , these fire code provisions were strictly voluntary , and @entity30 had not volunteered , " he said			2
ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer with a notorious reputation as an explosive			0
the bomb used to blow up the federal building in @entity60 in 1995 , killing 168 people , was made mostly ammonium nitrate			0
@entity26 - @entity26 said the @entity9 urged the @entity63 in 2002 to require non-combustible storage bins for reactive chemicals like ammonium nitrate , but the @entity63 has n't done that			1
the committee 's chairwoman , @entity71 @entity70 sen. @entity68 , said she will be pressuring the @entity63 to enact those rules			1
" that was a very prescient call , and it did n't happen , " @entity68 told @entity73 , the head of the @entity63 's emergency response arm			1
the @entity63 's current guidance for handling ammonium ntirate dates back to 1997 , " and i feel that @entity63 has to step up to the plate here and do a lot more			1
" @entity73 said that guidance " is posted on our website now and continues to be vital			0
" and he told @entity68 the @entity63 is studying " a number of potential policy options " in response to the @entity25 disaster , but he would n't say when those steps would be taken			1
" in order to establish that time frame , we need to understand that issue better , and that 's what we 're doing now , " he said			2
@entity30 was covered under federal workplace safety rules for handling ammonium nitrate , @entity99 , a chemical engineering professor at @entity100 , told the committee			2
if they had followed those rules , " my guess is the probability of this incident would have been almost none , " he said			0
but the last time the @entity108 inspected @entity30 was in 1985 , when it fined the company $ 30 over its handling of anhydrous ammonia , another fertilizer it sold			2
" until we come up with a regime where we are doing the enforcement comprehensively , in a manner that yields good results , we 're not going to accomplish anything			0
we just add another legislation that does n't get enforced , " @entity99 said			0
with a budget of $ 10.6 million and a current staff of 42 , the @entity9 investigates chemical accidents and makes recommendations to prevent future ones			0
the board is also investigating the june 13 explosion at a chemical plant in @entity127 , @entity128 , that killed two people and injured more than 100			0
the agency has a lengthy backlog of cases and " no capacity at this point to undertake any new investigative work , " he said			0
@entity30 had been cited by federal regulators twice in the seven years before the blast , including a $ 5,250 fine for storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels			2
since the explosion , @entity4 officials have announced plans for an online database that will allow residents to view local facilities that hold hazardous materials			2
meanwhile , the town has sued the company that sold ammonium nitrate to @entity30 , arguing it " blindly " supplied the chemical to a firm that did n't handle it properly .			1

@entity30 did n't have to have *fireproof* bins or sprinklers , investigator says
the plant blew up in april , killing 15 and devastating a small @entity4 town
senator presses the @entity63 to do more ; @entity63 says it 's studying the issue
