last week 's presidential election should be a wake - up call to the @entity2 -- we can not afford to ignore a rising generation of 21st - century @entity5			1
going into the 2012 election , i worried that without effectively connecting with the youth vote , the @entity2 risked losing the millennial generation for the rest of their lives			1
on november 6 , we may have sealed our fate			0
that 's because partisan self - identification forms in new generations like cement -- setting softly and hardening over time			2
after three presidential elections cycles of voting for the @entity21 candidate , there 's a danger that millennials will vote blue from here on out			1
they broke for @entity27 in 2004 by 9 percentage points , for president @entity29 in 2008 by 34 percentage points , and again in 2012 , by a lesser 23 percentage points			1
republicans can take cold comfort in the fact that the surge in millennial support for @entity29 that @entity21 had hoped for in 2012 did n't turn up			1
the @entity37 estimates that about as many millennials voted in this election as the last one -- even though a whole new cohort of 18 - plus voters became eligible			2
opinion : my generation showed up as @entity2 pollster and millennial maven @entity49 points out , " young people are open to hearing a new message and new solutions			1
they did n't turn out in higher numbers for @entity29 this election than they did four years ago			1
but they have not warmed to the @entity2			2
we have not made the connection for why conservative principles are better for their future			0
" but there 's a silver lining , according to @entity49 : @entity62 improved with millennials more than any other age group over @entity66 's performance -- no other age group had such a dramatic swing			2
the problem , she acknowledges , is that it 's still not enough			0
@entity29 beat the @entity2 among youth by 4 more points than @entity73 and @entity74 won youth in their re-elections , each capturing the youth vote by 19 percentage points			1
for a generation whose enthusiasm has waned , winning the youth vote by 23 percentage points is still historic in modern @entity5 politics			1
@entity86 , filmmaker and author of the forthcoming book on millennials , " @entity90 : how the @entity92 , " tells me that " with sustained increased youth participation in 2004 , 2008 and now 2012 , it 's impossible to say that young people do n't show up to vote			1
we 've proved our political muscle			0
politicians have been able to get away with paying little attention to issues facing young @entity5 by invoking the argument that we do n't vote			2
now , they have no excuse not to address our concerns			0
... millennials take participating in politics seriously and see it as a real responsibility			2
" where are all the millennial feminists ? that 's why i 'm stubbornly optimistic as i look to the future			0
my @entity2 has no choice but to reach out to millennials			1
and when republicans sift through the exit polls , we will have to confront our demographic deficit with @entity119 , single women , non-churchgoers and centrist voters			0
but here 's the hidden good news -- if @entity2 aggressively reach out to millennials , they will find that they can begin to address all their problems in one fell swoop			1
because the character of the millennial generation embodies the demographic challenges facing the @entity2			1
the millennials are the most diverse , least traditional , least partisan generation alive today			0
they are 40 % nonwhite , and hispanics are the largest minority population within the age cohort			0
by supporting the @entity139 , which allows a pathway to citizenship for millennials who are in the @entity5 without authorization through no fault of their own , we reach out to both millennials and @entity135			0
only one quarter identify with organized religion , and they adhere least to traditional family structures			0
being the political party perceived as obsessed with limiting the rights of their gay friends is not a winning formula			0
millennials are concerned with national debt and the deficits			2
the message that previous administrations ' reckless spending -- republicans and @entity21 alike -- has amounted to " generational theft " that is compromising the millennial generation 's fiscal future can resonate			1
i had hoped that vice presidential nominee @entity167 would make it his mission to tour college campuses making an explicit generational appeal to millennials			0
this could be a winning issue for republicans to help bridge the divide , and while @entity167 did visit some universities , a consistent drumbeat by the @entity179 ticket to compete for the youth vote did not occur			0
it was a lost opportunity			0
it 's not just about social issues			0
even if the @entity2 were to embrace freedom to marry as being consistent with advancing individual freedom ( something i 'd love to see ) , we would not suddenly win over millennials			1
we need to make a compelling case for why conservatism can connect with this rising generation , explaining that our fiscal policies in particular will help build a more prosperous and less debt - ridden future for them and the country we all love			2
the 2020 election will be the first presidential race where all millennials will be of voting age -- with 90 million eligible voters ( as opposed to this year 's 64 million )			2
we may have failed to connect with this first wave of millennials , but there 's no excuse to miss the chance to connect with this rising generation now			0
the @entity2 can make itself competitive without compromising our core principles of individual freedom , fiscal responsibility , free markets and a strong national defense			1
we might have missed our chance in 2012 , but if we start now , the party , and the country will be better for it			1
a millennial says : stop trashing us !			0

@entity2 *consultant* @entity222 says her party missed the boat in 2012 with millennials

@entity2 *stances* on marriage and *immigration* turn away millennials , @entity231 says
@entity2 should *emphasize* its strong points -- fiscal conservatism , national defense
