@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 , who is battling brain cancer , is urging @entity5 officials to change a law to allow for an immediate temporary replacement should a vacancy occur for one of his state 's two @entity11 seats			1
sen. @entity2 , @entity5 , has championed universal health care for years			1
under a 2004 @entity5 law , a special election must be held 145 to 160 days after a @entity11 seat becomes vacant			1
the winner of that election would serve the remainder of a senator 's unexpired term			0
@entity2 , a @entity22 senator who has represented @entity5 for nearly 47 years , was re-elected in november 2006			1
his six - year term ends in january 2013			0
in a letter to @entity5 gov. @entity25 and other state leaders , @entity2 said he supports the current law , " [ b ] ut i also believe it is vital for this @entity29 to have two voices speaking for the needs of its citizens and two votes in the @entity11 during the approximately five months between a vacancy and an election			1
" @entity2 , 77 , asked the governor and state leaders to " amend the law through the normal legislative process to provide for a temporary gubernatorial appointment until the special election occurs , " according to the letter , dated july 2			1
read the letter ( @entity45 ) the letter was not sent until wednesday , however , in part because @entity2 has been dealing with the recent illness and death of his sister @entity50 , according to a source close to the senator			0
@entity2 , who had been having conversations with top state @entity22 about a potential succession , also was concerned that releasing the letter would disrupt @entity11 health care negotiations , another source close to the senator said			1
" he 's talking about his potential vacancy here , and the threat of @entity2 's vote on health care is a powerful incentive to get it done , " the source said in reference to the senator 's thinking over the past few weeks			1
" if the letter gets out , it could have a negative impact			0
" the reason @entity2 sent the letter this week was because the @entity74 learned about the discussions and was prepared to print what he thought was an inaccurate account of his efforts , both sources said			0
he therefore decided to make his desires clear by delivering the letter , knowing it would go public			0
one of the sources described how " tough " the letter was for @entity2 to write , acknowledging it is likely he soon will no longer be in the @entity11			2
the senator 's wife , @entity87 , has no interest in filling the seat , one of the sources said			0
@entity2 has held it since his first election in 1962			2
his brother , the late @entity93 , had a @entity11 seat for almost eight years before being elected to the presidency in 1960			1
democrats , in collaboration with independents sens. @entity97 of @entity99 , and @entity100 of @entity101 , control 60 votes in the @entity11 and face a tough battle this fall to overhaul health care			1
they have been trying to calculate votes without @entity2 , who has been unable to attend many sessions for months due to his illness			2
@entity2 has championed universal health care for years and wants to make sure @entity22 have the votes they may need for passage of a comprehensive bill			1
he has called the issue " the cause of his life			0
" at the @entity118 , he said he wants legislation that will " guarantee that every @entity121 ... will have decent , quality health care as a fundamental right			2
" in a statement , the governor , also a @entity124 , said , " it 's typical of @entity2 to be thinking ahead , and about the people of @entity5 , when the rest of us are thinking about him			2
" before 2004 , state law allowed the governor to appoint an immediate replacement in the event of a @entity135 vacancy			0
the heavily @entity22 @entity136 changed the law , however , after sen. @entity138 of @entity5 was expected to become the @entity22 presidential nominee			1
critics said the @entity136 changed the statute to prevent then - gov. @entity142 , a @entity143 , from picking a replacement for @entity138 in the event he defeated president @entity146 later that fall			0
" when this was an issue five years ago , republicans pushed for an interim appointment , but it was overwhelmingly rejected , " @entity147 said in a statement thursday			0
" out of political expediency and convenience , the @entity22 are again considering showing a complete disregard of the democratic process and the laws of the @entity29 by contemplating a change to the law to serve their partisan interests , as opposed to simply what is the best and most appropriate policy			2
" @entity2 is the second longest - serving member of the @entity11 , surpassed only by @entity124 @entity163 of @entity164			2
calculations on @entity11 votes this fall also have included @entity163 , who is 91			0
@entity1 's @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
