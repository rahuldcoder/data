the news that a large number of @entity2 , including several @entity3 , had become hostages in @entity5 shook the @entity3 once again out of the delusion that it is possible to turn away from the world 's problems			1
many @entity3 would like nothing better than to forget about the rest of the planet and focus on all the challenges crying for attention at home			1
after more than a decade of fighting costly and painful wars in faraway lands , people have grown weary , tired of worrying about complicated conflicts that seem to have no connection to their own lives			0
but then bad things happen			0
read more : power struggle : the @entity5 gas industry targeted by militants on wednesday , in a dramatic operation in @entity32 's portion of the @entity33 , @entity28 militants in the desert attacked a convoy of oil workers -- the people who work to satisfy the world 's need for fuel			1
the jihadists claimed to have captured more than 40 hostages , including @entity3 , @entity42 , @entity43 and others			2
the @entity3 called the incident a " terrorist " attack , and what followed has been the typical flurry of confusion -- possible escapes , killings			2
without a doubt , the families of the hostages are suffering unbearable anxiety			0
meanwhile , there is a war raging in @entity58 , neighbor to @entity32			1
until recently a democratic state , landlocked @entity58 is becoming home to terrorism , as @entity28 militants affiliated with @entity64 and its allies have been conquering the country and brutally subjugating the population in the process			1
@entity43 has just sent military forces to the country after a desperate plea from its president			0
fortified with weapons seized from the @entity75 war and emboldened by their unstoppable march across @entity58 , these militant groups have been growing stronger			1
@entity77 : prepare for refugee crisis in @entity58 the hostage emergency is only the most recent in a dramatic series of events occurring in @entity5 over many months			1
in this chaotic and fluid crisis , we hope the hostages will return safely to their families			2
but that will not end the bigger crisis in the region			0
while it unfolds , the rest of the world has to pay attention , whether it likes it or not			0
islamist militants , including @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , have operated in @entity32 and other parts of @entity5 for years , massacring civilians indiscriminately , taking countless @entity2 hostages , collecting ransom , and more importantly , seeking to overthrow existing governments and imposing their rule			1
in @entity32 , the government has the upper hand			1
but @entity58 has gone into free fall despite having served as a shining example of democracy in @entity106 , for decades a place of tolerance , art and culture			2
after separatist @entity114 rebels joined forces with @entity64 - linked militants , the country 's political system began to unravel			0
a military coup weakened government forces , and the insurgency pushed ahead , conquering the northern half of the country			2
people living in areas under @entity28 rule have endured floggings , amputations and public executions , according to human rights groups and witnesses			2
killings , rapes , torture and other crimes have prompted calls for the @entity135 to become involved			0
residents say the rebels have been buying children to use as soldiers			0
and they have engaged in the wholesale destruction of the ancient treasures of the city of @entity143 , a world heritage site , much as the @entity145 did when they conquered @entity146 and blew up the ancient @entity148 statues in @entity149			0
the @entity150 warns that hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes and millions more are at risk of running out of food in the @entity155 , the area bordering the @entity33 , which is experiencing a severe drought			0
as the rebels entrench their position , they build a stronghold in a part of the world where institutions are fragile and people are vulnerable			2
the conflict may be local , but the rebels ' ideology considers the @entity106 the enemy , and non-muslims as well as moderate @entity171 fair game for their brutality			0
it 's been almost a year since the @entity150 , the @entity3 , @entity174 and @entity5 's leaders agreed that the international community urgently need to lend a hand to the embattled government and people of @entity58			1
world leaders met , argued , discussed and did essentially nothing			0
that 's when the rebels launched an advance toward the capital , @entity186 , and @entity58 's president sent out an sos to @entity189 and the @entity150 @entity43 , a former colonial power , mobilized its military and launched bombing raids and sent in troops			2
@entity43 has deep connections with @entity58 , @entity32 and other former colonies			1
thousands of @entity43 citizens live there , and personal and business connections run deep			0
the military operation , launched by @entity43 's @entity200 president @entity199 , has strong support at home , at least so far			0
the hostage - takers in @entity32 claim their attack on the foreign oil workers was retaliation for @entity43 's intervention and for @entity32 's granting permission for military overflights			1
but experts say the militants ' attack was too sophisticated , probably planned well before @entity189 became involved with @entity58			1
more likely , the @entity32 hostage crisis signals that @entity28 extremists and dangerous gangs are gaining ascendancy in that part of the world , a region that is remote but crucial			1
it is a part of @entity5 at the intersection of the @entity222 world -- of enormous strategic importance to the @entity106 -- and the @entity106 heartland , a region only now becoming more stable after years of unspeakable human tragedy			2
we may want to avert out eyes , worry about the problems at home , and think this one , too , can be " kicked down the road , " to use the term fashionable for explaining inaction on domestic matters			0
but some problems become much worse if ignored			0
the hostage crisis is a warning that militants must be pushed back			1
without sending @entity3 troops into combat , the @entity3 should provide greater support to the @entity43 and other @entity5 governments in helping @entity58 to defeat the @entity28 militants and return democracy to @entity58			1
the last thing the people of @entity58 and the @entity106 want is a gang of @entity64 - affiliated @entity28 militants in charge of an entire country			1
we 've already seen that once before , and it did n't end well for anyone .			0
