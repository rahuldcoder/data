@entity10 , @entity11 -- " he did n't want carpets , he preferred to hear footsteps of people as they approached on the wooden parquet flooring , " says @entity0 , the tour guide , as she explains another interior - design quirk of one of the most morbidly fascinating personalities of the 20th century			1
it 's fair to say @entity14 , the notorious dictatorial leader of the @entity15 , still holds a curiosity for many			1
the @entity18 native helped create much that is modern @entity10 , the host of the @entity21 , when he built his summer retreat in this town in 1937			1
the retreat is open to visitors and will soon offer rooms to guests this summer for 7,000 roubles ( $ 200 ) per night			2
welcome to the home of @entity14			1
benefiting from the cool , restorative mix of sea and mountain air streams , the villa -- or " dacha , " as it 's known locally -- was situated for the health - giving nature of its surroundings			1
nestled in the coniferous , cypress - tree forest of the @entity42 mineral springs area and perched in the foothills of the @entity44 , it was seen as the ideal refuge to replenish the man whose day job was ruling over 200 million people			2
follow @entity12 's live @entity21 coverage it also has a rather snazzy green exterior			2
" the color is the same as the trees , it camouflages the building , " adds @entity0 -- another handy feature for a property if you have many enemies			2
for guests staying over , the facilities do n't compare well to the luxurious standards of comfort demanded by modern national leaders			2
the interiors of every room consist of uniform beechwood paneling devoid of decoration			0
portraits of @entity14 that adorn the walls and the fireplace were hung there long after his demise , such was his dislike of them			1
there 's a swimming pool , so small it more closely resembles an oversized sunken bath , where the @entity80 chief enjoyed walking ( he could n't swim ) in seawater up to his shoulders			2
there are also fantastic views of the @entity85 , which laps against the shore a few miles away			0
entertainment is basic , especially given the cinema room where @entity14 used to view his favorite @entity90 movies is no longer functioning , but there is a billiards room with the original table and cue used by the man dubbed " @entity14			1
" and in a break with tradition of museums around the world , visitors can use both to try to pot balls in the small @entity11 - standard pockets			0
however , there is one word of warning : if you 're considering a stay it 's probably wiser to visit in the summer			1
the property walls are a secure 70 centimeters thick and , on @entity14 's orders , the house has no heating			1
that accounts for the cool temperatures in the majority of rooms @entity12 visits			0
but it remains a mystery why the temperature drops five degrees in @entity14 's cinema , where his waxwork sits ominously behind a desk in front of copies of @entity125 and opposite a bullet - proof sofa			1
our guide denies the presence of the rumored ghost of @entity14 : " no , absolutely no. it is cold because of the architecture			1
( the thick walls ) are very difficult to warm up			0
of course now it is cold in the dacha , but it 's very pleasant to stay there in summer			1
" it was designed by architect @entity139 , to whom @entity14 made only one request for the building : no fountains			1
a direction that required a swift alteration to the original water feature that sat in the middle of the central courtyard into a flowerbed			0
despite the dacha 's peculiarities , though , the presence of the leader of the @entity15 in such a small coastal resort had a seismic effect in the town now being viewed on televisions across the world			1
" no doubt that when our leader began to visit @entity10 , the city benefited from great development , " @entity0 says			1
" earlier our city was the resort for the nobility , for only rich people			0
there had been tourists ' villas long before @entity14 came here			1
" but when @entity14 began to visit @entity10 , he began to develop it as a resort town for all people			1
thanks to him , a lot of sanatoriums and hydropathic establishments ( and ) a road to @entity42 were built			2
all in all , he did really much for the development of @entity10			1
" ironic then that the town @entity14 " built " was the one chosen by president @entity180 , who also has a summer house in @entity10 , to represent the modern face of @entity11 to the world			1
local journalist @entity184 edits the independent " @entity187 , " a forum he has used to reflect the positive and negative sides of @entity10 hosting the @entity190 , much to the ire of @entity11 officials			1
" first of all i see it from the city 's point of view and how the infrastructure is being developed			0
but there are negative sides , too ... we had a huge beach with 70 meters covered with pebble , a beautiful seafront , but now ( as a result of development ) there is no beach			0
the ecology and nature was damaged greatly , " @entity184 told @entity12			0
the choice may be seen as shrewd if costly politicking by some , but for @entity0 , @entity10 seemed like the obvious and most welcome choice to host the @entity21			2
" with the @entity190 , @entity10 has received a great new development			2
for example , the new buildings were built , even the image of the city has changed			0
we could compare the current policy with @entity14 's one , " she says			1
" i was not surprised because our city is really unique			0
thanks to our mild climate you can relax here all year round , even in winter			0
so it was quite logical and natural , " the guide tells @entity12 as we view the pictures of @entity14 's family on show in the fridge - like cinema room			1
there is a black and white image of his second wife @entity234 , who died young -- officially from appendicitis amid rumors of suicide			0
there 's also pictures of his son @entity241 , who did not survive internment in a @entity245 prisoner of war camp			0
the smiling faces in the photos do not convey the whole picture , according to @entity0			0
" generally , he liked to be all alone			0
he loved his wife @entity234 and his children			0
he read and thought a lot			0
he grew lemons ( for medicinal drinks )			0
so he was an unsociable man , i think			0
" @entity0 says there is no shortage of interest in the dacha			0
she thinks attitudes toward @entity14 are as varied as the visitors to the site ; some consider him a great politician , many consider him a dictator and treat him a little " disdainfully			2
" however , one factor that shows no sign of changing is the restorative powers @entity10 offers to the political elite .			2
