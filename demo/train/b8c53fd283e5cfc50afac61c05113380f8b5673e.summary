com ) -- despite the departure of star @entity4 and director @entity5 , the " @entity2 " franchise still ruled the box office this weekend			1
" @entity14 , " @entity8 's $ 125 million sequel / reboot , which stars @entity10 as a new ( but similarly brainwashed ) secret agent , topped the chart with an estimated $ 40.3 million from 3,745 locations			1
the action film debuted higher than franchise launchpad " @entity17 , " which grossed $ 27.1 million in its 2002 opening weekend , but it will need solid word of mouth ( which may not be merited by its lukewarm " b " @entity20 grade ) to match that film 's $ 121.7 million finish			1
" legacy " was unable to reach the heights of its two predecessors , though			0
" @entity31 " started with $ 52.5 million on the way to $ 176.2 million , and 2007 ′ s " the @entity30 " started with $ 69.3 million en route to a $ 227.5 million finish			2
the past year has been a great one for @entity10 , who nabbed roles in back - to - back blockbusters " @entity35 : @entity36 " and " @entity37 , " and while the opening of " @entity26 " is another solid notch on his belt , it still does n't prove definitively that he is a real box office draw			1
the original " @entity2 " trilogy earned the franchise a tremendous amount of goodwill from audiences , and it 's that franchise trust that likely benefited " @entity26 " ( and " @entity35 , " and " @entity37 " ) more than @entity10 's presence			0
whether the formidable actor can pull in audiences on his own remains to be seen			0
will @entity51 and @entity52 ' election comedy " @entity53 " took second place with $ 27.4 million			1
the r - rated laugher kicked off its run in the same range as @entity51 's last live - action wide release " @entity59 " ( $ 35.5 million ) , and @entity52 ' last non- " @entity61 " comedy " @entity62 " ( $ 32.7 million )			1
while " the campaign 's " grosses are a bit lower than those movies ( and recent r - rated hit " @entity68 , " which opened with $ 36.1 million ) , the debut frame is remarkably impressive considering the subject matter			2
@entity71 audiences have never been particularly receptive to political comedies			0
" @entity73 : @entity76 " ( 2004 ) has found a huge cult following , but it earned just $ 32.8 million in its theatrical run			2
" @entity80 " ( 2006 ) gave the " @entity78 " format a political spin , but it topped off at $ 7.2 million			1
political tales " @entity82 " ( 2006 ) and " @entity83 " ( 2008 , an election year ) , grossed only $ 37.3 million and $ 16.3 million , respectively			1
the highest grossing political comedy in recent memory is actually @entity88 's " @entity87 , " which was widely perceived as a misfire when it earned $ 59.7 million against a rumored $ 100 - plus million budget and massive advertising campaign			1
political storylines simply do n't offer audiences the escapism they typically desire at the movies , but between the interest in politics now that we 're in the middle of election season , combined with @entity51 and @entity52 ' undeniably silly personas , which do n't suggest a serious political point - of - view , " @entity53 " clicked for ticket buyers , and it will become a solid hit for both actors			1
time will tell how high the film actually climbs , though its unenthusiastic " b - " cinemascore grade may limit endurance			0
due to heavy competition , @entity113 ' other big release , " @entity114 , " slipped into third place with $ 19.5 million , a 45 percent drop from last weekend			1
after four frames , @entity120 's $ 250 million @entity119 finale has soared to $ 390.1 million , and it will pass " @entity123 ' " $ 407.3 million cume to become 2012 ′ s second - highest - grossing domestic performer next weekend			2
( it 's already achieved this title worldwide			0
) in fourth place was " @entity128 , " the @entity131 / @entity130 dramedy ( which also stars @entity132 as their marriage therapist ) , which earned $ 15.6 million over the friday - to - sunday period in 2,361 theaters			1
prospects looked somewhat grim for " @entity137 " when it earned a quiet $ 4.5 million over wednesday and thursday , but the film 's overwhelmingly older female audience ( 66 percent were women , 69 percent were 40 or older ) , who are n't all relaxing on their summer breaks , turned out in higher volumes for weekend engagements			2
after five days , the film , which was issued a " b " cinemascore grade , has earned $ 20.1 million			2
@entity147 paid just $ 15 million to acquire " @entity128 " from @entity148 , who shelled out $ 29 million to produce the film , and if it proves as leggy as some of @entity131 's other films — " @entity153 " climbed to $ 94.1 million after a $ 20 million weekend , and " it 's complicated " earned $ 122.7 million after a $ 22.1 million debut -- it will become a profitable mid-level hit for the studios			2
" @entity157 : @entity161 " rounded out the top five , dropping 44 percent to $ 8.2 million , which lifts the kiddie flick 's total to $ 30.6 million after ten days			0
its predecessor , " @entity157 : @entity167 , " had earned $ 38.2 million at the same point in its run , but that film started with $ 23.7 million , while " @entity161 " started with just $ 14.6 million — a difference of $ 9.1 million			0
fortunately , strong summer weekday performances have helped " @entity161 " close the difference to $ 7.6 million , and the $ 22 million @entity171 film could finish with about $ 45 million			0
also of note : last weekend 's top opener , " @entity172 " plunged 68 percent to $ 8.1 million in its sophomore frame , and has now earned only $ 44.2 million against its $ 125 million budget			0
" @entity14 " -- $ 40.3 million 2			1

" @entity114 " -- $ 19.5 million 4			1
