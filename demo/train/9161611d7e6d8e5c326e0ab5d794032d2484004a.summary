-- for some , the name " @entity2 " conjures images of people wearing tricorner hats and churning butter			1
for others , the name brings images of people wearing skinny jeans and churning organic butter			1
the former are thinking of @entity2 , @entity11 , a popular family vacation spot whose slogan is " the future may learn from the past			1
" the latter are thinking of @entity2 , @entity17 , a popular liberal arts grad landing spot whose slogan could be " past : it 's me , not you ; @entity23 , the future			1
" full - throated endorsements of @entity2 , @entity17 , are hard to come by			1
people find it too trendy or played out			1
press further , and critiques fall into two categories : 1 ) it used to be cool , but now it 's filled with fauxhemians : middle - class post-college kids looking for la vie boheme			1
2 ) it 's exhibit a in the case against gentrification : affordable rent brought artists , artists brought poseurs , poseurs and artists made it hospitable for investment bank bachelors , all three groups raised rents and forced out the low - income population that lived there in the ' 70s			1
all of these complaints are right , of course , just as they would be in many places in @entity52			1
but they rest on one fundamental truth : people ( whether they 're your people or not ) find @entity2 attractive			1
on a recent visit , after being away for several years , i was reminded of why : it 's a vibrant little village that punches far above its weight culturally and culinarily			1
it teems with small businesses , and its streets are abustle , thick with beautiful youth in all manner of pomp			1
@entity66 might be inured to the charms of an " emerging " neighborhood , but to a visitor @entity2 , @entity17 , can be just as eccentric and strangely charming as that other @entity2			1
i was there to visit old friends , partially reformed rabble - rousers who once raised hell here but are raising a family now instead			1
they were running behind , so i decided to " flaneur " the 10 - block walk to their house			1
i began at @entity82 and @entity83 , the gritty heart of the neighborhood , where the @entity86 from @entity87 makes its first stop in @entity17			1
on some evenings , @entity83 can feel like @entity91 for hipsters -- a corridor of beer - breathed smokers moving from one bar to the next -- but it being early evening on a sunday , the debauch - o - meter was dialed down			2
my first stop was @entity98 and @entity99 , a beloved local bookstore that anchors a boutique mini-mall			2
browsers clogged the shop , perusing design magazines and scanning book titles			2
laptops remained sheathed in shoulder bags as people chicken - winged books and skimmed through literary journals			1
i bought a manual about how to be invisible that was written by a ninja			2
( i figured that after i read it i could just slip back into the store and take whatever other book i wanted			2
) @entity66 might take scads of robust independently owned stores in stride , but for @entity121 who have been chainstored over the past decade , it 's as much of a sight to behold as an open - air museum about colonial times			2
* @entity128 , like many of the shops in the neighborhood , is among the best in the country in what it does			2
same can be said for @entity132 , an instrument shop up the street			2
same with @entity135 , the local electronics shop			2
or the local bike shops			2
the " small businessmen " we hear so much about in election years are thriving in @entity2			1
when i left @entity128 , i crossed the street to @entity143 wines to pick up a house gift			2
( as the childless friend , it is my responsibility to bring the mischief			2
) @entity143 is just one of several small , competent liquor shops that litter the neighborhood			2
i bought a bottle and crossed the street again to buy socks ( i miscounted when packing for my trip ) at @entity155 @entity52 , a men 's clothing store			0
but i could have just as easily ventured to @entity158 or @entity159 , all smartly curated clothing shops within a few blocks			0
now carrying a ninja book , a bottle of wine and a pair of socks , i crossed the street again to visit @entity168			0
at @entity170 , you 're welcome to sample cheese to your partially clogged heart 's content , so that 's what i did			0
when i was done , i handed the clerk the bottle of wine i bought , told her how much i wanted to spend and was given two hunks of dairy wrapped in paper			0
a text from my friends ; they 're still not ready to receive visitors			1
so i forged ahead with my wine , my cheese , my socks and my ninja book in tow			0
i watched steam come off people 's heads as they left the @entity193 , an indoor public pool			1
in addition to the rec center , @entity2 has decently maintained baseball fields , tennis and bocce courts and a handsome track , the sort of public amenities that many towns can only dream about			1
they 're well - maintained remnants of a more optimistic time in @entity121			0
again , oddly wonderful for an outsider to see			0
once past the @entity193 , a little bar light caught my eye , so ... i crossed the street yet again			0
i found myself in @entity210 , a new bar made to look old			0
dim lights , bourgie cocktails , mounds of oysters , and within minutes i was behind a drink and slurping the briny insides of cold shells			0
looking around the horseshoe bar , i noticed that everyone else seemed to be taking this well - appointed , affordable bar in stride			0
@entity224 , on the other hand , was delighted with myself for stumbling across it			0
( i should n't have been ; @entity17 has a disproportionate amount of handsome drinking establishments : @entity228 and @entity229 , for two			1
) a burst on my phone reminded me it was time to push off , but before i reached my destination , i made one last stop at a new restaurant ( and there is always a new restaurant here ) named @entity239 stepping inside , i felt like i had entered @entity240			0
@entity241 , beards , a menu that looked like a flier for a psychedelic concert			0
i filed it away for another night			0
and then finally i made it to my friends ' apartment , a cozy rent - controlled two bedroom in a brownstone			0
as i unpacked my wine , my cheese , my socks and my ninja book ( none of which cost more than $ 12 , by the by ) and recounted how i spent my past hour , it occurred to me that there are n't many neighborhoods in @entity121 where i could have taken that walk			0
in less than a mile , i was able to survey a host of small pleasures			0
i met courteous shop owners who clearly dig their gigs			0
and i got an eyeful of stylish and attractive folks enjoying life 's rich pageant			0
do i want everywhere like this ? absolutely not , but i do n't have to worry about that			0
hardly anywhere is like this			0
i think people exhausted with @entity2 forget that			1
for those who have n't been , post-colonial @entity2 is worth a visit , and do n't worry , you wo n't offend the sensibilities of the cognosceti ; they 've already moved on to @entity285			1
* there is only one chain store on the @entity170 commercial district ; it 's a @entity290 drugstore that felt compelled to include a microbrew beer bar where locals can refill plastic to - go containers just to earn some street cred			0
the tactic worked a little bit , but locals still prefer the independently owned @entity299 across the avenue .			0

@entity2 , @entity17 , gets its fair share of criticism
some people find it too trendy or played out , but it still has a lot to offer
visitors are likely to experience it as eccentric and strangely charming
