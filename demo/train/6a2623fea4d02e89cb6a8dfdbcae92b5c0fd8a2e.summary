-- one reader called me in tears			0
the overwhelming message : what can we do to help low - income people in @entity10 , @entity11 , which has the highest income inequality of any county or parish in the country ? @entity0 featured @entity10 and @entity16 , the parish 's largest town , as part of the @entity20 project			1
it 's a place where about 40 % live in poverty and 16 % are unemployed			2
there 's wealth there , too , but it 's far from evenly distributed			2
much of the response was incredibly heartwarming and generous			0
it reminded me that this country does have the empathy and caring it needs to mend our economic divisions			0
" i just read portions of your story on @entity37 , " a prison guard who lives on the poorer side of @entity16 , " and i am moved to tears , " one reader said in an e-mail			1
" although i know that structural change is the only way to truly help people like her , is there a way for me to make a donation to her and her family ? " another wrote , " thank you for the enlightening story			2
i hope i can help some way			0
" and here 's an excerpt of what i think was the most powerful response , which i received by e-mail : " i watched this video and read the article this morning sitting in my 1,400 - square - foot house , on my @entity62			1
by the end i was bawling			0
my family is middle - class and we want for nothing			2
my husband and i are both college graduates , have great benefits , and our two young children have everything they need or want			0
... i have been one of those that bemoaned government assistance and had that ' bootstrap ' mentality			0
however , as your article suggests , how can that happen when there are places where there are no opportunities to be had ? " because so many of you asked how to help , i 've compiled a list of a few nonprofit organizations that are helping people find jobs , paying people 's electric bills and strengthening neighborhoods in the area			1
you can find that list below			0
there 's information , too , on how to contact @entity37 , the woman featured in the op - ed " the most unequal place in @entity100 " and the digital documentary " across @entity16			1
" i 'd also ask you to participate in @entity103 's " @entity104 " project			2
part of fixing @entity100 's income inequality problems is first acknowledging how wide the rich - poor gap has become			1
if you have any further questions or would like more information , please send me an e-mail or a message on @entity112			0
@entity113 @entity113 , based in nearby @entity114 , @entity11 , provides jobs training programs in @entity16 and surrounding communities			1
while i was in town , i met a woman who started her own restaurant in part because she was working with the group , and another man who was getting help with resumes and applying for work in the area			1
