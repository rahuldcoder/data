-- that sport has become a big business is a well - worn cliche			1
it also widely acknowledged that commercialism in sport is relatively recent phenomenon			1
fifty years ago the majority of sports were organized on amateur lines , and even in professional sports the sums of money at stake were negligible			1
commercial sport has become one of the most visible manifestations of globalization , with broadcasting and sponsorships turning clubs and players into vehicles for generating cash -- some consider them more brands than athletes			1
so how is all this working out -- for the sports organizations , the players , and the fans ? and in this time of crisis , what can this microcosm of capitalism teach the economics of the real world ? textbook economics teaches that woes of capitalism can be identified with two problems : the failure to achieve truly competitive markets and the manifest unreasonableness of the initial distribution of income			1
markets fail to be competitive because of various manifestations of monopoly power , often associated with superior access to relevant information , whereas efforts to improve the perceived fairness of the income distribution often conflict with the objective of improving economic efficiency			2
sports capitalism has some unique characteristics			1
first , monopoly will not work -- teams and athletes need sporting competitors			2
second , those competitors need to be genuine , in the sense that there is some degree of balance -- a predictable contest has limited entertainment value			2
there are essentially two approaches to organizing competition : the @entity72 model and the @entity74 model			1
the @entity72 model works like this			1
a collection of businessmen agree to found a league , each operating a franchise which is responsible for managing a team , securing a stadium and selling tickets			2
the league , meaning owners operating as a committee , manage several important issues centrally			2
typically , the broadcast rights are sold collectively , and often the merchandising rights too , with the money to be equally shared between the teams			0
visiting teams may be given a share of the gate			0
the league negotiates centrally with a players ' union , fixing both minimum and maximum salaries			2
no club is allowed to spend too much more than anyone else , and the weakest teams are typically rewarded with the first choice of new players entering the league ( the draft )			2
in essence , the league is run as a kind of socialist collective by the franchise owners			0
and this model has been colossally successful in generating profits over the last 50 years			2
in 2012 a study by @entity115 estimated the market value of the four major leagues ( @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 ) at $ 67 billion			0
the leagues argue that their success can be attributed to the rules which maintain balance among the teams			0
skeptics argue that the economic success derives from artificial scarcity ( entry into the majors is closely restricted ) and monopoly power ( these are the best leagues in the world in their sports -- the potential for new entrants to become rivals is negligible )			0
sports in @entity74 is dominated by soccer , which operates under a completely different business model			1
from an economic perspective there is free entry , in the sense that anyone can start a team and enter at the lowest league level , and then work their way to the top purely on sporting merit			0
this is because each league in a given country is connected to every other league through the promotion and relegation system			0
this specifies that at the end of the season the worst performing teams ( in sporting teams ) and sent down to play in the next league down ( relegation ) , whose best teams replace them ( promotion )			0
this fluidity promotes a kind of cutthroat competition , where collective agreements are very limited			0
the threat of relegation means that the strong are not willing to share with the weak			0
perhaps surprisingly , the @entity74 model is one of pure capitalist competition , red in tooth and claw			1
according to a study published by @entity182 , the @entity74 governing body of soccer , in 2012 , out of 700 clubs operating in the top divisions in @entity74 countries , 63 % reported an operating loss , 55 % reported a net loss , 38 % reported negative net equity and auditors raised " going concern " doubts in 16 % of cases			1
@entity74 leagues are also highly unequal in sporting terms , with a handful of clubs dominating competition at both national and @entity74 level			1
many believe that the system is not stable , and @entity182 has recently introduced regulations in order to achieve a less economically competitive environment			0
however , as a system @entity74 football has been remarkably stable , with few clubs being liquidated , and a succession of " sugar daddies " being willing to step in and finance loss making clubs because of the prestige that this brings			1
in both systems the players have done extremely well			1
in the @entity72 the unions have secured guaranteed percentages of league revenues , while in @entity74 open competition has ensured that wages have been bid up			1
top players earns tens of millions in salaries and even more from endorsements			2
almost every school age child nowadays yearns to be a top athlete			0
many people feel it unfair that nurses or firemen earn small salaries compared to sports stars , but their pay simply reflects scarcity			0
the best are able to perform athletically in ways that no else can , in order to win championships on which fans place enormous value			0
and do the fans do well ? it sometimes seems that the default mode of the fan is discontent , with a jealous eye constantly turned to past in which life was simpler and tickets were cheaper			0
there are constant scandals concerning the abuse of drugs , violence on and off the field , match fixing and gambling , exploitation of fans through ever increasing ticket prices			0
but the fact is that the universe of fans has expanded dramatically over the last fifty years , attendances have grown to unprecedented levels and broadcasting has ensured that any sporting event can be viewed anywhere in the world			0
in this sense at least , modern professional sport , whether along the social - democratic lines adopted in the @entity72 , or the bare - knuckle laissez version practised in @entity74 , must be considered one of the most successful manifestations of modern capitalism			1

sport is big business , but commercialism is a relatively recent phenomenon
sport capitalism comes in two models : that used in @entity72 , and in @entity74
but operate very differently but the players do extremely well , @entity286 says
and professional sport must be considered a successful form of modern capitalism
