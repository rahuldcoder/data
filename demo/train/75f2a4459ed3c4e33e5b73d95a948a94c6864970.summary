-- @entity2 's big wednesday event in @entity3 for the new @entity4 was streamed live online around the world -- filled with gameplay , tech talk and a display of new features			1
curious gamers watched , flocking to @entity11 and other social sites to share their thoughts			1
perhaps ironically , not everyone was a fan of the @entity16 's ability to share via social sites			1
lead system architect @entity18 outlined a menu of new social features built in to the @entity16 such as sharing gameplay with friends , being connected through existing social networks and monitoring what you play and what you purchase			1
" why does @entity2 think we want to tell everyone about what games we 're playing ? " @entity30 wrote on @entity11			0
" i want to sit in a dark room on my own with a pad			0
" in the gaming world , some said , sharing is n't always a plus			1
" i would much rather figure out how to beat the game myself rather than have someone complete it for me , " @entity37 tweeted			2
and in the social age , whenever there 's talk of sharing , inevitably the discussion turns to privacy concerns			1
" ' this system is very aware of the player and whatever is going on in the room at any given point , " tweeted @entity47 , a tech contributor for @entity49			0
" i do not want this , do you ? " but @entity57 , ceo of gaming - oriented social site @entity59 , told @entity0 he thinks the social sharing feature built in to the @entity16 is exactly what next - generation devices should be doing			1
" the ability to capture an image , video , or instantly broadcast what 's on your screen to your friends is transformational for the new generation of consoles , " @entity57 said			2
" providing players community tools to create content for your game in the form of videos and live broadcasts is not simply a cool feature for gamers but also great for business			1
user - generated content keeps players engaged with the game even while they are n't playing it and also attracts new users from the buzz generated around this content			1
" but features aside , a gaming system is only as good as its games			0
that theme started early in the day when gamers on @entity11 created the trending hashtag # @entity93			2
many used it to recall fondly playing classic titles such as " @entity98 " or " @entity99 " on the original @entity101 console			1
@entity2 showed off how powerful the @entity16 will be with in - game footage and demos from a handful of new titles , including updates to the " @entity107 " and " @entity109 " franchises			1
their visuals and gameplay demos induced a lot of digital drooling			1
" the pre-release video of ' @entity107 ' convinced me to get a @entity116			0
' @entity117 ' might 've just done the same for the # @entity16			2
outstanding ! " @entity118 wrote about the demo for " @entity107 : @entity117			0
" even brand new games , such as " @entity121 " from @entity122 , drew praise despite not showing any in - game footage			2
@entity125 liked what she saw when a dragon appeared on screen			0
" oh yes ! @entity121 is going to be my top purchase for @entity16 ! " she tweeted			2
" dragons and gorgeous graphics are win - win for me ! " but the snark @entity11 is famous for was evident during the rollout of " @entity109 : @entity135 , " a game set in a dystopian future where cameras monitor your every move			2
" ironically , this game is coming out on a system that will track & broadcast every damn thing you do or play or buy , " wrote @entity141 senior features editor @entity142			0
some folks did n't like that while tons of details were rolled out , the @entity4 console was n't displayed wednesday			1
" @entity155 , " tweeted one user in the site 's hashtag - as - punchline style			0
@entity156 went with a more established @entity158 catchphrase			0
" pic or it did n't happen , " he wrote			0
in the end , most who paid attention seemed impressed with what they saw			0
but not all were ready to hand @entity2 the console - wars victory			0
" @entity16 looking nice , but ca n't wait to see what # @entity167 has , " wrote one user			1
" the ball is in your court now			0
" many gaming insiders predict that @entity167 will show off its new console -- possibly the xbox 720 -- at the @entity174 in june			2
that would likely mean new consoles from the two rivals both will hit the market in time for the holidays .			0
