@entity0 -- @entity4 has accepted " in principle " an @entity6 plan to permit observers into the country to verify whether the regime has taken measures to protect civilians , a senior @entity3 diplomat said friday			1
questions remained , however , about the exact nature of the mission , if it proceeds			0
originally , 500 observers were believed to be destined for @entity4 , but @entity19 spokesman @entity18 said friday afternoon that the proposed number had been reduced to 40			1
@entity4 requested amendments to the plan thursday night , a day after @entity6 representatives approved it , the @entity0 - based regional alliance said on its website			1
@entity26 , secretary - general of the @entity6 , said the league is studying the letter from @entity4 foreign minister @entity29 that included changes regarding the protocol and duties of the observers			1
eighteen of the alliance 's 22 member nations voted to suspend @entity4 's membership in the league on saturday			1
but the group , which met again in @entity39 , @entity40 , on wednesday , gave @entity41 three days to implement a protocol to allow observers to enter the nation			1
" our mission will be to portray the truth about the nature of the injuries ( and ) numbers of casualties and assess the hospitals , to see what they need and how well - prepared they are to accommodate the injured , " said dr. @entity54 , a former member of the @entity55 and founding member of the @entity57 who said he 'd volunteered to be an observer			1
it is the latest diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis in @entity4			1
international pressure has been mounting on president @entity63 over his regime 's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters , amid concerns that violence in @entity4 is escalating			1
world support and confidence in the @entity4 regime have continued to dwindle in recent weeks			2
@entity73 's top diplomat called the state of affairs in embattled @entity4 " no longer tenable " friday and wants the @entity75 to step up and grapple with the eight - month - long crisis in the turbulent @entity3 nation			1
" despite all the calls that were made to that regime " for peaceful initiatives to end the raging street violence , @entity73 foreign minister @entity78 said in the @entity80 capital of @entity81 , " the regime did not want to know anything			1
still this morning , in the north of @entity4 , several villages were bombarded by the @entity4 army			2
" @entity93 foreign secretary @entity92 will meet monday with representatives from the @entity95 and @entity96 , two groups opposed to president @entity63 's government , a foreign office spokeswoman said friday			1
the @entity98 , another activist group , said that at least 19 people were killed friday by security forces and the army , among them four children			1
this is in addition to 26 killed by security forces thursday , on top of scores killed earlier in the week , according to the organization			1
eight people were killed in the southern region of @entity109 , where about 20 people also were wounded when security forces fired at mourners			0
there were five deaths in @entity114 , in the west , four in the @entity41 suburbs and two in @entity118 , also in the west , the @entity98 said			0
the state - run @entity120 , meanwhile , reported the killings of two law enforcement members in @entity114 , the injuries of two in @entity109 and the arrests of 10 " terrorists " in @entity129 province			0
@entity1 is not able to independently verify claims of fighting and casualties because the @entity4 government has restricted international media access to the country			2
well over 3,500 people have been killed and thousands have been jailed in cities across the country , according to @entity75 estimates			0
@entity73 and @entity80 officials have been outspoken in their criticism of the @entity4 regime 's behavior , and some key international diplomats , such as @entity146 foreign minister @entity145 , said thursday that the ongoing attacks on government buildings in @entity4 " look like a civil war			1
" news agencies have been quoting @entity78 as saying it is " too late " for @entity4 to make the reforms the regime has promised			2
at the same time , he urged opposition protesters to shun violence			0
in recent weeks , a military force of defectors called the @entity157 has launched strikes against government targets			0
this week , the force said it attacked an air intelligence base outside @entity41			0
also , army defectors armed with a rocket - propelled grenades attacked a pro-government youth group office and clashed with @entity4 security personnel , activists said			1
and on friday , a video emerged of another defector group announcing its formation : the @entity170 of @entity41			2
" we promise @entity63 and his unjust group that you will see us in every place and time and you will see from us what you do n't expect until we return the freedom and dignity to our people , " the group said in the video			0
@entity78 , meanwhile , urged the @entity4 opposition " to take the stance that they have taken from the beginning , which is the refusal of violence			2
" " but i think that the point has now come to renew our efforts to accelerate sanctions			0
we all support a resolution to that effect at the @entity192			0
@entity73 is happy to work with the @entity6 , with @entity80 , with all the countries in the region and to work with the opposition which shows a lot of courage , " @entity78 said			2
@entity78 said " it would be good " if the @entity75 asserted itself on the issue			0
" it is not normal in a crisis of this scope : 3,000 dead already , 20,000 prisoners in @entity4 prisons , which are sometimes treated very brutally with torture , " @entity78 said			2
" it is not acceptable that the @entity75 does not speak up			0
" @entity80 foreign minister @entity207 , appearing with @entity78 , said his nation opposes " all kinds of use of violence against civilians " and hopes " @entity3 peoples will determine their own fate in this vein without a need for foreign intervention			1
" he said that calling for @entity63 's ouster and the establishment of a no - fly zone are not up for discussion			0
" if massacres against civilians continue , we wo n't be indifferent to that whether it 's in @entity4 or any other country , " he said			2
@entity4 has blamed the violence on armed terrorist groups			2
but activists and citizens say the government 's military and security personnel are responsible for the many casualties there			0
@entity238 secretary of state @entity237 said in @entity239 , @entity240 , on friday that the @entity238 had been concerned for weeks that the situation in @entity4 was spiraling out of control			1
@entity4 's failure to make promised reforms had led to a peaceful opposition " morphing " into one that was , at least in part , well armed and prepared to take action against the @entity4 government , she said			2
now important regional players like the @entity6 nations and @entity80 " are sending ( the ) same message loudly and clearly : that the @entity4 government has to change , and it has to change now , or we all fear what the consequences will be , " she said			1
@entity80 , formerly an ally and major trading partner of @entity4 's , has toughened its stance this week , threatening to cut its electricity supply to @entity4 and asking why the international community has not taken the kind of action to protect civilians that it took in @entity266 through @entity267			0
@entity19 spokesman @entity18 in @entity268 said @entity80 had " become an increasingly vocal opponent to what 's going on in @entity4 and an increasingly powerful voice among the international community " in calling for an end to the violence			0
a draft @entity75 resolution is in the works , backed by @entity278 , @entity73 and @entity93 , who have sought support from @entity282 nations for the move			0
@entity78 noted @entity285 economic sanctions against @entity4 and said " we are ready to harden those sanctions			0
" @entity285 foreign policy chief @entity290 on thursday reiterated her call for @entity63 to step down , her spokeswoman said			1
@entity292 spoke after a meeting with @entity145 in @entity294			0
@entity296 's @entity295 has said that a person in @entity63 's position would step down , a statement observers interpreted as a call for the @entity4 president to do just that			1
according to @entity146 's @entity304 news agency , @entity292 said she is confident that @entity295 would " reiterate the position that it 's about time for president @entity63 to go			0
" an @entity285 official said @entity292 has asked @entity6 head @entity26 to attend a meeting of the @entity285 's foreign ministers and talk about ways to put pressure on the @entity63 regime			1
the official did n't want to be named because he is n't authorized to speak about the matter			0
@entity1 's @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity323 contributed to this report .			0
