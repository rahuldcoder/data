-- as the nation continues to grieve for the six adults and 20 children taken too soon in the @entity5 , @entity6 , school shooting , a hero from another generation has slipped peacefully into the pages of history			1
there were many who knew sen. @entity13 , a @entity14 and @entity16 recipient from @entity17 who passed away monday , better than we did			1
but we had the good fortune of sitting with him this past summer , interviewing him and hearing some of the remarkable stories from his life in @entity26 's service			2
the portrait that emerged was that of a man of courage , character , and , perhaps above all , a singular spirit of peace and good will that was forged , paradoxically , amid some of the most horrendous carnage of the @entity36			1
news : @entity17 's @entity13 , @entity38 's second longest - serving member , dead at 88 some of @entity13 's deeds -- his valor serving on the @entity42 front in one of @entity26 's most decorated ( and heavily wounded ) units , his herculean political efforts on behalf of his home state -- have been well remarked			1
what we were especially struck by was his quiet , sagelike humanity			2
there was his story , for example , of the day during the war when he came upon a @entity42 soldier who appeared to be preparing to kill him			2
the @entity42 , as @entity13 told it , put his hand into his shirt , and @entity13 , thinking he was reaching for his weapon , " smashed him in the face			1
" as the man hit the ground , his hand fell out of his shirt , revealing photographs -- the soldier 's wife , his kids			2
" so help me , up until that moment , i looked upon @entity42 as enemies , period , " said @entity13 , who had by then killed many enemy soldiers already			1
" from that moment , i looked upon him as a father , son , uncle , boyfriend			2
and it 's not easy to kill			2
" it was , he said , what he always told people when they expressed disbelief that he , a decorated veteran , could stand up against the war in @entity78			1
" you 've got to convince me before we go to war , " he maintained			2
" you would never forget running over a dog -- the bump			0
if you do n't forget that , how can you forget killing a human being ? " to hear @entity13 talk was to sit beside a still , fathomless pool -- he spoke with a measured calm and wisdom that made clear how deep the dignity beneath it ran			1
in that way , he called to mind an echo of former senate majority leader @entity93 -- of whom , @entity13 said , " if there was a mentor , it was him			1
" and he carried @entity99 's stoic ability to forge consensus and compromise with him , far into a legislative era known for its strident opposites			1
of his 12 subcommittees , @entity13 told us in july , " nine of them have reported out their bills almost unanimously			1
about six were unanimous -- 30 - 0			0
the others were 29 - 1 , 28 - 2			0
... that 's this month			0
it can be done ! ... and 30 - 0 includes ( senate minority leader mitch ) mcconnell ! " his secret was deceptively straightforward : a steady practice of simple gestures -- sitting with senators who had objections , calling a senior @entity118 " vice chairman " instead of " ranking member " ( " i hate that word ' ranking ' -- it 's something like ' stink ' ! " ) , not speaking ill of anyone to the press			0
" it might take some patience , but when i found out that you were pissed about ( a ) program , i 'd sit down with you and talk about it , " he told us			0
" little things like that make a difference			0
" it was a basic humanity and a largeness of vision that @entity13 extended to individuals from all backgrounds , born not only out of his experiences seeing his own people -- @entity140 - @entity26 -- vilified and interned during @entity36 ( @entity13 himself signed up as soon as the @entity26 government lifted its ban on @entity145 - born @entity140 enlistments ) , but from his own crucibles in the war			1
describing the injury that cost him his right arm and very nearly his life , @entity13 told us of being taken to the @entity152 hospital , of being initially counted a hopeless case , of having his arm amputated without anesthesia , of ultimately receiving 17 blood transfusions to stay alive			1
of those 17 transfusions , he explained : " that made a little difference in my outlook on life			0
in our last battle , the regiment was attached to the @entity164 -- all @entity145			0
hospitals were run by the @entity164 , and in those days , i do n't know about the other hospitals , but in the one i was in , ( the blood ) came in a glass bottle , with tape -- donated by so and so , private , @entity164			0
so you know he 's @entity145			0
well i got 17 pints			0
" if it were n't for ( the 92nd ) , i would n't be here			0
the war did a lot to change your ideas			2
i looked upon ( people of color ) , as i do today , as brothers			0
what else can i do ? after all , i 've got the same blood			0
" throughout its history , the nation has been blessed to have men like @entity13 -- reserved , unboastful men , whose actions show the deep reservoir of quiet honor from which they draw their strength			1
who show the courage that @entity193 called " grace under pressure			2
" when he was first brought to the @entity152 field hospital after sustaining the wounds that would claim his arm , @entity13 related , " the doctors looked at me ; they 're mumbling among themselves , " he recalled			1
" two minutes later a chaplain comes up -- opening words : ' @entity201 loves you			0
' " i said : ' i know that			0
i love him too , " he recounted with a chuckle			0
" ' but i 'm not ready to meet him yet ! ' " no one can know the ways of the @entity209 , but we would be surprised if he was n't happy to meet @entity13 today			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 and @entity214 .			1
