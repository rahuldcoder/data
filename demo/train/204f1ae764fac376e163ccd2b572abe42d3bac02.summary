@entity0 -- the laser surgery business is booming for treatments like hair , tattoo and wrinkle removal			1
@entity7 gets laser treatment from a doctor , eight years after she says she was scarred by earlier treatment			1
in 2005 , the last year recorded , the @entity11 for @entity12 said its members performed nearly 1 million such procedures , about 300,000 more than in 2003			1
board certified dermatologists , however , are not the only ones operating lasers on skin			0
laser treatments are offered at local beauty salons , and are also a big part of the medical spa industry , which has grown by 160 percent in the last three years , according to the @entity23			1
the association says a medical spa operates under the full - time , on - site supervision of a licensed health care professional			0
it offers traditional , complementary and alternative health practices and treatments in a spa - like setting			0
some doctors are concerned that while these high - tech devices can produce amazing results , in the wrong hands , the outcome can be horrifying			0
eight years ago , computer programmer @entity7 went to her neighborhood salon in @entity39 to have the rose tattoo on her back removed , a decision she said that left her not only with physical scars but emotional ones as well			1
@entity46 said a laser was used to peel back layers of the tattooed skin			1
she said she knew the procedure would hurt , but was not prepared for what she experienced -- pain that was excruciating " beyond words			0
" watch more on the dangers of illegal laser surgery " i was in tears for i believe a week , but certainly while she was doing it i did n't have any anesthesia or anything			1
she literally had a laser pen and was zapping across my skin , " she said			1
and she said the tattoo was only partially removed			2
the proliferation of medical spas and other clinics offering laser treatments worries the @entity69 , which said botched laser skin procedures increased 41 percent from 2005 to 2006			1
" we see a definite increase in the number of people being damaged by untrained individuals using these lasers and we think that this is just going to be more of a problem , " said @entity71 , president of @entity69			0
he and other doctors say the increased demand for laser surgery is outpacing the number of people properly trained to use it			1
" if you use them inappropriately , you can damage tissue severely			0
you 're trying to damage very selectively , but you can do more than that , so that you can draw a hole in someone if you are being dumb about things , " he said			0
" sadly , there are many people who are laser techs who have done very little , maybe a weekend course , maybe some other training			1
we believe that you require more information than that , " @entity71 said			0
he thinks a physician should always be present during the procedures and that those performing it should have at least basic knowledge of the response of body tissue to lasers , like a registered nurse or physician 's assistant			2
the @entity69 and organizations like the @entity114 of @entity112 , put the blame squarely on state regulatory boards for what they consider a lack of effective oversight in the industry			2
regulation on who can use lasers and what defines " medical supervision " differs from state to state			2
some states require a doctor on site , others do not			2
according to the @entity69 , @entity130 is the only state that requires a doctor to be present in the room while the procedure is taking place			1
only four other states require that a physician be on site and available for consultation during treatments			0
the rest require less stringent physician involvement -- like simply being available by phone or beeper , for example			0
" if we could get a clear definition from the state medical boards as to what medical supervision is , it would make our lives a lot easier and it would keep consumers much safer , " said @entity146 , executive director of the @entity147			2
the salon that @entity46 said disfigured her back eight years ago has gone out of business			2
since then , she has thought a lot about warning signs that should have stopped her from going there for laser surgery			1
for example , a woman at the salon gave her a price quote on the phone			1
" i mean , without knowing anything about my medical history , that right there should have immediately been a red flag			0
" now , @entity46 again is enduring painful laser treatments to reduce the scarring and hopefully get rid of the rest of the tattoo she also tailors her wardrobe to hide the scar			1
" @entity180 is probably my least favorite season because it 's the only time either it 's showing or i have to make special efforts to cover it up , " @entity46 said			0
" even for my wedding i had a strapless gown , but i had to have a really long veil to cover it up and it was something i was self - conscious about every evening			0
it affects every day of my life			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
