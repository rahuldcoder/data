@entity0 former @entity4 gov. @entity3 's surprise announcement that he 'll " actively explore " a presidential bid tuesday morning did little to dissuade his potential @entity7 opponents from the race			1
following the news , @entity10 sen. @entity9 , who might make a @entity12 bid , offered the clearest pitch yet for his own candidacy			0
" i think i have a unique ability to deal with the threats we face at home and abroad and the challenges here , which is finally getting the government to work and dealing with a dangerous world , " he told reporters on @entity17			0
he said to " stay tuned " for his plans			0
" i think there are a lot of people in the donor class who are looking for multiple voices , including @entity3 's , and competition is a good thing , " @entity9 said , adding , " he 's got a lot to offer the @entity7 and the country			1
" @entity37 sen. @entity36 was upbeat about the governor 's announcement			1
" i think we 're a big tent — we can use moderates , conservatives , libertarians — we need ' em all , " he told reporters			0
" i think the more the merrier — the public will determine " whether @entity3 could win			1
and @entity4 sen. @entity49 's spokesman , @entity48 , said while @entity49 has " a lot of respect " for @entity3 and thinks he 'd make " a formidable candidate , " @entity3 's decision has no bearing on his own			1
" @entity49 's decision on whether to run for president or re-election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda to restore the @entity60 — not on who else might be running , " @entity48 said			1
many observers believe if @entity3 jumps in the race , @entity49 — who 's been mentored by the former @entity4 governor since his entry into politics — would n't run			1
but a source close to @entity49 said tuesday that while tuesday 's announcement changes the dynamic of the race , the junior @entity4 senator is still " on track to run for president " in 2016			1
another potential opponent , @entity74 sen. @entity73 , barely acknowledged that the two could face off in the primary fight			1
" i think what @entity7 want is someone who will stand up and lead , who will take on the great challenges of the day , who will make the case that the path we 're on is n't working ; that the @entity87 - economy is a disaster , that @entity89 is a trainwreck , that our constitutional rights are under assault and that we need to restore @entity94 's leadership in the world , " he said			0
sen. @entity96 of @entity97 , who recently left the door open to his own 2016 bid , said the @entity3 announcement was " kind of expected			2
" now , though , " everyone is starting to feel pressure to start making moves , " he said			0
but even though @entity3 is seen as one of the top establishment picks in the primary if he runs , it was clear tuesday morning he 'll still have some work to convince some party leaders			2
@entity111 sen. @entity110 , the @entity7 's 2008 presidential nominee , would n't disclose what he discussed in his recent meeting with @entity3 , only that they went over the " ins and outs " of a presidential campaign			1
he would n't back the governor , either , since he 's still waiting to see whether @entity9 , who @entity110 called his " closest friend , " decides to run			0
@entity3 would enter the race with his " contributors , his family name , a long record as very successful governor , " @entity110 said			2
sen. @entity125 , considered a possible vice presidential pick , told reporters he has talked to @entity3 recently about a potential campaign			2
" he 'll be a strong candidate , " said @entity125 , who recently announced he would be running for re-election rather than the @entity12 in 2016			0
none of the @entity7 senators noted one of @entity3 's biggest liabilities in a @entity7 presidential primary , however — his support for policies anathema to conservative @entity7			1
@entity3 's support for @entity139 educational standards and his previous openness to a pathway to citizenship have drawn him many critics on the far - right , and he 'll face a challenge in winning over some of those primary voters			1
soon after his announcement , the @entity146 , an outside spending group , emailed its supporters asking them to sign a petition urging @entity3 not to run and decrying him as " another establishment , compromising " @entity7			2
but even right - wing firebrand @entity73 on tuesday held his fire when given the opportunity to attack @entity3 on one of his primary vulnerabilities , immigration reform			1
" immigration will be a critical issue in this next election because we have a president who has been unwilling to work with @entity164 on common sense immigration reform , " @entity73 said , when asked how @entity3 's position on immigration would play out in the primaries			1
and some republicans on @entity17 argued @entity3 still had a lot of work to do simply building the operation and support he 'd need to compete in a primary			0
@entity174 sen. @entity173 , also seen as a possible vice presidential pick , noted @entity3 has yet to stop by her state — which hosts the first primary in the nation — to meet with grassroots activists			2
" i do n't care who you are , you have to do the hard work in @entity174 , " she said			0
" you got ta do the grassroots			0
you got ta get down there and talk to the activists			0
" she acknowledged that he 'd have " the @entity3 name recognition , " but said there 's no substitute for hard retail politicking in the @entity174			2
" it will make a difference how hard the candidates work in terms of meeting the activists and answering the hard questions , " @entity173 said			0
@entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report			0

sen. @entity36 *welcomed* @entity3 into the race : " the more the merrier ! "
a spokesman for sen. @entity49 said @entity3 's decision would have no impact on his own
