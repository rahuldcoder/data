@entity0 -- like pretty much every gay @entity3 with an internet connection , i 'd gotten sick of staring at @entity5 and @entity6 all month , waiting for the day the @entity7 would rule on same - sex marriage			1
i got essays to write , men to marry , havoc to @entity11 , " one @entity13 user , @ theferocity , wrote monday			0
so on wednesday morning , with the court sure to issue opinions on cases involving proposition 8 , @entity17 's same - sex marriage ban , and the @entity18 , or @entity18 , the federal law prohibiting married same - sex couples from collecting federal marriage benefits , i decided to find real - life people -- off the @entity27 -- to share the potentially historic moment			1
after making a few calls , i arranged to meet a group of five homeless @entity32 young people at a coffee shop in @entity0 's gayborhood			1
i was hoping the court would send them a positive , affirming message -- that they matter , that they exist , and that they 're fully equal under the law			1
and i wondered what they thought about the national debate			0
the news that the court struck down @entity18 and balked on @entity42 led teary - eyed crowds to cheer , hug and hold rainbow - colored flags in other parts of the country			1
but the news rang hollow here			1
opinion : for gays , profess stunning , fast " it does n't really matter			0
it does n't affect anything , " @entity51 , 23 , said of the court 's decisions			1
@entity51 left home at 12 , he said , because his parents did n't accept the fact that he 's gay			1
" regardless , people are still going to hate us			2
" " when same - sex marriage becomes legal , and we 're able to get married , there 's going to be a lot more people ( coming ) out of the closet , which means there 's going to be a lot more hate crimes			1
that 's how i look at it , " said @entity69 , 20			2
@entity72 , the 50 - year - old who manages the six - bedroom @entity0 shelter named lost - n - @entity74 , read updates from @entity6 ( it 's short for @entity7 , for the uninitiated ) from his @entity77			1
" @entity18 is unconstitutional ... , " he told the group			2
hooray , right ? @entity79 , 24 , initially was the only person who clapped			2
" come on , clap ! " she implored			0
instead , they left to go on a smoke break			0
maybe such indifference comes off as smug or ungrateful at a time when many lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people -- and our supporters -- are celebrating			1
but it should n't -- not if you take a hard look at what it 's like to be an openly @entity32 young person in many parts of the country			1
according to one survey , 40 % of homeless kids are @entity32			1
they live in societies and in families that discriminate against them			0
opinion : how youth led change in public attitudes that 's true whether or not @entity18 exists			2
most states do n't sanction same - sex marriage ( can we start calling it simply " marriage , " by the way ? )			1
most allow people to be fired for being gay -- legally			1
this is a fight that 's far from over			1
" today 's @entity18 ruling is a historic step forward for # @entity120			2
# @entity122 , " the @ @entity13 feed posted			0
it is a huge step forward			0
and that should be recognized and lauded			0
i 'm thrilled for same - sex couples in @entity17 who likely will be able to marry in coming weeks because of the court 's opinion			1
but i feel for the couples in many other states who still ca n't -- and for kids like those who live at lost - n - found in @entity0 , who have grown up being taught they are less than human			2
watch all the " glee " you want			0
that 's still the reality			2
@entity69 , a young woman with a bright smile and a red - sequined shirt , told me her parents kicked her out of her home at 15 because she 's a lesbian			1
" it was n't good , " she said			0
" they 're really , really , really religious			0
" that was in @entity146			0
she lived with friends or slept behind dumpsters before moving to @entity150 to try living with her grandmother , who also rejected her			0
she landed at the homeless shelter in @entity0 a year and a half ago			1
when people have treated her so poorly -- simply because of who she is -- how could you blame her for being less than enthusiastic about the state of gay @entity3 ? @entity158 , a transgender woman , the one who clapped when @entity18 fell , took a sunnier point of view			1
" it 's not going to end the fight , " she said			1
" they expect people to lie down and take this and give up ? uh - uh , honey ! you 've got another thing coming ! " what 's next for gay rights movement ? i could tell @entity72 , the shelter leader , was thrilled to hear this			1
which was how i felt , too			0
@entity72 has been with his partner for 19 years			0
@entity18 and @entity42 matter to him very personally			0
and when he was the age of these young people , he said he never could have imagined a national conversation about same - sex marriage -- much less it being legal for some			1
" it 's one step in the right direction , " he said			2
" but when ? that 's my question			2
and it 's one that does matter			2
legalizing marriage across the country not only would have immediate benefits for same - sex couples and their children -- but it also would help change the society these young people inhabit			1
slowly , it would make the world safer for them			0
their speaking up will help , too , of course			0
as the conversation wound down , @entity158 proudly announced her latest @entity202 status update			0
" illegalizing love should be illegal , " she said , reading from her phone			0
she quoted @entity206 and then wrote , " haters need to get over their cheap selves now			0
" " ten exclamation points ! " she said			0
let 's hope plenty of state legislators follow her on @entity202			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity216 .			0

the @entity3 @entity7 rules on two same - sex marriage cases
@entity220 : fight for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality is far from over
he waits for news on court 's rulings with a group of homeless @entity32 people
a 24 - year - old : " they expect people to lie down and take this and give up ? "
