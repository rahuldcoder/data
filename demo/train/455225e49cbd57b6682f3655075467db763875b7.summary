-- this is an obituary , but not as you know it			0
one , the subject of this obituary is a horse			0
and two , he is n't dead			0
but come saturday , countless millions of racing fans the world over will be in mourning for one of the greatest racehorses the sport has ever seen			0
once a racehorse like @entity14 retires to spend the rest of his life in the breeding shed he is , in some sense , lost to us forever , and we are left wondering if we 'll ever see his like again			2
unbeaten at two , three and four years old , @entity14 's career yet seems too short for a talent that burned so bright			1
it is inconceivable that we would allow our human idols to retire , unopposed , at their peak of their brilliance			0
but the nature of thoroughbred racing is such that the best horses are victims of their own success : @entity14 is simply too valuable to race on			1
valued -- conservatively , some say -- at $ 160 million , @entity14 's true worth can only be realized away from the racetrack			2
infographic : what makes @entity14 so special ? undefeated in all 13 of his races , @entity14 is now preparing for this 14th and final challenge			1
for those who 've savored every one of his 13 appearances so far it will be chance to say farewell to the horse who has redefined our understanding of what is possible in an equine athlete			0
for those who have yet to see @entity14 in action , saturday provides one last opportunity to witness a piece of racing history as the @entity57 - trained colt lines up in the showpiece @entity58 at @entity60			1
but @entity14 's last race will also be his toughest yet , pitting him against the second best horse in the world on rating , @entity65 , winner of this race last year and looking in imperious form after a stunning victory in his native @entity70 over the @entity71 weekend			1
the venue for the showdown between the world 's two top - rated thoroughbreds , @entity60 , is one of the most venerable courses in racing -- but is not without its own idiosyncrasies			1
founded in 1711 by @entity80 , @entity60 retains close links with the @entity83 royal family			2
perhaps the best - recognized race meeting in the global racing calendar is @entity60 , which takes place in june each year			1
@entity87 -- one of the country 's best - known racing fans -- attends every day , arriving by horse - drawn carriage from @entity91			1
@entity14 immortalized on canvas she will be in attendance again on saturday to witness the @entity95 take his final bow			1
@entity60 has already witnessed what was arguably the greatest win of @entity14 's career -- maybe even the greatest win of any racehorse 's career -- his 11 - length victory in this year 's @entity104 at this year 's @entity60			1
that performance , reminiscent of @entity107 's 31 - length victory in the 1973 @entity108 -- cemented @entity14 's reputation as undoubtedly the greatest racehorse of the 21st century			1
but it was also the venue where the wonder horse came the closest he 's ever come to losing his unbeaten record			0
one year earlier , @entity14 had started in the 2011 @entity115			1
the pacemaker rerouted set a break - neck pace , soon opening up an enormous gap to the rest of the field			0
@entity14 's jockey , @entity121 , appeared to panic , and sent his colt off after the leader			2
@entity14 duly caught him , but the exertion nearly took its toll , and with a furlong to go @entity14 's stride was shortening			2
he just held off 20 - 1 shot @entity128 to win by three quarters of a length -- the smallest winning margin of his career apart from his maiden win over @entity135 ( a multiple group 1 winner in his own right who , incidentally , will also be lining up against his old foe on saturday )			0
notoriously undulating , the going for saturday 's race will be another test for the four - year - old , who has yet to prove himself over such soft ground			1
spot the @entity146 ! it plays neatly into the hands of his rival @entity65 who , by contrast , won over soft ground in his last impressive outing in @entity155			0
while most racing insiders will doubtless hold the view that @entity14 's sheer class will prevail , a cautionary note is sounded by the experience of @entity161 ; virtually identical conditions nearly caused a major upset earlier this season when the @entity166 sprinting sensation put her undefeated record on the line at @entity60			1
she hung on by the narrowest of margins and was rewarded with a pat on the nose from the @entity80 herself			0
@entity14 fans will no doubt be hoping the @entity80 's royal endorsement will bring him a similar degree of luck on saturday			2
in a vintage year for racing that has included not only the daring of @entity161 , the thrilling possibility of the first @entity184 winner in four decades in @entity185 , the bravado of the little @entity188 filly @entity189 to capture the @entity190 and @entity191 , @entity14 's final curtain call has been designed to be the climax to one of sport 's great narratives			1
@entity14 's entire career has been played out , poignantly , against the backdrop of his trainer 's battle with cancer			2
@entity14 himself was named after legendary @entity202 trainer @entity14 , who lost his own battle with cancer in 2009 , the year his namesake was born			1
@entity57 , who has been knighted by the @entity80 , was unable to attend @entity14 's brilliant win in the @entity207 at @entity208 earlier season as he was receiving ongoing treatment for stomach cancer			0
but he was determined to be at @entity211 for @entity14 's debut over the mile - and - a - quarter distance that he will attempt again on saturday			2
as a stunned crowed watched @entity14 demolish a quality field on his first outing over the longer trip , @entity57 permitted himself a smile			0
asked how his colt 's victory had made him feel , barely audible , he replied : " @entity220 again			0
" assuming @entity14 can deliver again on saturday he will give us the @entity222 ending this story so richly deserves			0
long after the applause has died down around @entity60 and the last champagne has been popped , @entity57 will begin the work of easing @entity14 down in preparation for his new life away from the track			1
but this once - in - a - lifetime horse will not be forgotten by anyone who has seen him in full flight , making his blazing runs down the home straight			0
we are destined to think of @entity14 every time we see one of his offspring at a race course			2
in a little over a year from now , the first of @entity14 's foals will be taking his or her first long - limbed steps in a paddock in some corner of @entity244			1
a year after that , if everything goes to plan , that foal could be making its first appearance at a race track			2
perhaps it will resemble him , with his four white socks and the perfect star on his forehead			0
his colts and fillies will be their own individuals , of course -- a blend of characteristics passed on by their sire and their dam			0
but if they inherit just some of their sire 's speed , his aggression and his indomitable will to win , a little bit of @entity14 's magic will live on .			0

@entity14 makes final appearance on a race course at @entity274
the four - year - old colt will be retired to stud after @entity58
@entity14 is unbeaten in 13 races and has acquired legendary status
@entity87 will be at @entity60 to watch the proceedings
