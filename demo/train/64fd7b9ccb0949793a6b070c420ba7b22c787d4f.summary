it used to be as plain as a beer - foam mustache			0
@entity2 , @entity3 , has more breweries and brewpubs than any other place -- in the sixties now -- ergo , it 's the world 's greatest beer city			1
and none of those breweries makes swill			0
but the world is changing for the better -- and catching up to a movement pioneered by @entity14			0
craft beer is worldwide now and other cities nip at our @entity18 heels in the crucial best - beer - city - in - the - world race			1
@entity21 and @entity22 are contenders without a doubt			0
various @entity28 capitals -- @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 -- all have thriving beer scenes			0
@entity34 , where @entity35 is building a big beer hall and brewery			0
@entity38 , where craft breweries are sprouting even as traditional @entity41 pubs close weekly			2
@entity45 , of course , where golden lager was born			0
even @entity47 , @entity48 , which rather noisily voted itself @entity49 a few years back , is now in the running for real with an impressive roster of local breweries and big new production breweries built by @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
@entity57 ' em all , for the rising tide of craft beer floats all boats , and we @entity14 welcome the company			1
as long as all acknowledge that there 's just one best beer city in the world : @entity2 , aka @entity67			1
here are 23 reasons , a number you 'll recognize as a prime , of which there are an infinite number			0
almost like being the best beer city in the world			2
according to supermarket tracking services , @entity2 leads the @entity77 in percentage of craft beer sales with nearly 40 % of beer purchases being craft beer			1
@entity3 breweries brewed 53 % of all the draft beer served in the state			1
we keep finding new places to serve beer , such as growler - fill stations , which have opened in major grocery stores , as stand - alone establishments and in a @entity92 @entity2 mini-mart that anywhere else would sell fried chicken and half - racks of @entity96			1
speaking of growlers ( large , re-fillable bottles that allow you to take large amounts of freshly tapped beer to go ) , the @entity2 - designed , steampunk - styled @entity97 keeps beer cold and carbonated and people love the idea : @entity107 hoped to raise $ 75,000 in its @entity109 campaign and so far nearly 5,000 people have donated $ 665,000 -- with about three weeks to go			1
it 's hard to imagine the critical mass of more than 60 brewing establishments in a town			1
in close - in @entity2 , a dozen breweries and brewpubs populate just a few square blocks			1
toss in pubs such as the basement , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity123 , and you have a walking beer tour that could fill a couple of days			0
if you do n't want to walk , there are several beer - tour companies including @entity131 beer bus tours ( with @entity133 - language tours , as well ) and the u-pedal aerobics of @entity135 , which is a sort of 12 - person pedal - powered bar with stools and an awning , except you ca n't drink on the road			2
we have the biggest outdoor beer party on the continent , july 's @entity145 , which attracts more than 85,000 people a year -- many of whom are out - of - state or international beer tourists -- to its five - day run at @entity152			2
missed the @entity145 ? no problem			0
beer festivals happen year ' round in @entity2 , such as december 's @entity156 , when thousands of big - beer fans drink ca n't - find - ' em - anywhere - else winter beers in large , heated tents in @entity2 's @entity160			1
it 's a rare day in @entity67 without a beer event , thanks to great bottle shops such as @entity164 , @entity123 , by @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 and others that organize a couple hundred beer releases , meet - the - brewer events , tap takeovers and the like every year			2
there are also brewers dinners , beer tastings and @entity176 's monthly beer summits			0
nobody 's done an official festival count , but @entity2 hosts more than a hundred a year , including specialized events such as an organic beer festival , a fruit beer festival , @entity182 ( only peach beers and ciders on tap ) and @entity186 9			1
@entity2 is the site of the national 2015 @entity187			0
can thousands of brewers and industry types be wrong ? 10			0
@entity2 created the fresh - hop beer category , when brewers trek to local hop farms for just - picked hops and make special beers			1
@entity3 celebrates its hop bounty with several fresh - hop beer festivals every fall , and pubs such as the @entity198 hold hop - picking parties harvesting backyard hop plants			2
@entity2 has a dedicated gluten - free brewery , @entity202 , where no barley malt nor wheat shall ever tread			0
they brew a variety of @entity208 beers with roasted chestnuts and the like			0
nationally distributed omission is also brewed in @entity2 , with traditional ingredients and a special process to remove gluten			0
anything qualifies as an excuse to pour special beers : recently opened @entity217 celebrated the life of @entity219 one night and @entity220 , owned by longtime @entity3 brewer ( and avid astronomer ) @entity223 , opened its first - anniversary week with an eclipse - viewing party on an overcast thursday			1
( the clouds did open briefly			0
in 2010 @entity226 opened a one - barrel nanobrewery called @entity227 in his @entity92 @entity2 garage			0
in late 2011 he took the plunge and opened @entity230 in a commercial space with employees , a tasting room and a seven - barrel system brewing farmhouse ales			0
at the end of this year , he 's moving to a space three times as big and adding a 15 - barrel brewhouse			0
who says you have to brew an @entity242 to make it in this town ? 14			0
but it does n't hurt : @entity242 is the beer that made @entity2 an @entity242 town 20 years ago , and is still a great beer and the brewery 's flagship , though its 60 - bitterness units of hoppiness is a modest number these days			1
as part of marriage preparations , some @entity2 couples brew their wedding beers with pro brewer @entity258 at @entity260 & @entity261 16			2
homebrewing is big in @entity2 with a number of homebrewers clubs and a dozen or more homebrew supply shops in the area , including @entity77 's oldest homebrew shop , @entity269 , founded in 1918			1
plus , @entity271 's collaborator program brews homebrewers ' winning recipes on a commercial scale , giving @entity275 beers that 'd otherwise never make it to market and donating part of the profit to an @entity281 scholarship fund			2
@entity282 and his brew crew at @entity284 set a goal of brewing 100 different beers in 2013 and they made it , brewing everything from @entity289 to @entity290			0
two @entity2 breweries -- @entity292 and @entity242 -- celebrate 30th anniversaries this year			2
@entity271 celebrated with 30 @entity294 for 30 years -- reprising beers from its brewing history such as 1994 's @entity299 - @entity298 19			2
being a sports fan does n't mean settling for an industrial lager			0
there are no fewer than four places to get @entity2 - brewed beers at a @entity307 @entity306 home game ; @entity271 and @entity308 each make special beers for the @entity311 soccer team and @entity242 brews a special beer for the @entity314 minor league baseball team			1
@entity2 breweries and brewpubs continue to evolve into interesting new shapes , such as @entity318 , a nonprofit brewery that donates part of its revenue to selected causes			1
@entity322 is a fine new @entity325 restaurant / brewery where you can get smoked duck moo shu and house - brewed rice lager			0
nearly everybody barrel - ages and brews sour beers these days , thanks to @entity3 pioneers such as @entity334 of @entity335 and @entity336			2
@entity226 and @entity337 helped create @entity3 's pivotal brewpub law of 1985 and have since built a quirky empire of nearly 60 pubs , breweries and hotels , each different and artist - decorated			1
along the way , they 've saved dozens of historic buildings such as the @entity347 and @entity348 , and have contributed mightily to @entity3 's thriving beer culture			1
nearby is an expanding universe of other great @entity3 beer towns , including @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 and more			1
fortunately , there 's an infinite supply of prime numbers ... is @entity2 the world 's best beer city ? got another pick ? share your best bar stool perspective below .			1

@entity2 , @entity3 , has led a worldwide craft beer *revolution* , but other cities have closed the beer gap
even so , @entity2 's scene continues to grow , evolve and lead the field

local breweries make beers celebrating pretty much anything ... including @entity219
