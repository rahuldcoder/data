@entity0 , @entity1 -- a pathologist hired by the family of one of two women whose mysterious deaths in @entity11 drew worldwide attention says her " lungs were 100 percent congested , " @entity4 's fiancee and brother said			1
@entity4 died while vacationing with her fiance at a @entity11 resort			1
" he said her lung tissue was gone , " said her brother , @entity16			2
the pathologist has not determined what caused her lungs to fail , he said , and a final report on her may 2 death may still be weeks away			1
but members of @entity26 's family said they feel the pathologist 's findings , though preliminary , are enough to contradict public statements made by @entity11 investigators that @entity26 was the victim of food poisoning			1
" i am 99.9 percent sure she did not die of food poisoning , " said @entity33 , @entity26 's fiancee , who was with her when she died			1
" she suffocated to death			2
i am not a doctor , but i know when someone ca n't breathe			0
" @entity33 and @entity26 , both artists from @entity0 , were on a three - month vacation through @entity42 when they arrived on @entity11 's @entity43			1
they had gotten engaged while on the trip and were keeping friends and family up to date with their adventures			0
" having a blast , " @entity4 , 27 , wrote about the surroundings in a blog dedicated to the couple 's travels			0
" food , drink , sun and warm waters ... what else do ya need ? " the couple 's vacation ended tragically when @entity33 found his fiancee in their hotel room vomiting and unable to breathe			2
he rushed her to a hospital where she died			2
@entity26 was healthy and there was no obvious explanation for her sudden death , her brother said			2
just hours after @entity26 fell ill , @entity73 , a @entity74 tourist who was staying in a room next to @entity26 's at the @entity76 , came down with similar symptoms			0
according to @entity11 media reports , police there are focusing on food poisoning as the cause of the women 's deaths			1
on monday , the @entity85 quoted a police commander as saying blood samples from both women indicated possible food poisoning from seafood			1
still , the commander said , those results were only preliminary			0
" i do n't know when the official results will be released , " maj. gen. @entity93 told the newspaper			0
" the lab work [ is being ] expedited because the embassies of the two tourists want to know the cause of death as soon as possible			2
" @entity102 response to @entity93 's statement was harsh			0
" that she died of food poisoning is a ridiculous statement to make , " he said , adding it is unlikely they would have been " the only ones affected			1
" dr. @entity111 , medical director for the @entity112 , is also skeptical that food poisoning could have been responsible			1
in food poisoning cases , he said , " usually what kills you is the dehydration , not the toxin			1
" he added , " food poisoning is not something that typically kills someone this quickly			1
" ingestion of a variety of chemicals could have caused @entity4 and @entity73 's sudden deaths , @entity111 said , and could be consistent with the condition of @entity4 's lungs			2
but without further information , he said , it is impossible to say what killed the two women			0
@entity33 said he thinks something in the hotel where they were where staying made @entity134 sick			0
he remembers a " chemical smell " in the room and thinks he avoided becoming ill because he spent less time in the room			0
on saturday , the @entity139 newspaper reported that investigators visited the @entity76 , taking samples and removing filters from the air conditioning units in the rooms where both victims had stayed			0
@entity146 , the owner of the hotel , told the newspaper her property was not to blame			0
" there is no problem with my guesthouse , " she said .			0
