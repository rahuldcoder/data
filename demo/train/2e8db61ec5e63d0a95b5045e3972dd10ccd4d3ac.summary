@entity0 , @entity1 -- each march , college basketball 's regular season fades from memory as fans and players gear up for the @entity8 and all the hoopla that comes with it : the brackets			1
but this year was different			0
long before march arrived , this season was officially jimmered			0
@entity15 guard @entity14 spent his senior season torching opposing defenses and shooting 3 - pointers from unguardable distances			1
" in a day and age where there 's very little must - see tv , i think he 's must - see tv , " said @entity20 , host of an afternoon sports radio show in @entity0			0
heading into the postseason , @entity14 is n't just leading the nation in scoring ( 27.9 points per game ) and starting to pile up player of the year awards			1
in the world of college hoops , the unassuming kid with the funny name is also tops in @entity36 references and @entity38 videos			2
he does n't really look the part -- undersized ( listed at 6 feet 2 inches ) and a little slow , with a linebacker 's shoulders			0
yet he scores at will , inspires songs and is responsible for college basketball 's version of a catchphrase -- teams do n't just lose to @entity15 , they get @entity50			1
" he 's one of those guys you expect the ball to go in and when the ball does n't go in when he shoots it , you 're kind of like ' wow , he just actually missed a shot , ' " says @entity51 , the play - by - play announcer for @entity15 's chief rival , the @entity54			1
fresh off a road win over then - no. 6 @entity63 , the @entity64 looked like a sure - fire no. 1 or 2 seed in the @entity8 -- a huge boon for a program that has yet to reach a @entity69			0
then news broke that the team 's primary inside player , @entity71 , had been suspended indefinitely for violating the @entity75 - owned school 's strict honor code			0
critics called @entity15 too @entity77 before			2
now the @entity64 may have no choice but to feed him the ball early and often when the tournament begins next week			0
a social media ' phenomenon ' what separates @entity14 from recent college basketball stars -- say , @entity85 or @entity86 -- is n't so much what he 's achieved on the court , but rather how much attention he 's garnered off it			1
it 's arguable whether the state of @entity1 has ever produced a better college basketball player -- @entity1 's @entity94 and @entity95 and @entity15 's @entity96 are close -- but there 's no comparing the hype			1
" he 's a fabulous player , i 'm not trying to take anything away from him , but he 's a little bit of a social - networking phenomenon , " @entity20 said			0
consider @entity14 's place in the hierarchy of collegiate sports			1
he does n't play for one of college basketball 's blue bloods like @entity108 or @entity109			0
@entity15 plays in the relatively obscure @entity110 with an abysmal tv contract			2
@entity112 exploded on january 26 during a game on @entity114 , a network lost in the hinterlands of paid - tv programming			0
@entity14 scored 43 that night in @entity15 's first meeting against @entity63 , prompting defending @entity121 scoring champion @entity120 to famously tweet , " @entity14 is the best scorer in the world			1
" in the week that followed , he became a sports media darling			0
fans quickly learned that @entity14 's biography was just as compelling as his scoring ability			1
raised in @entity128 , @entity129 , by a @entity131 mother ( who nicknamed him @entity14 ; his given name is @entity134 ) and a converted @entity75 father			2
his brother @entity136 served as a mentor and is now an aspiring rapper , best known for his song " @entity141 " and the accompanying @entity14 highlight reel on @entity38			1
big brother took @entity14 to play pickup ball in @entity129 , arranged games at a nearby prison against inmates and made him sign a contract that he 'd do everything in his power to reach the @entity121			1
it 's a goal @entity14 will reach next season -- though scouts remain torn on his professional potential			1
in that last week of january , @entity14 quickly rose from regional fame to household name -- and it did n't hurt that his name was a bit on the quirky side			2
" if his name is @entity134 , i ca n't @entity36 search @entity134			0
but if somebody types in @entity14 , the only reason , they 're typing in @entity14 is because of ( @entity14 ) , " said @entity20			2
@entity38 is is loaded with @entity14 highlights , clip after clip of him raining 3s from seemingly ill - advised distances or twisting in the lane for how - did - he - do - that ? layups			1
" he makes the long - range ones , but he 's really creative , really clever			0
... sometimes he uses his feet , sometimes he pauses , does all sorts of little things here and there that throw his defender off just enough where he can create space for himself and get off a shot , " said @entity173 , who covers @entity15 for the @entity174 and calls @entity14 " the mentally strongest athlete i 've covered in 20 years			1
" music videos sing his praises , such as the multiple versions of a " @entity186 " song on @entity38			2
there is even a blond @entity15 student singing him an acoustic @entity191 ode that goes , " so baby come on over , be my point guard			1
" heckling via @entity194 but technology can have a downside , too			0
@entity63 fans organized a massive @entity194 onslaught on @entity14 's girlfriend , @entity15 cheerleader @entity199			1
students reportedly " poked " her 7,000 times on the site before the february 26 game in @entity63			0
@entity63 student @entity204 designed and sold " i poked @entity206 " t - shirts			0
" they honestly were just meant as good fun , and of course to try and get into @entity14 's head , " said @entity204 via e-mail			1
@entity14 had a bit of an off day , scoring a mere 25 , but the @entity64 won and @entity14 and @entity199 simply shrugged off the hijinks			1
to a degree , that 's part of college basketball and regionally part of playing for @entity15			1
some call the school the @entity108 because of vitriol the school attracts from opposition -- love or hate , no middle ground			0
somehow , @entity14 seems to buck that trend			2
he 's heckled , to be sure , sometimes to classless degrees , but even opposing fans say they ca n't help but at least respect what he does			0
" for the most part , you always have to respect a talented player , " said @entity204			0
" i 've never seen as many off - axis , fade - away 3s in a career , let alone a season			0
that 's why it gives him a bigger target on his back compared to his teammates			0
" the real test , however , comes closer to home in @entity0 , where @entity243 fans are bred to hate @entity15 and boo their players relentlessly			2
" he 's kind of that rare guy that even ( @entity54 ) ute fans seem to appreciate what he 's done , whereas ( normally ) most of them would just hate the guy simply because he puts on a @entity15 jersey , " @entity173 said			2
@entity253 , a 20 - year - old @entity54 junior , is n't about to start rooting for @entity14 , but recognizes his ability -- especially after @entity14 's monster 47 - point performance at @entity1 's @entity256 earlier this season			2
" it was hard to watch and i do n't compliment @entity15 sports that often , but @entity14 's a really good player and it 's interesting to watch a player that never misses and at the game against us , he never missed , " she said			1
" he shot from everywhere and made it			0

@entity15 guard @entity14 is leading the nation in scoring and @entity38 highlights
" he 's one of those guys you expect the ball to go in ( when he shoots ) , " announcer says
despite all the hoopla surrounding @entity14 , scouts remain torn on his pro potential
