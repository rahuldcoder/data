-- known as " @entity2 , " they won fame and fortune on courts across western @entity6 in a golden era of style and glamor			2
some 80 years later , a new quartet of dashing young men is seeking to make a similar mark for @entity13			1
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 were collectively unbeatable in the 1920s and early 1930s , dominating world tennis for almost a decade and establishing @entity13 as a major power in the sport			1
named after a film version of the classic @entity25 novel , they ended @entity27 supremacy in the prestigious @entity29 teams competition , winning it six years in a row , and claimed 43 grand slam singles and doubles titles between them			1
the famous @entity36 venue was built in @entity37 to host the following year 's @entity29 defense , after their famous victory in @entity41 in 1927 , and the @entity43 's men 's singles trophy was named after them			1
after their demise , @entity13 had to wait 59 long years for another @entity29 triumph , and it has been a decade since its last -- and ninth overall -- title			1
the last @entity13 to win a grand slam was @entity50 , in @entity37 in 1983			1
but a modern group of players , dubbed " @entity55 " by national sports newspaper @entity53 , are striving to carve their own place in history			1
@entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 were ranked in the world 's top 13 after this month 's @entity63 , raising hopes that they can do better than when similarly placed as fresh - faced youngsters in 2008			1
last year they took @entity13 to the final of the @entity29 , losing to @entity74 's @entity73 , and this weekend they will travel to @entity76 , the home nation of the world @entity68 's predecessor @entity67 , in a bid to again reach the title decider			1
victory in @entity76 would likely set up a rematch with the @entity73 , who host @entity81 in the other semifinal -- with the champions undoubtedly fired up by @entity74 's @entity63 triumph			2
" when you do n't have goals , when you do n't have dreams , you are already dead			2
and this is a dream to win against @entity76 , in @entity76 , " @entity59 told @entity0 's @entity88			1
in 2008 , he lost to @entity74 in the @entity91 final , and this year he was beaten by the @entity73 in the @entity93 semifinals before falling to @entity94 in the last eight in @entity96			1
the all - action 26 - year - old will spearhead @entity13 's challenge on clay in @entity100 , with world no. 7 @entity58 ruled out due to a knee injury following his second - round exit at @entity104			1
while he and his colleagues have all been ranked in the top 10 , they are painfully aware they must take the next step and win major titles before they can be talked of in the same way as their more illustrious compatriots			2
" we have to win the @entity29 first , " @entity58 said			1
" and then , we try to win a grand slam ... but i think we need two or three @entity116 and then maybe we can be like musketeers			2
" the original foursome came from very different backgrounds , with @entity14 the most famous after establishing a fashion label once his glittering playing career had finished as well as inventing the steel tennis racket			1
" @entity14 came from a very wealthy family , " veteran @entity27 sports journalist @entity124 told @entity0			1
" his father manufactured automobiles and he fell in love with tennis when he visited some relatives in @entity131			2
his father said what are you going to do with yourself ? @entity14 said : ' i want to be a tennis player			1
' his father said : ' okay , but only if you can be the best			2
' " @entity136 moved into politics during @entity138 , serving as general commissioner to sports in the @entity141 government during the @entity143 occupation before being arrested by the @entity144 in 1942			2
he lived to the age of 95 and founded the @entity147			2
" he was very gallant			2
he came from the @entity149 region and he was called ' the @entity150 , ' " @entity124 said			2
cochet , nicknamed " the @entity157 of @entity158 " due to his role before becoming a successful player , was a world no. 1 like @entity14 and won seven grand slam singles titles			1
@entity17 was a doubles specialist who won 12 major titles in that discipline and died in 1978 aged 83 -- two years after they were simultaneously inducted into the @entity163			1
of the new breed , most was expected of @entity61 -- a child prodigy who ranked as high as seventh in 2007 , but has been rebuilding his career since a three - month absence in 2009 after testing positive for cocaine			1
" @entity61 really had a rough time in that he was on the cover of magazines when he was nine , 10 years old , " @entity124 said of a player who won the @entity43 mixed doubles title as a teenager in 2004			1
" in @entity13 , they were so excited about him , but it did n't help him			1
with the other guys , if they got together , they can pull the best out of him , because he should be the best player			0
" @entity59 also tipped his colleague to continue his recent improvement			1
" @entity61 is really , really talented			1
i think he has improved a lot these past couple of months			0
he 's tougher in his head and i think he 's going to play well in the future , " he said			0
" for him it was really difficult because he was really good really early , and all the pressure was on him			0
it 's not easy when you are young			0
for me it was completely different and i think far more easy			0
" @entity124 calls @entity59 , whose father is @entity194 , " probably the most exciting in the team			1
" " he just goes all out , diving for the ball , everything			0
at @entity93 , losing the first two sets to @entity94 ... that never happened before			0
@entity94 never lost the final - set match			2
and @entity59 is appealing , he looks like @entity202 , he 's terrific			1
" @entity37 - born @entity58 is another larger than life character , with his tattoos and dark , good looks from his @entity207 heritage -- his mother is from @entity209 , his father @entity210			1
" oh he 's exciting , " @entity124 said			0
" when he 's gon na lose , he jumps in the stands , he 's gon na do push - ups -- dive for ball , which he certainly will			0
" and he 's got a comical outlook on things -- you know , he 's a real prize			0
but then again , he 's this guy who does n't quite make it			0
" @entity58 said a passion for tennis is their biggest bond			1
" we are all different -- really different because we come different parts of @entity13 , " he said			1
" @entity226 is the only thing we have in common			0
we have tennis and that 's it			2
for us it 's a passion , i think , and this is why we are friends			0
" all four players live in @entity236 , and @entity61 said their friendly rivalry is helping them to progress			2
" they are my friends , so it 's very good			0
we try to win the @entity29 this year , " the 25 - year - old said			1
" it 's really nice to have them on the tour with me			0
it 's a nice competition between us because when one is playing good , we try to do the same			0
" while @entity58 and @entity59 make headlines with their athletic , never - say - die displays , and @entity61 with his undoubted talent , @entity60 is the quiet achiever of the group			1
ranked as high as sixth in 2009 and a nine - time winner on the @entity251 , the slightly - built 26 - year - old relies more on guile and baseline tenacity			2
" he 's very smart			0
he can run for hours and hours , " @entity61 said			2
" it 's very hard to play with him on a baseline			0
" you do n't see him like @entity258			0
he 's not very muscular			0
but he 's very , very tough to beat			0
" despite being aware of the feats of the original foursome from an early age -- statues commemorate the players at @entity36 -- @entity58 said he and his colleagues are not consciously trying to emulate them			1
" right now , i do n't really think about ' to be a musketeer , ' about the history			0
when you finish your career maybe you can say , ' ah they were maybe the next musketeers			0
' right now , you know , i do n't think about it			0
" we manage to beat @entity67 and @entity94 sometimes , and @entity74 also			0
and it 's a good generation -- we are good players but still there are far better players than us on the tour , " he said			0
" and we just try to win one slam also , because the last one was @entity50 in 1983			0
it 's 30 years ago			0
so , everybody wants us to do something very good			0
that 's why they call us this ( musketeers )			0
but for sure we do n't deserve it			0
