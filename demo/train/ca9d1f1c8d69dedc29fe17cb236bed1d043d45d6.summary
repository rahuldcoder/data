-- september 30 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : officials think they 've uncovered a terror plot that was targeting @entity17			1
that story leads off this thursday edition of @entity0			2
from the @entity21 , i 'm @entity22			2
first up : @entity17 @entity23 @entity24 : well , that terror plot , one source says the information comes from a man who was arrested in @entity29			1
he offered up some details about a " @entity32 - style " attack in @entity17			2
when we say that , we 're talking about the terrorist attack that happened in @entity32 , @entity35 two years ago			2
that is when ten men launched an attack that lasted three days and left more than 160 people dead			2
this man who told officials about the plot is a @entity43 citizen			1
he was arrested in @entity29 back in july and is now in @entity45 custody			2
he went to @entity29 last year and joined a group that 's connected to the @entity48 terrorist group			1
@entity17 officials are looking into the information that they 're getting			1
but @entity43 and @entity45 officials say , so far , they have n't found any evidence of an imminent attack either in @entity17 or the @entity45			1
is this legit ? @entity54 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the first lady is a member of the @entity45 president 's @entity56			1
not true ! the first lady can play a big role in a presidential administration , but she is not a @entity56 member			2
school lunches @entity24 : first ladies do have a lot of influence , and they can use that to make an impact on laws and policies			2
for example , first lady @entity70 's big push is to fight childhood obesity			1
and one of her goals is for @entity75 to pass a new child nutrition law			2
we 're talking about the school lunch program			2
it has n't been updated in about 5 years			0
this new bill that the first lady is pushing for would offer money to poorer districts to help pay for free meals , and it would require healthier foods in school programs			1
but it does n't look like this thing 's gon na become law anytime soon			1
you see , the money for these new programs would come from the food stamp program , and some @entity94 think that should be off - limits			1
one congressman said , " we 're not going to tolerate robbing the poor to pay for every piece of legislation			0
" @entity102 ? @entity24 : we 've been talking this week about how healthy eating means making choices			0
you guys can make those decisions for yourselves or talk to your parents about making them			0
but kids who are younger than you , maybe your little brothers and little sisters , might not know about choosing healthy foods yet			0
they might just want whatever meal has a toy with it			0
and that 's why some @entity119 officials are considering a ban on including toys with some fast food meals			1
@entity123 of affiliate @entity124 serves up the details			0
( begin video ) @entity127 , @entity129 supervisor : these toys that are used too often as incentives to lure and entice children to the meals			1
@entity134 , @entity124 reporter : happy meals went on trial in @entity129			1
@entity137 , @entity129 mother : the toy that comes in that unhealthy @entity140 ? there comes a price			0
@entity143 : the county 's @entity145 and @entity144 heard from consumers and @entity149 's executives on a proposal to ban restaurants from selling meals with toys like these , unless the food meets certain nutritional standards			1
@entity157 : meals must contains fruits and vegetables and not exceed 600 calories , and must not have beverages that have excessive fat or sugar			1
@entity143 : health advocates say fast food restaurants use these promotional toys to lure low - income children into diets high in sugar , fat and salt			1
@entity172 , @entity129 resident : the youth in my community are getting diet - related diseases , like diabetes and hypertension , at younger and younger ages			0
@entity181 , @entity182 , vice president of nutrition : we can use the toy in our advertisement to promote and educate on nutrition			0
we advertise our all - white - meat nuggets , our apple dippers , our low - fat white milk			0
@entity143 : the @entity149 's corporation flew in executives from @entity194 to tout what they describe as healthier menu options and to oppose the measure			1
@entity198 : i 'm a parent			0
i have two small children			0
i decide what my children will eat and what toy or what the environment will be			0
and so , banning or putting legislation that undermines what parents choices are , we believe are wrong			0
@entity143 : @entity210 owns ten of @entity129 's 19 @entity149 's restaurants			1
he calls the legislation proof of the city 's misplaced priorities			1
@entity215 , @entity216 : with the limited resources that our city has today , we should be focused on the greater issues : a public safety program that works			1
( @entity222 ) @entity223 @entity224 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to the students and teachers at @entity228 in @entity229 , @entity230 ! @entity4 , @entity231 and @entity232 are all cities in what country ? is it : a ) @entity237 , b ) @entity5 , c ) @entity238 or @entity239 ) @entity240 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! you 'll find those cities in @entity5			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity246 @entity24 : @entity5 played host to this year 's soccer @entity249			1
those of us who watched it still hear the horns			0
but there 's another sport , one from @entity256 , that 's gaining popularity in parts of @entity5 , including the @entity4 area			1
and people are n't just focused on what 's happening on the field			1
it 's about the sport keeping young people away from stuff off that 's off the field , too			1
@entity268 explains what we mean			0
( begin video ) @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity4 : @entity274 on the outskirts of @entity4 , just off the glossy , double - lane highway leading into @entity5 's second city			1
like many of the other townships ringing @entity4 , the lucky few live in government - built housing			0
but the vast majority live in shacks			0
hundreds of thousands of families with no power , no heat and no running water			0
@entity289 , like the one behind me , are an incredibly difficult environment for young men			0
guns , drugs , crime and a host of other temptations are a daily reality here , but an @entity45 import is now offering them a surprising alternative : baseball			1
coach @entity302 introduced the game here four years ago after @entity5 did well in the world baseball classic			1
@entity305 , baseball coach : i was staying here in @entity274			1
i found out that it 's a lot of crime that is abusing the children of this place			1
@entity312 : while baseball has gained some popularity in @entity5 in more affluent areas with access to international sports channels , in the townships , it was all but unheard of			1
and coach @entity302 said he banked on that novelty to draw in the children			0
@entity305 : once we started , then they came in interest			0
everybody wants to see what is this baseball			1
and then they started coming in numbers ! @entity312 : but once the team , the @entity330 , was up and running , their success has surprised even the coaches			0
@entity334 , baseball coach : the very first season , we started with two teams : under - twelves and under - fourteen			1
and amazingly , the under - fourteens won their league and the under - twelves came in second			0
and so , you can imagine the impact that had in the community , where these kids came home with a big trophy and ran around the community celebrating and everything			0
@entity312 : in a neighborhood where there is often little worth celebrating , the teams ' success has had a huge impact on the children 's confidence and aspirations			1
@entity360 : this township , very lot of drugs , bad things happening now			0
but now , if you do sports , and then you can stop doing drugs , all that stuff , bad stuff			0
@entity312 : and it 's not just on the sports field that trophies are being won			1
to play baseball here , you also commit to academic tutoring			1
it 's already paying off for some of the older children			2
@entity378 : it 's the commitment to something bigger than yourself			2
it 's the hard work , the discipline , everything that comes from that			2
you transfer that to the rest of your life and you 've got a much better chance			0
and when somebody comes up to talk , they do n't say , " thank you for spreading baseball			2
" they do n't say anything like that			0
what they say is , " thank you for getting these kids off the street			0
" @entity312 : @entity268 , @entity0 , @entity4			0
( @entity222 ) @entity401 @entity24 : from @entity5 to @entity256 for an update on those 33 men trapped in a mine in @entity6			1
they 're not out , not yet			0
but there is some progress in the rescue efforts			0
one of the drills that 's making a hole big enough for these guys to get out hit the halfway point yesterday			2
officials are looking at early november for when they think the rescue operation will actually happen			2
before we go @entity24 : before we go , i 'm @entity22 , and you 're watching @entity0 student news ! now , you hear me say something like that just about every day to introduce the show			2
now , we want you to do it ! this is what we talked about yesterday			0
