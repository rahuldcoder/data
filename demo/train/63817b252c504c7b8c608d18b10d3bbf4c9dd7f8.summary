@entity0 , @entity1 -- oil companies @entity4 and @entity5 began evacuating nonessential personnel from their drilling platforms in the @entity8 on saturday as officials kept a wary eye on a tropical storm churning toward @entity8 that could wreak havoc on oil spill cleanup efforts			1
as much as 2.5 million gallons of oil could flow into the @entity8 for two weeks if @entity17 forces a work stoppage at the ruptured @entity5 well , the government 's disaster response manager said			1
adm. @entity19 said gale - force winds near the well head would prompt an evacuation of the thousands of workers and vessels involved in the oil recovery and cleanup effort			1
both @entity4 and @entity5 were taking precautions ahead of the storm			1
about 300 people were evacuated from @entity4 's production platforms and drilling rigs saturday , company spokesman @entity29 said , adding that evacuations will continue sunday			1
@entity5 began similar evacuations saturday from three of its rigs in the far south of the @entity8 , spokesman @entity34 said			1
he noted that the evacuations do not include anyone involved in the @entity39 response efforts			0
if @entity17 forces a stoppage in cleanup , however , @entity19 said it would take 14 days to put everything back in place			1
that means the containment cap would be off for that period , allowing oil to flow freely			2
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels -- about 1.5 million gallons -- and 60,000 barrels -- about 2.5 million gallons -- of oil are gushing into the ocean every day			2
anxiety levels rose saturday as @entity17 churned toward @entity8 with a potential for hurricane - force winds in the coming days			1
the latest computer models show the predicted path of the storm passing well south of the @entity59 , making landfall in @entity8 as a hurricane in the middle of the week , according to the @entity63			1
if it continues on its predicted track , the storm would not directly pass over oil - affected areas -- but forecasters have not ruled out an easterly shift in @entity17 's path			1
" we all know the weather is unpredictable , and we could have a sudden last - minute change , " @entity19 said			0
@entity17 -- the first named storm of what is expected to be a fierce @entity76 hurricane season -- formed in the @entity77 on saturday and had maximum sustained winds near 65 mph			2
it was heading toward @entity80 and @entity8 's @entity81			1
@entity19 said it would take five days to evacuate more than 38,000 people and 6,000 vessels that are involved in the oil response as well as the two rigs that are collecting about 24,500 barrels of oil a day from the well , @entity19 said			2
he told @entity2 there is " no playbook " when it comes to responding to a massive oil spill as a storm brews			2
" but i will tell you there 's been an extraordinary amount of planning being done , " he said			2
@entity5 plans to place a third rig called the @entity99 at the well site next week , which will increase the amount of oil being captured to 53,000 barrels a day , @entity19 said			1
that , too , could be disrupted if @entity17 affects the area			2
@entity106 residents feared that high winds and storm surges could spread the slick and push more oil ashore into bays , estuaries and pristine beaches , exacerbating the oil disaster triggered by @entity5 's ruptured well			1
" the greatest nightmare with this storm approaching is that it takes this oil on the surface of the @entity8 and blows it over the barrier islands into the bays and the estuaries , " sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , told @entity2			1
" and that is where you really get the enormous destruction , because it 's just very difficult to clean up those pristine bays			0
" also saturday , @entity59 took to beaches from coast to coast to protest offshore oil drilling			0
they held hands and formed lines in the sand			0
" i believe @entity59 need to stand together and take our energy future back from the grip of the oil industry , " said @entity134 , a restaurant owner from @entity135 , @entity116 , who founded @entity137			0
deepwater drilling could resume by the end of july after @entity59 district judge @entity144 in @entity0 , @entity1 , on thursday denied a request to keep a six - month moratorium imposed by president @entity147 on may 27 in place , pending a government appeal			0
the government has 30 days to show it is beginning to comply with @entity144 's order and start issuing permits			0
the appeals process can continue , but until the appeal , the government must act as if @entity144 's order will be upheld			0
while protesters lined the sand , @entity17 moved toward @entity8 , no one knowing whether it would make a sudden turn north into the open @entity8			1
@entity2 meteorologist @entity160 said the " preferred scenario " actually would be for @entity17 to head to northern @entity116			2
that 's because the oil spill has been gradually rotating counterclockwise			2
if the storm heads to the east of it , it would send the oil farther out to sea			0
if the storm heads more directly towards the central @entity8 and @entity1 , it might push the oil toward @entity116			1
" we 've never been in this situation before , " @entity160 said			0
" we 've never seen an oil spill that encompassed the @entity8 like this , end up so close to shore			1
" a powerful storm would also complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline			0
" it 's going to mean we 're going to have to find a way to maneuver all our resources , change things , " said @entity181 , chairman of the @entity182 in @entity183 , @entity116			0
" we wo n't be able to fight the oil for a couple of days			0
and we have no idea about winds and current and what it will do to the oil in the gulf			0
so obviously , it 's a very big concern for us			0
" @entity19 said he and some top @entity147 administration officials , including vice president @entity197 , will be headed back to the @entity198 next week to assess the oil relief efforts			0
@entity2 's @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
