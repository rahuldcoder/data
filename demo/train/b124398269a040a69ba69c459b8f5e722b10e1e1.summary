@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 's public school system was told tuesday it has until september 30 to make progress on a series of recommendations or risk its high schools ' losing their accreditation , a fate that would affect the college hopes of many of the system 's graduates			1
the probation placed on the system 's high schools stems from complaints that conflicts between members had severely hampered the school board 's ability to govern effectively , according to a statement from @entity24 , the world 's largest school accrediting agency and the parent company of the @entity27			1
" this is designed to improve the school system , " @entity28 , president and ceo of @entity24 , said at a news conference tuesday			1
" the ( school ) board and the system have a choice here : they can choose to proactively take actions designed to improve it , building on these actions we have outlined , or they can fight it			2
" members of @entity46 met in a special session tuesday afternoon to review the report , and will vote next week to formally accept it , the @entity44 reported			2
@entity28 will be at next week 's meeting to answer board members ' questions , the newspaper said			0
the action is a " grave moment in our history , but one that we must resolve , " board member @entity55 told @entity2 affiliate @entity56			0
@entity24 conducted a special review looking into -- among other things -- a leadership shakeup initiated by the school board last summer			1
the board changed its policy to allow a simple majority vote to change the chair and vice chair positions , despite outside legal advice that such a policy change would be illegal			0
ultimately , a lawsuit was filed challenging the move			0
@entity2 education contributor @entity75 asks how @entity0 schools ' cheating scandal could affect students			2
the special review also found that the board circumvented its own procurement policies in approving a contract for a communications vendor , and that the " fallout " from the friction on the board had become a distraction to staff			0
according to @entity24 , the steps the school system must take to show progress include : developing a plan to effectively communicate is mission to staff and other " stakeholders ; " hiring a trained mediator to work with board members to resolve issues ; ensuring that board policies -- " especially those related to ethics and chain of command " -- are understood and followed ; and coming up with a plan for selecting a superintendent that " demonstrates integrity throughout the process			1
" @entity46 , which has 47,000 students , is the second large school system to have schools placed on probation , and the second in the metro area , according to @entity115 , vice president for communications for the @entity27			2
schools in @entity117 , south of @entity0 , lost their accreditation in 2008 and are approaching the end of a two - year probation			2
in an e-mail response to a question from @entity2 , @entity121 cautioned that @entity0 's public high schools " are still accredited , and it 's too early to speculate on about whether ( the schools ) will lose their accreditation			1
" however , she said , a loss of accreditation could mean that " graduating seniors may be limited in scholarships and college admissions if a program requires students to come from an accredited institution and / or uses accreditation of the high school as part of the criteria for evaluating students			0
" the school system , which had won national awards for closing academic gaps in recent years , was rocked last year by allegations of cheating on standardized tests given to elementary and middle school students			0
an independent commission found that employees at 12 schools had violated testing protocols , the @entity44 reported in june 2010			0
because @entity24 only accredits @entity0 's public high schools , it is n't involved in the test - cheating investigation			1
" however , " @entity121 said , " how the board addresses the results of the investigation as leaders of the school system will be of interest to ( @entity24 ) in regards to the @entity160 , which they are currently not meeting			1
" @entity2 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
