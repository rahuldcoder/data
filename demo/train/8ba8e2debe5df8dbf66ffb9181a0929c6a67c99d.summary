-- " it is so ordered			0
" four words , used by the @entity2 , that set loose a cascade of public policy			2
few phrases are as powerful and precise			0
on june 25 , when justice @entity8 closed the court 's majority opinion regarding @entity12 's anti-immigrant law , @entity13 , with these words , the court lifted a burden off the shoulders of local law enforcement as well as millions of immigrants across the country			1
last tuesday , the ripples reached @entity21 : the state 's @entity23 attorney general , @entity22 , said portions of his state 's @entity26 could not be defended			1
" the @entity2 made clear that immigration enforcement is a federal government responsibility , " @entity22 acknowledged			1
elements of @entity21 's law resemble those the @entity2 struck down in @entity12 's , including provisions giving local police unprecedented power to make warrantless arrests based on assumed immigration status			1
@entity22 saw the constitutional writing on the wall and freed his enforcement resources from an expensive court battle the state of @entity21 was sure to lose			2
the court 's ruling on @entity13 made it clear that state laws authorizing local law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of people for immigration violations are unconstitutional			1
opinion : do n't deport the ' tamale lady ' the court struck down three parts of the law , including the murky section that authorized state officers to arrest people based on " probable cause " that they had committed an offense that could lead to deportation			2
the court allowed a fourth section , the troubling " papers please " provision , to go into effect , but it left the door wide open for further legal scrutiny			0
lest you think otherwise , @entity22 is no shrinking violet when it comes to immigration enforcement and keeping our nation safe			0
he is an active member of the @entity75 of the @entity76 , in which attorneys general across the @entity79 partner with their colleagues in @entity81 to strengthen the legal systems of both countries and reduce crime			0
as @entity22 wrote in 2011 , " greater cooperation , trust and information sharing between law enforcers and judicial officers on both sides of the border creates a more peaceful backdrop against which the @entity79 government can work to improve an immigration system that clearly needs fixing			2
" working collaboratively across state lines and international borders to fight human and drug trafficking , money laundering and consumer fraud is a far better use of law enforcement resources than arresting landscapers and nannies			2
@entity22 is not alone in thinking there is a better way to enforce immigration law			1
last year , he joined a bipartisan group of business , law enforcement and religious leaders in signing the @entity113 , a set of principles to guide the state 's immigration debate			1
the compact affirms that immigration enforcement should be handled at the federal level , not the state level			2
the signers of the @entity113 joined like - minded leaders in @entity124 and @entity125 â € ” neither of which is a liberal stronghold â € ” who signed compacts of their own calling upon the administration and @entity133 to work together to create a common - sense immigration process			1
but @entity133 has failed to muster the will to craft legislation , and president @entity137 is reduced to making administrative changes to an antiquated system			0
sadly , the @entity2 's ruling on @entity13 is all we have to work with when it comes to federal guidance on immigration			1
opinion : why ' illegal immigrant ' is a slur but the winds of the immigration debate are changing			0
from the @entity152 to the @entity153 to the @entity154 , people who wear badges , run businesses and carry bibles are building a new consensus on immigrants and @entity79			0
the consensus is that immigration policy is a human issue			0
documented or undocumented , people have freedom that we protect			0
that is one of the ideals on which our nation is built			0
leaders such as @entity22 are doing what they are constitutionally required to do : enforce the law			0
@entity22 must and will protect the residents of @entity21 , regardless of their federal immigration status			2
to do so , he will direct all his resources toward tracking down those who would perpetrate crime on these residents and bring them to justice rather than dedicate scarce resources toward enforcing federal immigration law			1
the @entity2 has ordered that the federal government pre-empts states when it comes to immigration law			1
it is time the other branches of our federal government heeded that order and created a rational immigration process that allows law enforcement officials to do their job : keep us safe			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity21 's attorney general has declared most of the state 's new immigration law *indefensible*
he cited the june @entity2 ruling on @entity12 in his *announcement* , says @entity194
@entity21 is not alone in thinking there is a better way to enforce immigration law , @entity194 says
@entity194 : it 's time for the federal government to create a rational immigration process
