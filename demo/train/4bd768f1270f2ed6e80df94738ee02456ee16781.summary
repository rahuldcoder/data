-- let 's face it -- we 've all got issues and sometimes need multiple attempts to surmount emotional obstacles			1

the @entity0 : 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 in the last few years of dating , we 've come across 10 types of " emotionally stunted " guys -- adult men who may otherwise be awesome but for some reason never matured emotionally			1
these dudes are stuck in emotional " playpens " preventing them from forming healthy ( and intimate ) adult relationships and where the women in their lives are in the position of either pushing them around like toddlers in a baby carriage or screaming " get up and walk on your own ! " before heading out the door			1
usually , emotional immaturity is n't obvious right away			1
in the first few weeks and months of dating , as our best selves are presented , we 've found ourselves thinking , finally , a guy who is n't emotionally stunted ! he 's a man -- not a man - child ! but at some point , the curtain is pulled back just like in the " @entity37 " and , yup , his emotional issues are right there			1
the @entity0 : 12 stars posing using hands as bras do n't get us wrong : women can be emotionally stunted too			1

" @entity51 uh ! i 'm not emotionally stunted ! you 're the one with the problem , meanie ! " 2			1
" this is who i am and i like being this way			2
take it or leave it ! " to which we reply , " smell ya later			2
" and so should you			0

the @entity162 : initially , this gentleman comes off as exceedingly confident -- he thinks he 's the best at his job , takes good care of his appearance , and is often the life of the party			1
but he also can not take a joke at his expense , overstates how successful he is , and is never happy for anyone who 's doing " better " than him -- including the woman he 's with			1
the woman he wants : someone who wo n't ever challenge him or give him grief , even as a joke			1

the woman he wants : someone who reinforces his anger at his ex by committing the same " sins " she did			0

what he really needs : to find closure with the woman who " wronged him , " but not necessarily through confrontation			0
