in the early 1960s , a young postdoctoral student stumbled onto something that puzzled him			0
after reading the literature on cannabis , he was surprised to see that while the active compound in morphine had been isolated from opium poppies 100 years before and cocaine isolated from coca leaves around the same time , the active component of marijuana was still unknown			2
this simple observation launched his life 's work			1
that young @entity15 researcher , @entity14 , is now a heavily decorated scientist , recently nominated for the prestigious @entity16			1
more than 50 years ago , however , he had trouble starting his scientific journey			0
for starters , he needed cannabis to study and did n't know how to obtain it			2
eventually , he obtained his research supply from friends in the police department			0
the young scientist was in a hurry , and did n't want to wait to cut through the red tape required by @entity15 's @entity28			2
" yes , i broke the law , " he told me when i met with him in @entity30 last year , " but i apologized and explained what i was trying to do			0
" it 's a good thing the @entity15 government did n't stall his progress , because @entity14 was moving at breakneck speed			1
dr. @entity37 : " doubling down " on medical marijuana by 1963 , he determined the structure of cannabidiol ( @entity41 ) , an important component of marijuana			2
a year later , he became the first person to isolate delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity46 ) , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana			2
over the ensuing decades , @entity14 and his team continued to isolate numerous compounds from the cannabis plant			1
their work also went a long way toward illuminating how the drug works in the brain			0
when @entity14 's team identified the first known endogenous cannabinoid , a chemical actually made by the brain itself , he named it " anandamide			1
" in the @entity64 language , ananda means " supreme bliss , " which gives us some insight into what @entity14 thinks of cannabinoids overall			1
it was halfway through our long afternoon discussion that @entity14 , now 83 , pulled out a paper he had written in 1999 , describing something known as " the entourage effect			1
" think of it like this : there are more than 480 natural components found within the cannabis plant , of which 66 have been classified as " cannabinoids			1
" those are chemicals unique to the plant , including delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiols			0
there are , however , many more , including : -- @entity86 ( @entity87 ) ; -- @entity88 ( @entity89 ) ; -- other @entity90 ( @entity41 ) ; -- other @entity46 ( @entity46 ) ; -- @entity91 ( @entity91 ) and cannabinodiol ( @entity92 ) ; -- other cannabinoids ( such as @entity94 ( @entity95 ) , cannabielsoin ( @entity96 ) , cannabitriol ( @entity97 ) and other miscellaneous types )			0
other constituents of the cannabis plant are : nitrogenous compounds ( 27 known ) , amino acids ( 18 ) , proteins ( 3 ) , glycoproteins ( 6 ) , enzymes ( 2 ) , sugars and related compounds ( 34 ) , hydrocarbons ( 50 ) , simple alcohols ( 7 ) , aldehydes ( 13 ) , ketones ( 13 ) , simple acids ( 21 ) , fatty acids ( 22 ) , simple esters ( 12 ) , lactones ( 1 ) , steroids ( 11 ) , terpenes ( 120 ) , non-cannabinoid phenols ( 25 ) , flavonoids ( 21 ) , vitamins ( 1 ) , pigments ( 2 ) , and other elements ( 9 )			1
minister 's daughter : cannabis " a gift from @entity126 " here is the important point			2
@entity14 , along with many others , said he believes all these components of the cannabis plant likely exert some therapeutic effect , more than any single compound alone			1
while science has not yet shown the exact role or mechanism for all these various compounds , evidence is mounting that these compounds work better together than in isolation : that is the " entourage effect			1
" take the case of @entity144 , which is pure , synthetic @entity46			0
when the drug became available in the mid- 1980s , scientists thought it would have the same effect as the whole cannabis plant			1
but it soon became clear that most patients preferred using the whole plant to taking @entity144			0
researchers began to realize that other components , such as @entity41 , might have a larger role than previously realized			0
to better understand the concept of the entourage effect , i traveled to the secret labs of @entity159 , outside @entity160			1
in developing @entity163 , a cannabis - based drug to treat multiple sclerosis , the company 's chairman , dr. @entity161 , told me the company ran into some of the same obstacles that @entity144 faced			2
more than a decade of experiments revealed that a whole plant extract , bred to contain roughly the same amounts of @entity46 and @entity41 in addition to the other components in the plant , was more effective in reducing the pain and spasms of @entity178 than a medication made of a single compound			1
it could be that multiple individual compounds play a role , or it could be due to their interaction in the body ; it could also be combination of both , @entity161 said			0
now , maybe this all sounds obvious			0
after all , eating real fruits , vegetables and other plants provides better nutrition than just taking vitamin pills with one nutrient or mineral in each			0
science is showing us that we can likely say the same about cannabis			0
as we move forward with creating medicines , like @entity200 , for the patients who can benefit from cannabis -- this is an important point to keep in mind			0
unlike other drugs that may work well as single compounds , synthesized in a lab , cannabis may offer its most profound benefit as a whole plant , if we let the entourage effect flower , as @entity14 suggested more than a decade ago			1
" this was our only hope " : medical marijuana refugees			0

scientist @entity14 has made studying marijuana his life 's work
there are more than 480 natural components in the cannabis plant
" the entourage effect " means those components may work best together
