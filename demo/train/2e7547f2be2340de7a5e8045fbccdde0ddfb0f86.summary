@entity0 -- with its expansive steel skin , tall parasol - shaped concrete pillars , and huge vestigial coal hoppers , the 33,000 - square - meter @entity2 makes a grand impression in a former industrial site beside @entity0 's @entity8			1
launched at the end of march , the museum is the second and the largest private institution established by prominent @entity14 art collectors @entity15 and her husband @entity16			1
it has the potential to become @entity0 's equivalent of a @entity21 or a @entity22			0
yet as significant as it may someday be , the @entity23 is a mere spark in the explosion of @entity14 's ongoing museum boom			1
in 2010 , the @entity27 outlined a five - year plan that , among other things , aimed to see @entity14 's high - speed railway network reach 45,000 km and its number of museums increase to 3,500 nationwide			1
the idea that culture can be laid like train tracks may be moot , but there 's no question that this cultural infrastructure is being rapidly developed			1
by the end of 2013 , two years before deadline , @entity14 already exceeded its goal , tallying a total of 4,000 museums			1
" @entity44 " museum experts observe that @entity14 's strategy is focused on building new museums , while the problem of setting up quality exhibition programs and finding an audience is dealt with later			1
for the first phase of that strategy , the country is still in its early stages			0
" @entity14 plans to elevate the per - capita number of museums to equal international levels			1
the short - term goal is to have one museum per 250,000 people , " says @entity58 , director of @entity60 's @entity59 @entity58 calls this aggressive proliferation of institutions the " museumification " of @entity14			1
it is an aggressive plan to fast - forward the development of the cultural sphere			0
the @entity69 counted 3.12 museums per 100,000 people in 2011 , but this number took more than a century to achieve			0
one reason @entity14 is exceeding its museum building goals is that , in addition to state - run institutions , many new museums are being built to service corporate and private interests			1
property giants @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 have all built art museums to garner interest in their real estate developments			0
@entity0 's @entity86 provides propaganda in favor of smoking , while the @entity90 , widely celebrated for its design , was built so the owners could develop the land while satisfying a legal requirement that they continue to use the land in an industry - related way			1
@entity99 craze @entity14 's new museums are n't all concentrated on the country 's prosperous east coast			1
" the good quality museums are pretty well spread out , even in remote places , " says @entity103 , author of @entity104 in @entity14			1
" if you have an archaeological site in nowhere northern @entity14 you 're going to build a museum on top of it to protect that site			1
" " @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , where they 're trying to set up a new town , actually has two museums that are used as focal points in the urban planning of that city , much like a church or town hall would be used in the @entity123			0
" from an architectural perspective , @entity103 is enthusiastic about the quality of many of @entity14 's new museums			1
she cites the @entity127 -- " a beautiful little project right on the @entity130 border " -- as particularly impressive , as well as the @entity132 - designed @entity131 in @entity133			0
" @entity135 is not completely third - tier or anything but it 's not @entity138 or @entity0 , so for @entity132 to be building a huge museum there , for me , is something , " says @entity134			2
money matters monumental government institutions , such as the @entity143 , occupy some of the country 's most impressive buildings , but successful museums provide more than just awesome architecture			2
@entity103 cites private art museums such as the @entity81 in @entity0 and the @entity149 in @entity150 as institutions that have not only interesting architecture but also quality exhibitions and strong events programs			0
viewed holistically , @entity103 says , " a lot of the successes are private museums rather than the state - run museums			2
" @entity160 , the deputy director of the state - run @entity161 ( @entity164 ) museum , says : " the government is still in the process of developing a system for supporting established museums			2
" @entity160 helps to run the 41,000 - square - meter mega museum , often likened to another converted power station , the @entity171 in @entity172			0
it has no collection of its own , an annual budget of just rmb 20 million , and fewer than 10 staff to arrange exhibitions			0
" compared to public museum budgets in developed @entity183 countries , our exhibition budget is very low , " @entity160 says			0
the @entity185 's total income for 2012 - 2013 was nearly Â £ 158 million			1
that kind of big budget is able to draw in big crowds , such as the 4.8 million visitors in 2013			2
in @entity0 , the @entity164 received 380,000 visitors in that same year , a modest number for a city as large as @entity0			2
while the @entity164 is a young institution , having only opened in 2012			0
the activity of museum going itself remains relatively new in @entity14 , and these factors only emphasize the need for bigger budgets , better exhibition design and more effective outreach programs to build and educate a new audience			2
" i think necessarily in the development of @entity14 the ' hardware ' comes before the ' software , ' " says @entity103			2
there are models of that in industry and in housing			0
" she believes that museums here are often vanity projects , generating spectacular architecture but vast quantities of underutilized space			0
for the moment , she thinks @entity14 lacks enough experienced curators , researchers and museum directors , but that this is changing			2
" there continue to be more university - level programs established in @entity14 offering museum and curatorial studies , and more and more @entity14 students ( are traveling ) abroad for education in internationally established programs , " says @entity103			1
architectural legacy the danger of building a vast infrastructure network of any kind in anticipation of demand is that the demand does n't always arrive			0
there 's been notable unevenness in many areas of @entity14 's growth , with forests of apartment blocks and entire speculative cities lying empty			1
with many new museums devoid of visitors , the same could happen in the cultural sphere			2
the @entity246 research project is watching to see how museums in @entity14 might evolve			1
" are there new rolesâ € ” socially , culturally , politicallyâ € ” that the museum is playing ? what new architectural forms and spatial organizations are being invented to accommodate these new ambitions ? " @entity58 asks			0
and if museums in @entity14 do evolve into wholly different forms , what will happen to the buildings being built ? @entity103 says the new architecture is worthwhile , regardless of the ' museum ' label			1
" actually you do need a few places of beauty within this vast array of residential towers and boring office buildings			0
and i think the quality of a lot of these museums is just stunning , from both international architects and local architects			0
i think those buildings will remain -- whether they 're used as museums or not is a different question			0
the buildings themselves will be important for a long time			0

@entity14 counts 4,000 museums at the end of 2013 , meeting its five - year goal two years early
new museums promote culture but are also used for corporate *branding* and for *anchoring* @entity14 's new cities
what will become of these architectural wonders if the museums fail to attract visitors ?
