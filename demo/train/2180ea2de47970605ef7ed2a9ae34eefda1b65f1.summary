@entity0 -- labor unions must give nonmember workers " fresh notice " of unplanned increases in fees or assessments -- money that might be used for political purposes -- the @entity2 ruled thursday			1
the justices said those nonunion workers must be allowed to make an informed choice about how those kinds of fees are spent , allowing them to object and obtain a rebate			1
the 7 - 2 decision is a victory for @entity20 , a @entity21 state employee , who sought to opt out of a $ 12 million assessment imposed by the @entity23			1
she did not belong to @entity24 , unlike most of her fellow government workers			0
state law allows unions to charge nonmembers annual dues -- called " fair share fees " -- to help support the collective bargaining efforts on behalf of all government workers , including the majority of workers who belong to the @entity24			1
at issue was whether nonunion employees may be constitutionally required to pay special fees to a union to help cover things like political spending on ballot measures			2
after two ballot measures were added in a special state election in 2006 , the union decided to impose a 25 % supplemental , separate , and temporary increase in fees to " build a political fight - back fund			1
" the money , said officials , would be used " for a broad range of political expenses , including television and radio advertising , direct mail , voter registration , voter education , and get - out - the - vote activities in our work sites and in our communities across @entity21			1
" the high court noted nonunion members were not given a choice on whether they would " opt in " and pay into this special fund , and the money was taken directly out of their paychecks and pensions			1
about 28,000 current and former workers who were not members of @entity24 sued , and the high court supported them			2
" this aggressive use of power by the @entity24 is indefensible , " wrote justice @entity71			0
" we see no justification for the union 's failure to provide a fresh ... notice " of the special fee , whether it involves political activities or not			2
. " when a public - sector union imposes a special assessment of dues increase , the union must provide a fresh ... notice and may not exact any funds from nonunion members without their affirmative consent , " @entity71 added			0
the high court in past cases has ruled nonunion public sector workers can not be forced to pay for union activities not directly related to collective bargaining			0
that would include many kinds of political lobbying and advertising			0
justices @entity98 and @entity100 agreed with their more conservative colleagues that fair notice must be given for nonmembers to opt out of pure political lobbying by unions			1
but they said the majority went too far by ruling that the requirement applies to other kinds opt - out fee collections as well , which they said was never argued or briefed by the opposing parties			2
in complete dissent were justices @entity113 and @entity115			0
" if the union 's basic administrative system does not violate the @entity122 , then how could its special assessment have done so , " asked @entity113 , who delivered his dissent from the bench , a rarely exercised privilege			0
" i do not believe the @entity123 requires a second objection opportunity to those nonmembers who did not object the first time			0
" the case is @entity129 v. @entity23 ( 10 - 1121 ) .			0
