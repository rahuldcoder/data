-- @entity0 @entity2 correspondent @entity1 reported thursday that the @entity4 intelligence community has information that @entity7 artillery is firing into eastern @entity8			1
the artillery pieces shown in the released footage are @entity7 @entity12 130mm field guns with a range of a little over 16 miles			2
why would the @entity7 do this ? simple -- this fits into their plan to support @entity19 separatists in eastern @entity8			1
the end game ? i believe it is the eventual absorption of that region into the @entity7			2
the area in red on the map is where much of the fighting between the @entity8 government and the @entity19 rebels has been occurring over the last month			1
the separatists have downed several @entity8 military aircraft in this area as the fighting raged			2
it is also the area in which @entity37 was shot down in what most of us believe was a tragic case of mistaken identity and inept use of modern weaponry			0
over the past month , the @entity8 have been successful in pushing the rebels into a pocket near the @entity7 border			1
one of the key weapons used by the @entity8 is the @entity50 ground attack / close air support jet fighter			0
it is heavily armed and armored , meant to fly low and attack personnel and vehicles with a variety of weapons			0
flying low makes it vulnerable to ground fire , however , especially shoulder - launched @entity61 , which are the heat - seeking surface - to - air missiles in the rebels ' arsenal ( also supplied by the @entity7 )			2
@entity2 : @entity7 getting ready to send more powerful weaponry into @entity8 to address some of the vulnerability to ground fire , pilots can fly higher than the effective ranges of @entity61			1
defending against these higher - flying aircraft requires a more advanced and capable air defense system -- like the @entity72 ( called the " @entity72 " system by the @entity7 )			0
from a variety of reports , it appears that the @entity7 provided a @entity72 transporter - erector - launcher - and - radar ( @entity79 ) to the separatists			0
there is footage of an @entity83 being moved from this contested area toward the @entity7 border immediately after @entity86 was shot down			0
just three days before , on june 14 , the rebels shot down a @entity8 military @entity89 twin - turboprop cargo aircraft flying at an altitude of 21,000 feet			2
since this altitude is significantly above the range of the @entity61 in either the @entity8 or rebel arsenal , the obvious conclusion is that it was downed with a more capable system : the sa - 11 system supplied by the @entity7			1
that event alone should have set off alarm bells in the civil aviation community			0
the downing of any aircraft operating at that altitude presented a different threat scenario than would an area in which shoulder - fired missiles were the only threat to aviation			0
the subsequent -- and i believe mistaken -- downing of @entity86 forced the rebels and their @entity7 sponsors to remove the sa - 11 system from eastern @entity8 , although it is obvious to most observers what had happened			1
without the improved air defense umbrella provided by the @entity72 , the separatists found themselves again subject to effective @entity8 air strikes			0
on wednesday , two @entity8 @entity50 fighters were shot down while operating at an altitude of 17,000 feet -- just above the range of @entity61 , yet still at an altitude to deliver munitions with a degree of accuracy			0
the @entity8 believe the aircraft were downed with @entity72 - 11 missiles , but this time fired from inside @entity7 territory			1
the @entity72 has enough range to reach not only that altitude , but more than 20 miles into @entity8 territory			2
in a further development , on thursday it appeared that the @entity7 had also begun fire support for the rebels , firing artillery from inside @entity7 territory into eastern @entity8			1
while the @entity12 130mm field gun seen in the photos can reach out to about 16 miles , the @entity7 have other systems that can reach as far as 25 miles or more			0
this represents a significant change in the situation between @entity7 and @entity8			1
providing material support -- the money , weapons and training required to mount an effective insurgency -- to groups in foreign countries is a recognized method of assisting groups that are either carrying out your wishes or are furthering a foreign policy objective			0
we have done it routinely			0
@entity158 is a prime example			0
firing artillery rounds into another sovereign nation with whom you are not at war is another matter entirely			0
this would be an act of war , yes , but it underscores just how seriously the @entity7 ( read : president @entity170 ) view the survival of the @entity19 rebels in @entity8 and their hopes that their continued fighting will achieve a key foreign policy objective			1
@entity170 believes these rebels are his ticket to gradually acquiring eastern @entity8 without a @entity7 military invasion			1
this use of artillery in the midst of the international furor over the @entity86 incident demonstrates his seriousness			0
on friday , the @entity8 reportedly responded to the @entity7 artillery fire with mortar fire across the @entity7 border			1
this represents a significant escalation of the tensions along that border -- what was once an internal ( albeit externally supported ) conflict between @entity8 nationals and pro-russian separatists now has the trappings of a cross-border fight between two sovereign nations , one of which has immensely greater military power			1
both sides are calculating their next moves			0
from the @entity7 perspective , with its approximately 15,000 troops deployed along the border , this artillery fire is logical and almost obligatory support for ethnic @entity7 who they believe would rather be part of the @entity7			2
from the @entity8 perspective , this is @entity7 meddling in their internal affairs			2
military action from the @entity7 side will draw a @entity8 armed response			2
this is understandable , but the @entity8 need to ensure that they are not playing into @entity170 's game plan			1
at some point , the @entity7 may declare that they need to intervene to protect " @entity7 nationals in eastern @entity8			1
" sound far - fetched ? remember @entity219			0
@entity220 : @entity170 , just evil enough @entity222 : this tragedy is @entity7 's fault join us on @entity227 / @entity226 .			1

@entity4 intelligence officials say they believe @entity7 artillery is firing into eastern @entity8
@entity232 says the artillery firing is a significant escalation by the @entity7
he says @entity170 's concern is to protect the @entity19 rebels
@entity232 : *ultimately* , @entity170 may claim territory in eastern @entity8 to ' protect ' rebels
