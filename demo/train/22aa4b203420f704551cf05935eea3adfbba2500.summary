-- our favorite sunday of the year will arrive on february 2 , and we 're already armed with snacks and snark to dissect the best part of @entity5 : its commercials			1
there will be the usual deluge of movie trailers -- expect to see clips for @entity12 's " @entity16 " movie as well as @entity18 's " @entity17 " -- plus the ad spots shilling beer , @entity14 and everything else			2
here are seven clips that we 're looking forward to watching all over again : @entity21 's puppy love c'mon people			1
this has small furry creatures , adoption and interspecies bonding			2
we 've long awaited the moment when the @entity29 gives up on football and just makes the @entity31 the main event , and we consider this @entity21 commercial to be the first step toward that glorious day			1
the @entity36 steal a car the @entity36 are mostly around for fun , but they often sneak in a lesson or two while they 're at it			2
with their @entity29 commercial , they impart a very useful one : do not , under any circumstances , pull over for a @entity36 bus -- unless you want them to hijack your car			1
( on the other hand , if your car is hijacked by @entity36 , at least you 'll get a groovy song out of it			2
) @entity52 's ' @entity51 commercial we love this @entity55 ad for so many reasons , but we 're only going to give you our top three : 1 ) it stars @entity52			0
2 ) it stars @entity52 basically giving the " am i beer commercial hot ? " monologue we give ourselves every morning			0
3 ) it stars @entity52 giving the only appropriate response to that : " i mean i 'm hot ... but like ... beer commercial hot ? no. but i love a challenge			0
" the ' @entity68 ' reunion we have n't seen @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 -- aka " @entity68 's " @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 -- together like this since " @entity68 " went off the air almost 19 years ago , so excuse us while we 're going to soak up as much of this minireunion as possible			2
if we 're lucky , maybe @entity70 and @entity71 will join @entity79 in his @entity81 spokesman duties full - time			0
' draft day ' trailer if the marketing team behind @entity18 's upcoming dramedy " @entity17 " did n't find a way to advertise during the @entity29 , we 'd question their devotion to the job			1
the film , directed by @entity90 and also starring @entity91 and @entity92 , features @entity18 as the general manager of the @entity94 as he grapples with the responsibility of having the no. 1 draft pick			0
we 're getting shades of " @entity98 " from this movie , and we like it			0
' @entity16 ' trailer admittedly , the promotion for " @entity16 " is a bit of a downer ( # @entity105 ? that 's a great thought to have during the @entity29 ) , but we ca n't help but be excited to see what @entity12 's going to do with this classic @entity108 story			1
stars include @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
the film will arrive in theaters on march 28			0
@entity92 's @entity116 commercial , with bears @entity118 is a self - described fan of the new @entity116 app , and she shot a @entity29 ad to show just how much she loves it			1
playing what appears to be a modern - day @entity124 who likes to hang out at a place called @entity127 ( we think we 've been there ... ) , @entity118 grooves to pop music with some hipster bears			0
which commercials are you looking forward to watching on sunday ? are you a @entity29 ad expert ?			1

part of the fun of the @entity29 is watching the ads
a number of them have been *released* before the big game
these seven are ones we ca n't wait to watch again
