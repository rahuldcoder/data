@entity0 -- the @entity2 did not participate in harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists detained in @entity5 , @entity6 or @entity7 , said a @entity9 investigation released tuesday			1
an april 2007 photo shows a room at @entity5 that had been used for interrogations			1
the investigation also concluded that the bureau generally reported potentially illegal actions by the @entity16 and @entity17			2
in " only a few instances " did @entity2 agents use techniques that were not approved by @entity2 policies , according to the report by inspector general @entity23			1
@entity23 criticized the @entity2 for being slow in developing and distributing its interrogation policy to its interrogators			2
though the the @entity2 decided to avoid harsh techniques in august 2002 , the decision was not put in writing until 2004 , when the bureau also put in writing that the harsh techniques used by other agencies should be reported to @entity2 superiors			1
the 2002 decision by fbi director @entity35 was that the bureau would adhere to restrictions used in interrogations of detainees within the @entity40			0
those techniques prohibit coercion , abuse or threats			0
the policy is based on the belief that building a rapport with prisoners is the best way to gain intelligence , according to tuesday 's report			0
the @entity2 issued a statement saying it is " gratified " by the report 's findings , and @entity35 promised that the bureau will continue to use " rapport - building techniques in interviews " of detainees			1
the inspector general 's investigators interviewed almost all of the more than 1,000 @entity2 employees who were deployed to one or more military zones between 2001 and 2004 , the report said			1
the vast majority of the agents adhered to @entity2 policies and separated themselves from other agencies ' interrogators who were using techniques that the @entity2 did n't approve of , the report said			1
the report listed " a few incidents " that " clearly would not be permissible for @entity2 agents to use in the @entity40 , " including isolating a prisoner from human contact and participating in an interrogation in which detainees were " given a ' drink of water ' in a forceful and inappropriate manner			1
" it also listed incidents that were not " clear violations of @entity2 policy " but which should have raised questions			2
some agents participated in a program of subjecting detainees to frequent cell relocations , the report said			0
in another case , two agents joined in an interview in which a detainee 's hands and feet were " short - chained " close together for several hours , during which time the prisoner urinated on himself			0
@entity2 agents reported that @entity97 interrogators engaged in sleep deprivation or sleep disruption techniques , which include using bright lights , loud music and extreme temperatures " to keep detainees awake or otherwise wear down their resistance			1
" no @entity2 agents witnessed the abuses at @entity106 , the @entity108 - operated @entity107 correctional facility where some prisoners were physically and sexually abused , sparking outrage when photos of the abuse became public			0
however , the report said , an @entity2 agent said he witnessed a naked @entity106 prisoner forced to roll between rows of cells			1
he did not report the incident because he did n't know whether it was an acceptable technique			0
the report also said @entity2 personnel did not witness the controversial waterboarding technique , which the @entity16 has confirmed was used on three prisoners			2
the @entity2 protested when it witnessed techniques used by the military and the @entity16 in questioning top terror suspects @entity127 and @entity128 , according to the report			1
in one instance , an agent objected to using a snarling dog to interrogate @entity128			0
despite some criticism , the inspector general offered the @entity2 modest praise at the conclusion of his three - year investigation			2
" we believe that while the @entity2 could have provided clearer guidance earlier , and while the @entity2 could have pressed harder for resolution of concerns about detainee treatment by other agencies , the @entity2 should be credited for its conduct and professionalism in detainee interrogations in the military zones in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , and in generally avoiding participation in detainee abuse , " the report concluded			1
the inspector general 's investigation did not quiet the @entity2 's chief critics			2
the @entity154 said @entity2 leaders failed to uphold their obligation to " bring an end to the abuse and application of illegal interrogation methods			0
" rep. @entity161 , @entity163 - @entity162 , chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the @entity2 , criticized then - attorney general @entity165 and his deputy , @entity166			0
@entity161 said @entity2 agents ' objections to certain interrogation methods " fell on deaf ears			0
" " the admirable actions taken by those brave @entity2 agents willing to speak out were undermined by those who led them , " he said .			0

@entity9 investigation finds @entity2 generally acted *responsibly*
@entity177 looked at interrogations at @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7
investigators find " only a few instances " of *unapproved* techniques by @entity2
@entity2 " could have provided clearer guidance earlier , " report acknowledges
