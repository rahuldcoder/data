-- @entity2 's military has notched an important success for president @entity4 with the arrest of @entity6 , the reputed boss of the powerful @entity8 drug cartel			1
@entity11 , nicknamed " @entity12 , " was captured without a fight in the coastal city of @entity15 , in the border state of @entity17 , @entity10 spokesman @entity9 said thursday			1
wednesday 's arrest -- together with the seizure of weapons , vehicles and jewels -- is a much needed achievement for @entity4 , whose offensive against drug cartels has done little to stem drug - related violence or the volume of drugs transported through @entity2			2
the mustachioed @entity11 , handcuffed and wearing a checkered long - sleeve shirt under a bulletproof vest , was presented before reporters			2
@entity2 marines chased a vehicle of armed men into a residence in @entity15 , where they " surprised " @entity11 and arrested him , @entity9 said			1
@entity11 is said to head a criminal group considered the third-most powerful in @entity2			1
" @entity42 is an important actor , " said @entity37 , professor of government at the @entity39 and expert of drug cartels			0
" his capture is a tremendous blow to the @entity8 cartel			0
" five others were arrested with @entity11 , and of five of his bodyguards were arrested after a shootout in a separate city , @entity9 said			2
some of them wore camouflage uniforms when they were presented next to @entity11			0
there are rewards in @entity2 and the @entity55 for @entity11 's arrest			1
@entity11 has been indicted in the @entity55 , accused of drug trafficking and threatening @entity55 law enforcement officials in november 1999			1
in that incident , according to the @entity59 , @entity11 and other suspected @entity61 leaders allegedly stopped federal agents and pointed @entity65 rifles at them			1
the agents were allowed to leave after a standoff			0
the @entity59 offered a reward of up to $ 5 million for information leading to @entity11 's arrest			2
in @entity2 , where @entity11 is on the government 's list of the 37 most - wanted traffickers , officials offered more than $ 2 million for his capture			1
while not as powerful as it once was , the @entity61 is one of @entity2 's major drug trafficking organizations			1
@entity11 assumed a top role after the arrest of former @entity61 boss @entity80 and became the top leader after a rift with @entity84 ' relatives in the organization , authorities have said			1
as @entity11 rose in the cartel hierarchy , the group controlled smuggling routes in northeastern @entity2 by using its enforcement arm , known as @entity90 , authorities have said			1
but @entity90 later split into its own violent cartel , and for several years has been fighting the @entity61 for the lucrative turf			0
" @entity42 survived internal divisions and directed violent confrontations in @entity17 and @entity95 against his former allies , @entity90 , " @entity9 said			0
the arrest is the latest in a series of blows against the @entity61 , based in the city of @entity101 , across the border from @entity103 , @entity104			0
this month , @entity105 , reputed leader of the @entity8 faction loyal to the @entity84 family , was also arrested by the military			0
@entity11 's arrest was the result of " intense intelligence " work by the @entity10 , and information gleaned from @entity84 ' arrest , @entity9 said			1
the rival @entity90 , who operate in the same northeastern part of the country , may seem poised to take advantage of their rival 's vulnerability			0
but @entity37 said internal divisions within the @entity90 will prevent them from turning the heat up on the @entity8 cartel , and that the @entity125 will be the trafficking group most likely to strengthen its position			0
in the past , surges in violence have been recorded after the killing or capture of cartel bosses			0
@entity133 rifts within the @entity8 cartel and @entity90 could lead to fights and alliances in a " kaleidoscope situation , " @entity37 said			0
the other big winner is the @entity10 and its marines , who again proved they are effective at going after high - profile targets , he said			2
in 2009 , the marines were responsible for another of the @entity4 administration 's biggest gets when they killed kingpin @entity145 in a shootout			0
the @entity147 has provided intelligence to @entity2 authorities during several operations , including the one that brought an end to @entity145			2
but the arrest of @entity11 was a " @entity2 operation , " said the @entity55 drug agency 's spokesman , @entity156			1
" obviously when a major cartel leader is arrested and brought to justice , it is significant			0
@entity147 congratulates the government of @entity2 and their brave military for their continued success in apprehending top drug traffickers , " @entity156 said .			2

new : this was a @entity2 operation , the @entity147 says
the @entity10 says it has arrested @entity6
@entity11 is said to be the leader of the @entity61
*multimillion* - *dollar* rewards were offered for his capture in @entity2 and the @entity55
