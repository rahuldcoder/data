as @entity0 read about the flood of private money that is going into the current presidential campaign , most ca n't help but shake their heads in disgust about how our democracy functions			1
with all the talk about changing @entity10 , voters are shrewd enough to understand that if contributors give this much money to the candidates in both parties , there is little chance that @entity10 will be much different in 2013			1
in depth : where money and politics collide @entity0 tend to be cynical that campaign finance reform will ever work			1
the conventional assumption is that politicians will never be willing to fix the system and they will circumvent any laws that come their way			2
trust in government continues to plummet			0
yet we must remember that there have been moments when positive change happened			0
the most important episode in the history of campaign finance reform took place in the aftermath of the @entity37 that brought down president @entity38			1
although @entity37 was about a break - in to @entity42 campaign headquarters and the coverup that followed , the congressional investigations revealed the ways in which interest groups donated campaign funds with the hope of shaping policy and how politicians , including @entity38 's advisers , circumvented existing laws			1
the scandal prompted @entity53 to finally tackle these bigger issues about campaigns			2
as then sen. @entity56 explained , " @entity37 is n't the question			1
@entity37 is merely a vehicle through which we can get through what we originally could not get through because the fellows on the other team are in a very compromising position as a consequence of it			1
" @entity53 passed legislation that established contribution and spending limits , public financing for presidential elections and an independent elections commission			1
during the next two decades , the system for funding presidential elections proved to be remarkably effective			1
the system provided partial funds during the primaries and full funding during the general election			2
to receive the taxpayer funds , candidates had to agree to abide by restrictions on how much they could spend and how much they could receive from private sources			0
candidates in both parties agreed to the system			2
though it was far from perfect , the reforms had a big impact in reducing the power of private money			2
former @entity42 power broker @entity91 and former secretary of defense and @entity94 congressman @entity93 concluded in 1986 : " public financing of presidential elections has clearly proved its worth in opening up the process , reducing the influence of individuals and groups , and virtually ending corruption in presidential election finance			1
" this was not the only reform that made a difference			0
disclosure laws enacted in the 1970s have produced a much more transparent process that allows voters and reporters to easily find out about where money is coming from and how much is being spent			0
the nation has come a far distance from the 1950s when there was virtually no data on the sources of campaign finance			0
over time , the system for publicly financed presidential elections did break down			1
during the 1980s and 1990s , donors found loopholes to move money into the campaigns			1
as fewer @entity0 checked the box on their tax returns to donate their money to the system , the amount of funds available seemed meager compared to what candidates could raise on the fundraising circuit			1
the lure of massive campaign funds proved to be too great			0
in 2000 , @entity135 candidate @entity135 did not take public money so that he could free himself from any restrictions			2
in 2004 , democrats @entity138 and @entity139 did not take public funds for their primary runs either			0
four years later , @entity142 and @entity143 did the same for the primaries , and @entity143 did so for the general election			0
although efforts to stop funding the public campaign budget have failed , president @entity143 and whoever runs for the @entity94 will continue the path set out in 2008			0
public funds are now irrelevant			0
the constraints that came with those funds are gone , and overall limits on private campaign fundraising have been weakened by court decisions			0
it is time for the parties to look again at the system that @entity53 put in place in 1974			0
while the system was far from perfect and eventually fell apart , it is notable that there was a substantial period of time when reforms reined in the power of money in politics			1
it turned out that , for a time , politicians -- with the promise of public funds to cover the cost of their campaigns -- were willing to abandon the toxic fundraising circuit that otherwise consumed most of their time			2
it is time for reform once again			0
the nation must remember the lessons from @entity37 -- not just what went wrong , but also how @entity53 was able to improve the way in which we govern in response to a scandal that rocked the nation			2
