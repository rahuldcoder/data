-- in the twinkle of an eye , @entity1 has accomplished what most athletes would be happy to achieve in an entire career -- and in his case he has done it in three sports			1
since bursting onto the scene in 2007 , the @entity10 has made his considerable presence felt in not one but three oval - ball codes , weighing in with match - winning performances in @entity16 , @entity18 football and , most recently , @entity19			1
still only 25 , @entity1 is now reaching his athletic peak and keen for the second half of his career to be just as successful as the first in which he has become a try scorer par excellence			1
" everything 's going to plan , the way i would have liked it , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity26			1
" there 's hopefully a long way to go in my career			1
" affectionately known as " @entity1 , " @entity1 was born in the @entity34 suburb of @entity35 to parents of @entity38 descent			1
one of six siblings , @entity1 recalls being encouraged to participate in sports from an early age			1
" they were a very , very big part of my career growing up			2
i think probably all of my determination and eagerness to want to play professional sport came from my family			0
" @entity1 began his professional @entity16 career at the age of 17 , scoring a record 36 tries for @entity52 in his rookie season			1
his raw talent earned him a call - up to the national squad becoming the youngest - ever player to represent the @entity58 -- though his record of 18 years and 194 days was recently eclipsed by @entity60			2
the following year , he rubber - stamped his status as an emerging star with a further 37 tries in 39 games , this time for the @entity65			1
it was incredible start by any measure , but @entity1 took it all in his stride			2
" i probably realized when i was maybe 13 years of age that i could make a living out of playing professional sport and from that time on it was really a goal for me do that as soon as i can			0
" intimidating presence weighing in at just over 100 kg ( 220 lbs ) and standing 1.95 m ( 6 ' 5 " ) tall , @entity1 is , like his childhood idol , former @entity74 winger @entity73 , an intimidating physical presence on the pitch			2
a hefty frame allied to explosive turns of speed make @entity1 a real handful for opposition defenses			1
he is also incredibly agile for a big man , capable of salmon - like leaps to catch the high ball			2
" i get excited when the ball goes up in the air			0
i try to always get up there ... i get a buzz out of it			0
i am always trying to work at it			0
" having excelled at both club and international levels -- he scored six tries in eight appearances for the @entity58 -- @entity1 inevitably attracted the attention of @entity19 scouts			1
but rather than making what has become a routine switch between the 13 and 15 - man codes , @entity1 opted to take a detour , signing for @entity101 ( @entity101 ) side , the @entity102 in 2011			1
" there are different reasons why i wanted to try @entity101 -- some of them family reasons and others were more personal ones , " he explains of a route taken by only a handful of @entity106 players in the past			2
" i wanted to challenge myself , you know , take myself out of my comfort zone			0
" his two seasons in @entity101 did n't hit the heights reached in @entity16 but , as he has admitted in previous interviews , it was extremely rewarding financially			2
it was n't just his bank balance that profited though , his all - round game did too , he says			2
" my time in @entity101 improved my kicking and , you know , i dropped a lot of weight when i was playing @entity101 , so i got to be a lot fitter			0
it has helped me a lot , " he said			0
union star a comparatively quiet period in @entity101 exploded back into life when @entity1 signed for the @entity19 side @entity131 for the 2013 season			1
cementing his place at fullback , @entity1 impressed with 20 tries in his debut season and he was drafted into the international squad to face the @entity138 touring side			2
@entity1 's impact was immediate as he ran in two tries -- the second a sensational solo effort that lit up the @entity144 's @entity143 -- earning him the @entity146 award			1
@entity1 would end the year scoring a total of 10 international tries , equaling the @entity10 record for a season set by @entity151 in 2004			1
to date , he has scored 17 times in 29 appearances			0
show - stopping cameos on the pitch have inevitably increased his profile off it , but @entity1 has remained focused , says former @entity159 coach , @entity158			1
" sometimes success can get in the way and people get confused , sidetracked and distracted , but he 's just a very consistent operator , " @entity160 told the @entity161 in august			0
" he 's difficult to contain			0
if you can get him in a one - on - one situation , he 's going to get you a pretty good outcome			2
" he 's a pretty big guy , he 's got good skills , and he 's pretty measured off the field			0
he 's a very quiet , humble guy who is always smiling and laughing			0
" after being voted @entity171 in 2013 , @entity1 was honored again this year , winning the @entity172 -- an annual award given to the best @entity10 player of the year			1
@entity1 's talents seem to ensure that he will be singled out for some time to come , but it 's being part of a team that he enjoys the most			1
" it 's the best thing about it			0
you know , you get to enjoy the ups and downs together as a team , so you ride the emotions together			0
for me , i really enjoy the camaraderie and the things that you form within the team			0
" with a @entity192 in @entity193 to look forward to next year , @entity1 and his teammates will be aiming to win the @entity195 trophy for a third time			1
given the @entity171 recent run of form -- a disappointing five - match tour of @entity200 in november yielded just two victories -- that looks unlikely , but whatever happens @entity1 wo n't be taking his foot off the gas as he looks to continue repaying the sporting debt owed to his family			1
" coming to @entity159 from overseas to try and give us an opportunity to make something out of living in @entity159 was a huge thing for me so i wanted to probably give back a bit , " he says			0
" in a way i wanted to work hard and play at a professional level to help them out			0
it 's always been a key part of my success and always will be to the day of my retirement			0
