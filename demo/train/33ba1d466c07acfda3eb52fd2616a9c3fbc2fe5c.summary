the admitted mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks has issued a rambling defense of @entity4 's son - in - law , on trial in @entity6 for allegedly being @entity8 's propagandist in the wake of the attacks			1
in a rare statement made public , @entity11 said @entity13 -- an @entity14 preacher whom the @entity15 has charged with conspiracy to kill @entity15 nationals and providing material support to terrorists -- is falsely accused of being involved in @entity8 's military activities			1
@entity11 said @entity13 was more of a visiting celebrity who preached the @entity22 to @entity8 recruits			1
@entity11 's 14 - page statement was in response to questions from @entity13 's attorney and was filed in @entity28 in @entity29 on sunday night			1
@entity13 was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged @entity8 operatives sheltered in @entity32			2
he was arrested in @entity33 and deported to @entity34 via @entity35 , which helped @entity15 agents capture him			0
the @entity6 trial , blocks from the site of the former @entity40 destroyed in the 9/11 attacks , has already featured testimony about previous @entity8 operations , including the 2001 shoe bomb attempt , which @entity15 authorities say @entity13 knew about beforehand			2
@entity11 , the most senior @entity8 leader in @entity15 custody , used the statement to lecture the @entity15 about its errors in supporting jihadists in their fight during the 1980s against the @entity52 's forces in @entity53 , realizing too late the level of training ongoing in mujahedeen camps			1
" @entity57 destroyed his own country by his own hand with his stupid foreign policy , " @entity11 said in his statement			1
@entity11 has taken full or partial credit for planning multiple operations beyond 9/11 , from the 1998 @entity15 embassy bombings in @entity64 to the post- 9/11 shoe bombing and the murder of @entity68 reporter @entity67			0
@entity13 , @entity11 said , was a " pious man " and among many scholars drawn to @entity53 when the @entity69 took control of the country in the mid- 1990s			0
he describes @entity53 during those years as something of a paradise , with strict @entity14 laws making the country safe from crime			0
he said he does n't recall meeting @entity13 and that , as a scholar and preacher , @entity13 would n't have known about military operations , in part because @entity8 was careful to restrict access to such information			1
" he did not play any military role and to the best of my knowledge he did not receive any military training at any of the training camps for the mujahedeen in @entity53 , " @entity11 said			0
" i personally never spoke with sheikh @entity13 about the shoe bomb operation , " he said , adding that @entity57 claims about @entity13 's role of issuing public sermons and statements after 9/11 do n't indicate involvement in planning @entity8 attacks			2
" those tasked with giving statements to the media do not necessarily know all the details of an operation and are sometimes even unaware of the very existence of the operation			0
" @entity11 also tried to undermine @entity15 allegations that @entity13 took an oath of allegiance , or swore " bayat , " to @entity4			1
he said that swearing such an oath does n't mean a person is to carry out an operation			0
" to tell the truth , i do not even know if ( @entity13 ) personally swore bayat to ( @entity4 ) or not , " he said			0
@entity13 's attorney said in his court filing that @entity11 's statement is a piece of important exculpatory evidence			2
he had requested @entity115 to testify via video , but @entity15 restrictions and @entity11 's own refusal to personally testify prompted the written questions and response			2
what did @entity13 tell authorities on plane trip to @entity15 ?			0

@entity11 answers questions in @entity14 preacher 's conspiracy case
@entity13 -- @entity4 's son - in - law -- *facing* conspiracy , terrorism charges
@entity11 said @entity13 was scholar , preacher with no role in @entity8 's military affairs
@entity11 also used the statement to blast @entity15 foreign policy
