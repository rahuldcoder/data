as the sun set over @entity0 , police were still searching the downtown offices of @entity71 , another @entity57 media outlet			0

the conflict has claimed more than 30,000 lives , most of them members of the country 's long - oppressed ethnic @entity12 minority			0
over the last year , @entity4 authorities began rounding up suspects accused of being affiliated with a @entity80 - linked organization referred to as the @entity89 in @entity90 ( @entity91 )			2

i am willing to pay any price for that			0
" among the growing chorus of voices reacting in outrage to police raids on friday was @entity4 's @entity196 , which announced in a written statement that its member @entity198 had been detained			1
" pressure on the press and freedom of expression is increasing day by day , " the association wrote			2
" these pressures and attacks on journalists and media organizations increase fear and the heavy climate of auto - censorship , while also putting @entity4 in a second - class category internationally			1
" " this ongoing clampdown is all about using terrorism laws very widely and indiscriminately against people who are not terrorists , " said @entity61 of @entity52			1
" you 've got bad laws and at the moment a government that shows no sign of slowing down in its support of these types of operations which are basically against ordinary people , civil society and journalists			2
it 's hard to see how this is a legitimate fight against terrorism			0
