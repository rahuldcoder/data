more than a year ago , @entity0 was browsing online and came across a missing children 's website			1
to his astonishment , after clicking through the pages , he found himself			2
what followed was a yearlong story of self - discovery			2
@entity0 , a 35 - year - old software salesman , was adopted at age 4 from an orphanage in @entity10			1
when he grew up , got married and thought about having his own children , the @entity12 resident grew more curious about his own roots			1
" @entity15 covered @entity17 's story			0
it popped up on my @entity20 , and right from there i went to the center 's website , " @entity0 said , referring to the @entity18			1
@entity17 , an @entity24 woman who made headlines last year after she found her own baby picture on the website , discovered that she had been kidnapped as a 3 - week - old infant from a @entity30 hospital in 1987 by a woman posing as a nurse			1
she reunited with her biological family in an emotional meeting last january			0
reading @entity17 's tale , @entity0 said , made him wonder about his own			1
on a hunch , he clicked on @entity18 in hopes of answering the unanswered questions about his origins			1
it was there he found an age - progression image made from a photograph of him as an infant			1
@entity0 recognized himself immediately , he said , and contacted the @entity45			1
" i let them know my info and they ran with it , " he said			0
" they were the ones who did all the legwork " of investigating the case			0
@entity0 then volunteered for a dna test in february 2011			1
eight months later its findings revealed fragments of his story and the name he 'd been given at birth : @entity62 @entity61			0
his biological father , @entity63 , reported him missing more than three decades ago after his mother , @entity64 , took him for a walk and did n't return			0
@entity0 says he believes @entity64 put him in the @entity67 orphanage and told authorities his name was @entity70			1
@entity15 could not independently confirm that account			0
@entity63 , who now lives in @entity72 with his two daughters , was not immediately available for comment , and @entity64 's whereabouts are unknown			0
this january , @entity0 decided to contact his newfound relatives over the phone			2
" they knew i had been located , but they were very surprised , " @entity0 said , describing the experience as " a lot to digest			2
" " you see a lot of these reunion stories and a day later they 're meeting their parents , " he said			0
" i 'm still going forward , testing the waters			0
" @entity0 says that while he intends to meet his kin at some point , he also wants to uncover what happened in the three - week period between his reported disappearance and his arrival at the orphanage in @entity94			1
and yet authorities say stories like @entity0 's and @entity17 's are rare			2
thousands of children under the age of 18 go missing each year , the center for missing children reported			2
many of those youths are considered runaways and return home , though hundreds of the long - term missing often prove far more difficult to track down			0
" we encourage folks who have doubts to look on the website , " said @entity106 , the center 's executive director			0
@entity0 described his experience as " a happy ending to a story that usually is n't a happy ending			2
" " good things do happen , " he said .			0
