-- today we can tell the remarkable story of @entity3 , a 15 - year - old @entity4 schoolgirl			1
last october @entity3 was travelling home from school with her friend @entity7 when a @entity9 gunman boarded their bus and shot both of them			1
@entity7 suffered head and facial injuries and had to be rushed to hospital in the @entity16			2
shot in the neck and arm , @entity3 spent a month in hospital while her deep wounds healed			1
both were attacked by terrorists who wanted to stop girls going to school			0
@entity3 dreams of being a doctor			2
fighting back from her injuries , she attempted to resume her schooling at home in the @entity29			0
so keen was she to return to school at the earliest opportunity that she ignored continuing threats to her life from the same @entity9 terrorists who shot her and @entity7			1
for months she has had to be escorted to school each day by two armed guards			2
her home has had to be protected by police			0
sadly , the more that @entity3 spoke up , the more the threats escalated , making it difficult for her and her family to remain secure			1
and in the past few weeks violence has escalated across @entity4			2
a female teacher was gunned down in front of her young son as she drove into her all girls ' schools			0
a school principal was killed and his pupils severely injured when a bomb was thrown into a school playground in an all - girls school in @entity52 just as a prize giving ceremony began			0
only ten days ago , in a massacre which will long be remembered as the single worst terrorist assault on girls ' education in recent years , the bus in which 40 female students were travelling from their all - girls college campus in @entity57 was blown up by a suicide bomber			0
so violent was the terrorist attack that another group followed the injured girls to hospital and opened fire on them again			0
despite the public revulsion against the violence , the attacks have continued			0
only this weekend two schools were blown up , while another two girls were murdered for posting a video in which they were filmed dancing in the rain			0
it is because of events like these that , with her family 's support , @entity3 feels forced to leave the country if she is to have the education she needs			1
tomorrow she will resume her schooling in the @entity16 after being flown over to @entity86 last weekend and reunited with her lifelong friend @entity7			1
i first spoke to @entity3 last november , a month after the attempted assassination			2
she told me then of her determination to persevere and to speak up for a girl 's right to education			0
she called education the light that brightens up girls ' lives			0
and when i met her off the plane from @entity98 on saturday night , she told me that she wanted every girl to have the chance of an education			0
her dream , she said , was to build schools so that every out - of - school girl could develop their talents and fulfil their potential			0
according to @entity110 , 700,000 school - age children in @entity7 and @entity3 's home province of @entity109 ( @entity109 ) are not at school today - and 600,000 are girls			1
they are some of the 32 million girls worldwide denied a place at school			0
in total , 500 million girls of school age will never complete their education			0
this makes the battle for education for every girl the civil rights struggle of our generation			0
and until we provide both the resources and security for girls to travel to school and feel safe from the @entity9 , then many of @entity4 's schools will remain closed			1
the biggest force for change today is the courage of @entity7 and now @entity3 and girls like them , who are no longer prepared to acquiesce in their subjugation			1
it is their courage that we will celebrate when at the @entity142 on july 12th , the day of @entity7 's sixteenth birthday , we will hold @entity7			1
a youth resolution will be passed demanding that world leaders provide the resources to get every child to school			1
now with a new petition launched by @entity7 on a world at school , young people themselves from around the world are becoming more vociferous in fighting for their right to education than the adults who for centuries have been charged with delivering it			1
go not just to @entity4 , where i met many of the million - strong @entity7 demonstrators demanding a girl 's right to school			1
travel to @entity164 and you 'll find girls who have created ' child marriage free zones ' , preventing themselves being kept from school in a loveless marriage they did not choose			2
visit @entity170 , where girls are fighting child slavery with the @entity173 for @entity174			0
attend the marches in @entity176 led by child labourers , demanding not just an end to this form of slavery , but the delivery of their right to learn			2
@entity184 : @entity7 's journey from near death to recovery we saw how in the wake of the attack on @entity7 and @entity3 , over three million people -- including a million out - of - school @entity4 children -- signed petitions calling for children to be able to go to school			1
this powerful movement is supported by international campaigns such as @entity203 's because i am a @entity200 , started by @entity202 's @entity201			2
as we shift from the 20th century movement of women 's emancipation to the 21st century campaign for women 's empowerment , girls sense that the future is theirs			0
and it is this new liberation movement , led by girls , that we will celebrate in ten days ' time when @entity7 addresses the @entity142			1
november 2012 : @entity7 spurs school - for - all vow , now deliver october 2012 : millions of children face @entity7 's fight for an education			1
