@entity1 , @entity0 -- cannibalism , @entity5 tigers and a good dose of @entity8 humor : these are the ingredients of the latest film from down under , the intriguingly titled " @entity11			1
" left to right : producer @entity12 , writer / producer @entity13 , director @entity14 , and actors @entity15 and @entity17 the film is inspired by the story of @entity20 , who , in the 1820s , escaped from one of the most feared penal colonies in @entity5 and survived in the bush by eating his fellow escapees			1
" @entity11 " suggests that " @entity27 " @entity20 's descendents today live deep in the jungle , feeding off the flesh of innocent travelers			2
director , @entity14 , @entity8 - born but raised in the @entity32 , hopes that his first feature - length film has managed to steer clear of typical horror cliches			1
" you have to acknowledge there is a certain formula [ to the horror genre ] , but at the same time you need a point of difference			0
i wanted to present characters that were credible , that had depth , " he told @entity2			1
to further break away from convention , @entity14 has tried to make sure that this is not a typical @entity8 film			1
the cast do n't " feel " @entity8 and it is set in lush jungle , not a red desert			1
the @entity8 lead sports an @entity52 accent , while in the jungle of @entity5 there is n't a kangaroo or cork hat in sight			1
" i was very conscious of giving it a commercially viable feel by being international without being parochial , " @entity14 explained			2
" i think there is a real danger of @entity8 films becoming particularly art house because they present @entity8 as battlers of the outback			2
" @entity14 questions whether @entity69 's upcoming blockbuster , " @entity8 , " is doing anything to change this image : " that movie deals with the slightly stereotypical image of @entity8 being a land of the farmer and the ground and the cattle , " he told @entity2			1
" @entity11 , " as a horror , is already breaking from what most people consider an @entity8 film			1
" @entity84 , " " @entity85 " and " @entity86 " are the films typically associated with the @entity8 film industry			2
but comedy 's hold on @entity8 has loosened in recent years			2
since 2000 @entity8 has produced a series of successful horror flicks , culminating in 2005 's " @entity91			2
" made for a mere $ 1 million , it became the highest grossing @entity8 horror film of all time , making over $ 16 million at the @entity95 box office alone			1
neighboring @entity96 has also had a run of successful horror films in recent years			0
before @entity100 took over @entity101 with his band of hobbits , he made his name in his homeland with 80 's classic gore - fests , " @entity108 " and " @entity107			0
" a huge success internationally , the films have since spawned a whole generation of new horror directors in @entity96			0
even after nearly twenty years , @entity100 's films remain hugely influential			0
2006 's " @entity116 , " a film about genetically modified killer sheep , owed much to " @entity107 " and used @entity100 's special effects company , @entity115			0
horror has also seen a revival globally			0
" @entity122 " , written by @entity11 's own @entity17 , grossed $ 55 million in the @entity95 and has since spawned three sequels			0
the popularity of the series generated numerous other torture fests that seem to develop increasingly elaborate ways to mutilate hapless teenagers			0
it is a tough ask to make your film stand out in such a saturated market , and you have to wonder how a film that in essence deals with four adults going out into a haunted wilderness can really be unique			0
@entity14 believes he 's done that by focusing on the film 's characters : " a community that seems normal but has some twisted alternative philosophy , which makes a much more horrific film , " he grins			1
and @entity14 believes the setting has helped			0
@entity5 , an island that has rarely featured in films , has a rich history and a varied landscape			0
would @entity14 , after spending so much time on the island , recommend it as place to visit ? " bits of @entity5 are phenomenal in their beauty , " he said			1
" with that hanging mist , steep gradients and valleys , it 's truly mythical			0

" @entity11 " is an @entity8 horror film set in the @entity5 jungle
a group of *researchers* go looking for the @entity5 tiger but find cannibals instead
director @entity14 hopes he has delivered scares while *avoiding* horror cliches
