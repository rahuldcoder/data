@entity0 -- @entity3 's top diplomat has warned that the @entity4 disputes risk becoming " @entity3 's @entity10 " , deteriorating into a violent conflict that draws sharp dividing lines between nations and destabilises the whole region			1
@entity11 , the outgoing secretary - general of the 10 - member @entity12 , told the @entity14 that @entity3 was entering its " most contentious " period in recent years as a rising @entity17 stakes out its claim to almost the entire @entity4 , clashing with the @entity19 , @entity20 and others			1

as it has grown economically and militarily more powerful , @entity30 has become more assertive about its territorial claims in the @entity4 , which encompasses vast oil and gas reserves , large fish stocks and key global trade routes			1
interactive : @entity3 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? after naval clashes with @entity20 and the @entity19 -- which claim parts of the @entity4 alongside @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 -- @entity17 has further angered its neighbours by printing a map of its extensive maritime claim , known as the " nine - dotted line " in new passports			1
@entity20 has hit back by marking the passports of visiting @entity17 as " invalid " and issuing separate visa forms rather than appearing to recognise the @entity17 claim by stamping passports			0
dangerous waters : behind the islands dispute the @entity59 state department on tuesday said @entity60 would continue to accept the new @entity17 passports as legal documents , adding that countries were free to decide what their passports looked like			0
but @entity66 , the state department spokeswoman , added that it was a separate issue " whether it 's politically smart or helpful to be taking steps that antagonise countries "			0
the @entity59 has responded to a resurgent @entity30 by refocusing its foreign policy on @entity3 and building closer strategic and military ties with old foes such as @entity73 and @entity20 , which also fear the consequences of potential @entity17 hegemony in the region			2
squeezed between these two great powers , southeast @entity79 nations will come under growing pressure to take sides unless they can stay united , said mr @entity11 , a @entity83 diplomat who will step down next month after five years as the head of @entity12			0
he argued that the deteriorating situation in the @entity4 was the result of " the internal dynamics of @entity17 " , with @entity30 focused on upholding its sovereignty and territory because of the recent leadership change , growing prosperity and a sense that the state - building process was still under way			2

" @entity99 has to balance itself within an increasingly tense power play , " said mr @entity11			0
" i think @entity99 did what it had to do -- you have to look at it from their perspective			0
" he added that the best hope for avoiding conflict was for @entity12 and @entity17 to agree on a binding code of conduct that would discourage nations from trying to seize islands , oilfields and fishing grounds in order to back up their territorial claims			1
but this would be challenging given that @entity3 's political institutions and dispute - resolution mechanisms were still very under - developed relative to the growing region 's economic might .			2
