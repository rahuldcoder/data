@entity0 -- @entity2 , the newspaper that receives @entity4 military funding to help it cover and get distributed free to @entity4 forces in war zones , complained tuesday of censorship by military authorities in @entity9			1
a soldier with the @entity13 's @entity12 patrols the streets of eastern @entity15 , @entity9 , on june 16			1
in a story on its web site , the newspaper known as @entity19 said the military violated a congressional mandate of editorial independence by rejecting a request to embed reporter @entity24 with the @entity13 's @entity12 , which is attempting to secure the city of @entity15			1
the military cited various problems in @entity24 's reporting on previous embed assignments with units of the division , according to the story			1
one example noted by the military was a march 8 story that said many @entity15 residents would like the @entity4 soldiers to leave and hand over security tasks to @entity9 forces , the @entity19 web site said			2
" despite the opportunity to visit areas of the city where @entity9 @entity13 leaders , soldiers , national police and @entity9 police displayed commitment to partnership , mr. @entity24 refused to highlight any of this news , " maj. @entity41 , a public affairs officer , wrote in denying @entity24 's embed request , according to the @entity19 story			1
a military official in @entity9 defended the move to turn down the reporter 's request			1
" @entity13 units in @entity9 remain committed to the media embed program and appreciate objective media reporting , " said lt. col. @entity58 , a spokesman for @entity59			1
" the relationship that @entity24 established with the command during a previous embed did not facilitate being invited back			2
" @entity58 added that @entity24 was welcome to embed in another unit and that the @entity12 was open to having a reporter other than @entity24			2
" accusations of censorship are without merit , " @entity58 said			2
other allegations against @entity24 by the military included that he used quotes out of context , behaved unprofessionally and persisted in asking @entity13 officials for permission to use a computer to file a story during a communications blackout period , the @entity19 story said			1
@entity81 , editorial director at @entity2 , denied the @entity13 's allegations , calling @entity24 's previous reporting on the division accurate and fair			1
" to simply say ' you ca n't send him because we did n't like what he wrote ' is unacceptable , " @entity81 said			0
he noted that @entity90 set up stripes as an independent newspaper so that " no commander can decide what news troops in the field receive			0
" @entity13 officials have offered to allow a different @entity19 reporter to embed with the division or to allow @entity24 to embed with a different @entity13 unit in @entity100 , @entity81 said			1
stripes rejected those offers because the military has no right to deflect coverage from @entity15 or decide which @entity19 reporter covers its operations , @entity81 said			0
" to deny mr. @entity24 an embed under the reasons stated by @entity112 is a direct challenge to the editorial independence of this newspaper , " @entity81 wrote in his appeal to the decision , according to the @entity19 story			2
" that independence is mandated by @entity90			0
the denial of the embed constitutes an attempt at censorship and it is also an illegal prior restraint under federal law			0
... the military can not tell us what stories to write or not write			0
" @entity19 receives close to $ 10 million a year from the @entity127 to help defray the costs of covering " contingency " operations in @entity9 and @entity130 , including the publishing and distribution of roughly 85,000 free newspapers a day , @entity81 said			0
the newspaper receives additional government subsidies , with the total amounting to less than half of its budget , he said			0
other revenue comes from ad sales and circulation at permanent @entity4 military bases and elsewhere , @entity81 said			0
@entity1 has been denied embed requests on occasion but never because of the past conduct of individual journalists			0
the reasons have almost always involved logistical details involving security and force coverage .			0
