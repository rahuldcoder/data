-- in 2013 , the @entity1 faces a big test			1
members begin the new year in disarray , with their public approval ratings plummeting while @entity6 still control the @entity7 and @entity8			0
the year is coming to a close with an embarrassing display of legislative ineptitude as @entity12 divided over a solution to the fiscal cliff			0
without displaying the capacity for strong leadership , political parties ca n't succeed			1
voters want parties that can get the nation out of trouble , not push them deeper into a hole			2
the @entity1 primaries were filled with aged political actors and oddballs who had trouble convincing @entity1 voters that they could really handle the presidency			1
@entity28 was the @entity1 choice by default			1
he never exhibited the kind of gravitas or inspiration for which voters look			0
in @entity35 , the problem for the @entity1 is even worse			1
in the @entity37 , speaker @entity36 has had almost no success keeping his troops in line			1
he has led a @entity41 that continues to drag down the image of @entity35 and create the impression that @entity1 ca n't handle the responsibilities of power			1
the past two years of his leadership have revolved around the constant collapse of budgetary negotiations			2
@entity7 @entity1 have used the once - routine decision over raising the debt ceiling as a tool of blackmail against the @entity7			1
each time , the speaker has failed to bring republicans to agreement , leaving the negotiations with democrats in disarray			1
the situation became so bad that @entity35 and the @entity7 agreed to impose stringent fiscal action automatically if @entity35 could not take action themselves			0
that 's why we face a fiscal cliff			0
nor has @entity36 displayed the kind of bold courage that would be needed to break with his own party and enter into a bipartisan deal with @entity6			1
this was the kind of action that president @entity72 was willing to take in 1990 , a decision that cost him huge support			0
the result is a political cliff , more than a fiscal cliff , where one of the parties makes legislating impossible			1
in the @entity8 , the leadership has been more effective under minority leader @entity81 , but only as a force of opposition			2
@entity84 has served as a battering ram against the @entity6 majority , using the power of the filibuster to hold up appointments and tie the @entity6 ' agenda into knots			0
but leadership that is good only at saying no rarely inspires -- it 's about preserving gains rather than creating ideas			2
even at the grass roots , conservative leaders allied with the @entity1 have not done well in recent weeks			1
in the wake of the shootings in @entity101 , the @entity102 , a major voice in conservative politics , responded by calling for more guns in the schools , just in the hands of the good guys , rather than on restrictions on the weapons used in this kind of carnage			0
as @entity1 struggle to find common ground with @entity6 over the budget , conservative leaders have generally been unyielding in their resistance to tax increases on most wealthy @entity118 , one that defies @entity118 political history and budgetary realism , to the point of making a deal impossible			1
while the role of movement organizers is always to push their allies toward ideological purity , effective leaders such as @entity124 also understood that elected officials needed the space to enter into deals so that decisions could be made			0
great parties are always able to find great transformative leaders			0
democrats , despite a miserable economy that lasted through @entity136 and being deeply divided along regional lines , found @entity139			0
he brought the factions of his own party together , moving government toward breakthrough deals and guiding the nation toward points of unity			0
in the 1940s and ' 50s , speaker of the house @entity147 did the same , finding the points where @entity151 and @entity152 @entity6 could agree , and even brought some @entity1 along			1
@entity153 moved competing factions into one tent for the @entity1 in the 1980s , as did congressional leaders such as @entity158 sen. @entity157 , who broke through politics to find compromises on issues such as tax hikes			2
today , republicans do n't have those kinds of leaders , and the public is not responding well			0
while there are many names being floated about for future elections , such as @entity171 and @entity172 , the verdict is out as to how they would handle the intense pressures of national office			0
republicans will need to show that their leadership wo n't simply perpetuate the gridlock in @entity179			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2
