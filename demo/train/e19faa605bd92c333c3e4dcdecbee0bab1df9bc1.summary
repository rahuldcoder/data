the government is proposing to bribe communities with cheaper energy bills in exchange for dropping opposition to local fracking projects as part of plans to push ahead with shale - gas extraction			1
several options to cajole rural @entity10 to accept the contentious drilling schemes are being discussed as ministers prepare to announce that the @entity14 's shale - gas reserves are much larger than previously estimated			1
fracking , an extraction technique that involves pumping water , sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale rock to release trapped pockets of oil and gas , has transformed the @entity25 energy market , triggering a production boom that pushed gas prices to 10 - year lows last year			1
environmentalists worry that the process can pollute ground water and cause emissions of methane , a potent greenhouse gas			0
the government 's paper on " community benefits " will propose policies that aim to persuade locals to drop their resistance to fracking in northwest and southeast @entity10 , where the largest shale - gas deposits are found			1
the biggest incentive being discussed by the coalition is cheaper household energy bills for people in the area , according to those familiar with the discussions			0
neighbourhoods could also be offered funding for new sports clubs or community centres and other projects to improve local amenities			0
the @entity56 energy select committee said on friday that communities affected by shale - gas projects " should expect to receive , and share in , some of the benefits of development "			2
it suggested that local authorities hosting shale ventures should also be allowed to retain business rates			0
the system would be similar to the " planning gain " whereby councils that give planning permission to property developments can force the developer to pay for certain infrastructure improvements , such as roads and schools			0
a separate paper will make a similar proposal for new wind farms			0
the government could still face big protests against fracking sites , reminiscent of the widespread grassroots @entity82 hostility to onshore wind turbines and to the @entity86 high - speed railway			2
one conservative mp , @entity87 , has said that planning applications for shale - gas drilling will " make onshore wind farms look like a walk in the park "			2
@entity14 's only fracking operation , by @entity94 near @entity95 , was suspended after two minor earthquakes in 2011			1
it was allowed to resume last december			0
last year , the government commissioned the @entity99 to produce a new estimate of @entity14 's shale - gas reserves , which is understood to show that they are much larger than previously thought .			1
