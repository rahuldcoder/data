seven years after its finale , one of the greatest cult hits in television history is making a return			1
" @entity11 " lasted three season during its initial run on @entity8 , with critical acclaim but dismal ratings			1
since its final episode aired in february 2006 , a little thing called @entity13 ushered in a new way of watching television			1
in doing so , the comedy found a massive following who kicked themselves for missing the dysfunctional antics of the @entity22 before it received the dreaded " canceled " sentencing from prime - time television			0
in a rare move , the @entity26 - winning comedy is making a return , with 15 new episodes with the original cast and crew in tow			1
after a reported bidding war among outlets , @entity13 won the rights to the fourth season everyone hoped for , but no one saw coming			1
after numerous false starts and scheduling conflicts , series creator @entity38 was finally able to work in time for his entire clan to continue the saga of the least redeemable family in @entity44			0
@entity45 recently caught up with the cast to discuss the new episodes , and star @entity48 appeared overjoyed at their family reunion			2
" there really are n't a lot of shows that get to come back together , at least under these circumstances , where it 's not a desperate retread and no one 's really done much since the show went off the air			1
this was a celebratory gathering , a lot of good news , and we knew that we were being included in this effort that @entity13 is making to change the way television is brought to people			1
we 're just fortunate to be a part of that			0
" " @entity11 " is the latest in @entity13 's recent foray into producing original content , and marks a new way for people to enjoy television			1
for those who missed the show during its original run , @entity13 made it possible to watch the entire series in one sitting			1
the increase in popularity for streaming and subscription services has created a culture of television binge - watching			0
many fans of " @entity11 " have never seen the show any other way , and on may 26 , these same fans will have 15 new half - hours for their viewing pleasure			1
@entity92 , aka @entity93 , admits to being a victim of binge - watching herself			2
" i find it really frustrating to have to wait a week to watch a show , and i 'm just so used to seeing things back to back when i want to see them			2
i think what @entity38 has done with ' arrested ' for @entity13 is even more brilliant because he 's used that format and created something brand new within it			1
" with the abundance of reality series taking over both prime - time lineups and @entity107 over the last decade , more and more people have begun turning to cable and premium networks to get their scripted television fix			0
@entity13 is hoping to take a bite out of that population tuning away from the " @entity114 " broadcast networks			2
in fact , these original series are even eligible for @entity117 thanks to a recent rule change allowing broadband programming to be nominated alongside any broadcast , cable or premium network show			1
will the magic that has kept the original 53 episodes as must - see television a decade since the show 's debut still be there ? the cast believe so and if this upcoming season is a success , do n't expect this to be the last you see of @entity134 , @entity135 , and frozen banana stands			1
@entity48 is quick to point out that season 4 is the first arc in a new story			2
" it 's a three - act story that was too big to put in a feature , so we put the first act in these episodes and a movie would be acts two and three			2
" that 's right , the long - rumored film version of the series is still in the works			2
the stars of " @entity11 " may have to keep their characters within arm 's reach in the coming future			1
they said they reveled at the chance to jump back into the shoes of their @entity159 personae , and @entity161 had no trouble slipping into boozy matriarch @entity163			0
" how bad does this make me seem ? it 's not that difficult			2
i hope i 'm not like her ! but when you play something for three seasons like we did , it 's sort of like bike riding : you never forget			0
as soon as i saw the script and saw the people the first day we were all together in that dysfunctional crazy family , it all came back			0
" season 4 features an interesting twist on the show 's successful formula			1
to make the most of the limited time scheduled with the entire cast at once , each episode of the new installment focuses on a different member of the @entity93 family			0
for @entity192 , it was the few scenes the ensemble got to shoot together that made her feel back at home			0
" once i was reunited with my cast on the set of @entity163 's penthouse , that was that moment where it all just kind of clicked , for all of us			0
because it was n't just me and @entity93 and what she was like ; it was how she related to everybody else and her place in the family			0
that was really awesome and that was when it all came rushing back			0
" with the release just a week away , will fans both old and new turn out to get a new slice of afternoon delight ? @entity216 believes everyone will walk away satisfied			0
" it 's going to feel the same as it did			0
i was surprised how similar it looked and felt , and although we are all older , somehow it all worked			0

seven years after its network finale , cult tv show " @entity11 " will return on @entity13
the new season will have 15 episodes that can all be watched beginning may 26
@entity92 says the *reboot* retains the show 's original magic
