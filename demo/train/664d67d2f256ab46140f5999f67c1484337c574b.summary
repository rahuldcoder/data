-- @entity2 manager @entity1 said prior to sunday 's @entity3 that it was his team 's last chance in the @entity7 title race			1
his side came through against @entity9 -- and it was a familiar face who led the way			2
@entity12 netted a hat - trick to become the leading scorer in @entity3 history as part of a 4 - 3 @entity2 victory that featured just about everything in @entity9			1
the estimated worldwide television audience of 400 million for arguably football 's biggest club game could n't have been disappointed			0
" ( @entity12 has ) put in many performances like the one he put in today , but the impact is greater in a @entity3 , " @entity1 was quoted as saying on @entity2 's website			1
" i really have run out of words for him			0
" the first half alone produced four goals but it could have been six or seven			0
the referee was in the spotlight for awarding three penalties , two to @entity2 , and what would an @entity3 be without a red card ? it went to @entity9 's @entity36 midway in the second half with the home team leading 3 - 2 and predictably changed the complexion of the affair			1
out went @entity9 's 31 - game unbeaten streak , a run that began following @entity2 's win in this season 's first league meeting between the giants in october			1
but a part of @entity9 wo n't be disappointed with the result , since @entity51 assumed top spot in @entity53 ahead of its city rival thanks to a better head - to - head record			1
@entity2 trails by a point			0
" @entity53 has started over , we 're back in the fight for the title , " added @entity1			0
the early moments of sunday 's showdown suggested it would be an open contest and so it was n't much of a surprise that it took a mere seven minutes to produce a goal			0
@entity12 's ball released @entity68 , who shot into the top corner			1
@entity70 should have quickly leveled but his effort sailed over the bar and four - time world player of the year @entity12 was guilty of a rare bad miss himself , scuffing his shot when in alone			2
@entity75 outshone his fellow winger @entity76 , his first - half display scintillating			0
@entity12 's fellow @entity78 set up @entity70 's header in the 20th minute for 1 - 1 -- although keeper @entity81 ' reaction suggested he knew he made a mistake			1
with @entity2 reeling , @entity70 's close - range finish in the 24th minute handed @entity9 the advantage and the @entity86 international was only denied a hat - trick when @entity88 cleared off the line			1
@entity12 tied proceedings in the 42nd minute to break @entity92 's @entity3 record , with @entity2 midfielder @entity93 and @entity9 defender @entity94 shown yellow cards in the aftermath when they touched heads -- and then theatrically fell to the ground			1
@entity76 -- the world 's most expensive player who entered the game in his best form of the campaign -- ran at the @entity2 defense to set up @entity70 , who was deprived by @entity81 to begin the second half			2
referee @entity106 awarded @entity9 a penalty when @entity108 clipped @entity109 but contact appeared to be outside the box			0
@entity109 , who like @entity76 was mostly quiet sunday , took the spot kick and the reigning world player of the year converted in the 55th minute			0
@entity12 sent through @entity114 and the @entity115 -- about to be substituted after struggling -- was ruled to have been fouled in the box by @entity36			0
@entity106 again pointed to the spot , @entity36 as the last man received the 19th red card of his career and @entity12 leveled in the 65th to make yet more history			2
he became the second leading scorer in @entity53 on 236 goals			1
with @entity9 forced to sit back and defend , the breakneck pace predictably slowed			0
@entity108 hit the post but when @entity68 went down under a challenge from @entity128 , @entity106 awarded the third penalty			0
@entity130 stepped @entity12 in the 83rd minute			0
he showed no nerves , sending his kick into the roof of the net for a 26th career hat - trick and second in as many games			1
" we had chances and we are not happy , but not to worry , the league is still open , " @entity9 manager @entity137 told reporters			0
@entity51 earlier sunday downed last - place @entity141 2 - 0			1
a dogged @entity141 frustrated @entity51 for the opening 55 minutes but when @entity144 was sent off for a second yellow , the visitor pounced			2
@entity146 -- with a long - range stunner -- and @entity148 scored in the 58th and 64th minutes , respectively , to give @entity51 the win and ultimately first place in @entity7 .			2

@entity12 's hat - trick lifts @entity2 to a 4 - 3 win over 10 - man @entity9
@entity12 becomes the leading scorer in @entity3 history , passing @entity92
@entity2 opened the scoring before @entity9 took 2 - 1 and 3 - 2 leads
@entity51 moves atop the @entity53 standings after a 2 - 0 win over @entity141
