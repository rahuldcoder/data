sometimes a story comes along that is so utterly ridiculous that , as a commentator , your first instinct is to deal with it tongue - in - cheek			0
and so it is with @entity9 's videotaped remarks to a roomful of donors at a fundraiser in may in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the @entity16 presidential candidate appears to say that he wishes he were @entity17 because he thinks it would be " helpful " to his quest and give him a " better shot " at the presidency			2
referring to his father , @entity22 , @entity9 told the audience : " my dad , as you probably know , was the governor of @entity26 and was the head of a car company			2
but he was born in @entity29 ... and had he been born of @entity31 parents , i 'd have a better shot at winning this			0
but he was unfortunately born to @entity34 living in @entity29			0
he lived there for a number of years			0
i mean , i say that jokingly , but it would be helpful to be @entity17			1
" i 'm tempted to respond with this : " @entity9 thinks it would be helpful if he were @entity17			1
well , @entity9 , i 'm @entity17			1
and i think it would be helpful to me if i were worth $ 250 million			0
wan na switch ? " opinion : can @entity9 connect with @entity17 voters ? or , given president @entity45 's heavy - handed immigration policies , with this : " what @entity9 does n't realize is that if he were @entity31 , there 's a 94.6 % chance that he would 've already been deported by his opponent			1
" @entity9 's comments are clearly absurd , and so it 's hard to take them seriously			1
did the rich white guy really claim to want to be @entity17 because he thought it would help him win the presidency ? that 's strange			1
being @entity17 did n't seem to help @entity58			1
the former @entity29 governor ran for president in 2008 , and he did n't get beyond the @entity62 primary			0
also , by @entity9 's logic , you would think that we 've had a whole slew of @entity67 elected president ; there has n't been a single one -- if you do n't count @entity70 playing president - elect @entity71 on the final season of " @entity73			1
" @entity9 should quit while he 's ahead			1
statistically , he has the golden ticket			0
he 's a rich white male , and they 're overrepresented in the exclusive club of the 44 individuals to ever serve as president			0
@entity45 is an exception , and even he satisfies two of three characteristics : rich and male			0
but , if @entity9 really wants to get in touch with his inner @entity31 , i think he 'll find that it 's not all churros and chocolate or pinatas and pan dulce			2
you see -- and you might find this hard to believe , @entity9 -- but there is still a lot of discrimination in this country against @entity67 as whites hunker down and try to hold on to what they have in the face of changing demographics			2
for instance , @entity9 has two @entity100 degrees , and so do i. but i 'll go out on a limb here and guess that he never had anyone suggest that he was only admitted to that prestigious university because of affirmative action			2
or that he is frequently told , as i am , to " go back to @entity29 " -- which is ironic , given that , since i 'm the grandson of a @entity31 immigrant and @entity9 is the son of a @entity31 immigrant , the @entity16 presidential candidate is one generation closer to the motherland than i am			2
yet , as difficult as it is , we must take @entity9 's comments seriously			1
there are three reasons that they 're troubling			0
first , judging from the videotape , when @entity9 suggested that his path to the @entity122 would have been covered in rose petals if only he had been born @entity31 , the crowd loved it			2
what are they thinking ? are these the kind of people who tell themselves that their sons and daughters would have gotten into @entity131 or @entity132 if some black kid had n't taken their spot ? do they really believe that racial and ethnic minorities have it easy in this country ? and if so , what country are they living in ? politics : @entity9 makes case to @entity67 , vows ' reasonable solution ' on immigration second , if you look at the rest of @entity9 's remarks -- about the 47 % of @entity34 who pay no taxes and " who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you - name - it " -- he makes a good point			1
many @entity34 do have an entitlement mentality , and it 's a real problem			0
where @entity9 went wrong is that the sense of entitlement is n't limited to those on government aid			1
it includes the kind of fat cat donors who were in the audience			0
they get tax breaks and corporate subsidies			0
they raise their kids to think they 're entitled to not do the jobs that immigrants wind up doing			0
@entity9 scolded those who think they 're entitled , and then he seemed to wink at the audience and tell them : " present company excluded			2
" lastly , it 's hard to come up with a better example of an @entity34 who sees himself as a victim with a sense of entitlement than @entity9			1
think about what he said			0
by suggesting that he 'd have a better chance at winning this election if he were @entity17 , @entity9 is playing the victim			1
poor me , i had the misfortune to be born a white male			0
it 's clear that he thinks he was entitled to a much smoother path to the @entity122			0
is @entity9 able to fix what 's broken with @entity34 ? or are people like @entity9 what 's broken with @entity34 ? follow @ @entity203 on twitter			1

in remarks *secretly* taped , @entity9 said " jokingly " he 'd have better chance if he were @entity17
@entity209 says @entity9 's taped remarks reveal a *blindness* to his *advantages*
he says @entity9 has n't had to *struggle* to *overcome* the odds that minorities face
@entity217 : he *criticizes* people for feeling entitled but *neglects* his own sense of entitlement
