-- president @entity1 on sunday reiterated his commitment to getting the @entity3 to approve the new start treaty with @entity5 by year 's end , saying he felt " reasonably good about our prospects " for the goal			1
" when we look upon how important @entity5 support has been " on @entity14 sanctions and the @entity16 supply route , @entity1 told reporters aboard @entity11 , " my hope is that because this is a good treaty we should get it done			2
" @entity1 spoke as he was returning from a trip to @entity19 , where he met with @entity5 president @entity20 in @entity21			1
the president said the @entity23 has had a " series of conversations " with @entity27 senators @entity26 of @entity28 , @entity29 , also of @entity28 , and @entity30 of @entity31 about the nuclear arms treaty and that they " say they want to see this done			1
" on saturday , a senior @entity1 administration official said that " negotiations are under way " to spend as much as $ 4 billion more to modernize the @entity39 nuclear arsenal as part of the effort to push through the treaty by year 's end			1
the official 's comments came after a meeting in @entity47 , @entity21 , between @entity1 and @entity20 while attending the @entity48			1
the two leaders discussed a host of issues , from @entity14 to @entity52			0
a swift resolution to the new start treaty issue regulating the two nations ' nuclear arsenals , though , ranked high on their agenda			2
the treaty , signed by @entity1 and @entity20 in april , would cut each country 's deployed nuclear warheads by approximately a third , limiting each side to a maximum of 1,550			1
some @entity27 have held up a vote , saying despite lengthy hearings in the last session , they have more questions about the agreement			2
if no action is taken , new @entity3 hearings would be required and that could set back ratification for as much as two years			0
while they did n't win a majority in the @entity3 , republicans made major gains in november 's election -- meaning they 'll have more clout when the upcoming " lame - duck session " ends and a new @entity78 takes office in january			0
" we have a full - court press under way right now with the key senators , " said the senior administration official			2
" the president has made it very clear ... that this is his highest priority in terms of foreign policy pieces of business to get done in the lame duck session			0
" @entity1 has already included $ 80 billion over 10 years for nuclear weapons modernization in his budget , a move that experts saw as a bid to pre-empt criticism that he is not doing enough to safeguard the @entity39 ' military and nuclear strength			1
but sen. @entity29 , who is leading the charge against voting on the treaty in the lame - duck session , and fellow @entity27 have said they are not convinced the @entity1 administration is committed to modernizing the nations ' nuclear arsenal or to developing and deploying a robust missile defense system			1
for the new start treaty to go into effect , it must be ratified both by the @entity3 and by the lower house of the @entity5 legislature , the @entity109			0
the @entity111 chairman of the @entity112 , @entity110 , said wednesday he 's " very hopeful " the @entity3 will vote in december			0
the uncertainty in @entity114 have held up action in @entity116 as well			0
reacting to the midterm election , the @entity109 's @entity117 delayed consideration by the entire @entity109			0
" they do n't want to be caught in a situation similar to the one they were in with @entity127 , which they ratified but the @entity39 did not , " said @entity120 , director and senior fellow of the @entity122 at the @entity123			2
in their talks saturday , @entity1 discussed with @entity20 his " legislative strategy " to getting the @entity134 treaty ratified , and the two also talked about the political dynamic in @entity5 , the senior administration official said			1
the two leaders also discussed the " next steps " as @entity5 tries to join the @entity137 , a move that will likely happen next year , according to the senior administration official			0
even with @entity134 still in limbo , @entity20 and @entity1 discussed negotiating a new @entity142 in @entity143 , or @entity144 , treaty			1
the pact , which was signed by 30 nations , sets limits for weapons and armament systems from the @entity152 to the @entity153 , the administration official said			0
@entity0 's @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
