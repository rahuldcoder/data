-- @entity1 , authorized by president @entity2 and launched on april 14 , 1986 , entailed the bombing of military and terrorist installations in @entity5 , @entity6			1
the attack was ordered partly in retaliation for @entity6 's role in the bombing of a @entity12 discotheque that claimed the life of two @entity15 servicemen and a @entity17 citizen while injuring more than 200 people , including many @entity15			1
@entity2 also described the @entity15 attack on @entity6 as a " pre-emptive action ... ( designed to ) diminish @entity23 ( @entity22 's ) capacity to export terror			1
" he warned , " if necessary , we shall do it again			0
" criticized by @entity29 allies , the @entity15 maneuver was endorsed by @entity31 prime minister @entity30			1
speaking at the @entity32 on april 15 , she reasoned that " @entity33 of the @entity34 specifically recognizes the right of self - defense			0
in view of @entity6 's promotion of terrorism , the failure of peaceful means to deter it and the evidence that further attacks were threatened , i replied to the ( @entity15 ) president that we would support action directed against specific @entity6 targets			1
... " since her passing monday , @entity30 's role in the unraveling of the @entity50 has been widely assessed			2
indeed , her declaration the year before @entity53 became the @entity55 general secretary presaged the future : " i like mr. @entity53			0
we can do business together			0
" less well recognized , however , is @entity30 's admonition about the gathering threat of international terrorism			1
supporting @entity2 's @entity6 raid was a tough call			1
despite the escalation in state - sponsored terrorism in the 1980s , @entity63 refused over-flight rights for the f - 111 bomber that would undertake the strike against @entity6 , and the leaders of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 refused to assist the @entity15 effort			2
arguments against involvement in the conflict included possible @entity6 reprisals on @entity29 targets , disruption of financial transactions with @entity6 , risks of greater @entity6 - @entity55 collaboration and the encouragement of @entity15 militarism			2
@entity85 , a leader of the @entity88 's shadow government , and dr. @entity89 , leader of the @entity90 and former @entity88 foreign secretary , were among the many @entity31 politicians who denounced @entity30 's stance			1
a @entity94 at the time revealed that about 65 % of the @entity31 public questioned for the survey disapproved of the @entity15 raid			2
even @entity30 's defense of the @entity15 action was not unqualified			2
four days before the attack , @entity2 noted in his diary that she had sent him " a long message pledging support but expressing concern about possible civilian casualties			2
" in his memoir , secretary of state @entity108 recalls that " prime minister @entity30 said yes to our request for use of @entity15 f - 111s from @entity15 bases in @entity31 , but she made it clear that we needed to make public our evidence against ( @entity22 ) , that we should limit the targets to those with clear terrorist connections , and that our retaliation should be ' proportionate			1
' " on december 27 , 1985 , 20 people had been killed , including five @entity15 , when the @entity124 ticket counters were bombed at the @entity126 and @entity127 airports			0
the @entity2 administration considered @entity130 a terrorist organization , and declared that it had undertaken the attacks with support from @entity22			2
the @entity6 leader reportedly called the bombings " heroic			0
" @entity2 responded on january 7 , 1986 , with an executive order that imposed restrictions on trade with @entity6			1
on march 24 , while undertaking peaceful naval exercises in the @entity140 , @entity15 forces were struck by @entity6 surface - to - air missiles			0
the @entity15 returned fire , targeting @entity6 military installations			0
by the time the discotheque was bombed in @entity12 , the pattern of @entity6 - supported terrorism and aggression toward the @entity15 was incontrovertible			1
however , @entity30 alone would stand with @entity2 as he sought to stop @entity22			1
the retaliation against @entity6 did n't stop the terrorist threat			1
on december 21 , 1988 , @entity150 exploded over @entity151 , @entity152			0
the 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground were killed by a bomb attack , which the @entity2 administration blamed on @entity22			0
it was not until april 1999 that the @entity6 government turned over the suspects , who were brought to trial in the @entity163			0
and it was not until 2003 that @entity22 's government took responsibility for the atrocity and agreed to pay compensation to the victims			0
@entity22 claimed , however , that he never ordered the bombing			0
despite @entity6 's ongoing acts of terrorism and the growing global threat from radical @entity175 in the 1980s and 1990s , many @entity29 and @entity15 leaders were loath to contend that @entity22 's actions were anything more than isolated incidents			1
@entity30 's statement on april 15 , 1986 , the day after the @entity15 strike in @entity6 was , prescient : " @entity6 has been behind much of it ( terrorism ) and was planning more			1
" in the current era of @entity15 drone warfare , @entity30 's nuanced support for air attacks on terrorists and their installations is worth reviewing			2
by making the case that the @entity15 had the right to self - defense under @entity33 of the @entity34 , she was positioning @entity29 responses to the emerging war against terrorists in the context of an international legal framework			0
@entity30 repeatedly called for careful targeting in air raids to protect innocent human life , and she was deeply concerned about preventing retaliation from turning into military escalation			2
she was clear - eyed about a threat that many could not see while the @entity50 still raged			0
" terrorism is a scourge of the modern age , " she cautioned			0
those who currently question whether the @entity12 is in a global war against terrorism and who would prefer not to speak of the tragedy of @entity211 would do well to review @entity30 's stance			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity217 : @entity30 gave *crucial* support to *anti-terror* efforts
she says @entity31 prime minister backed @entity2 's retaliation against @entity6
@entity215 : @entity30 was an early , prescient voice on terrorism 's threat to the @entity12
