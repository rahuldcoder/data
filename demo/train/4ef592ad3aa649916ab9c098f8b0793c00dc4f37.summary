-- seven - time world champion @entity1 has told @entity0 that the @entity3 team should have already tied up the @entity6 drivers ' title -- and can only blame themselves for not having done so			1
@entity7 is in pole position to win his third crown , this time for @entity1 's former team @entity10 , at the 2010 season finale in @entity12 this weekend			1
the @entity13 has an eight - point lead from @entity15 , with the @entity17 's @entity3 teammate @entity16 another seven points off the pace			1
the @entity21 outfit has already clinched the constructors ' title , but @entity1 claims the drivers ' battle should not have gone to the final race -- hinting at the widespread reports of tension between @entity16 and @entity15			1
" i guess the main reason why the championship is still open is due to the fact that one particular team has made quite a few errors this year , " he said			0
blog : @entity16 win ushers in new era " and if you think out of 18 races they took 15 pole positions and still only being second and third in the drivers ' championship -- they want to win the championship , yes			0
" but that shows a little bit that something has gone wrong somewhere ... not wanting to go into the details			0
but it 's been exciting , and lots of happenings even from other teams -- so let 's see what the final race will bring to us			0
" the @entity58 race lowdown @entity1 's return to @entity6 may not have been quite as successful as he would have hoped , but the @entity60 believes his past success has helped his younger compatriots			1
the 23 - year - old @entity16 has impressed as the best of a new line of @entity60 talent including @entity67 ' @entity66 and @entity1 's @entity69 teammate @entity68			1
add @entity71 's @entity70 and @entity73 's @entity72 to the mix -- both of whom are still under 30 -- along with @entity78 's comparative veteran @entity77 , and there will be seven @entity60 on the starting grid at @entity81			0
latest f1 championship standings @entity1 , who dominated motorsport 's elite class with @entity10 before retiring in late 2006 , said he deserved some credit for raising @entity6 's popularity in his home country			2
" no doubt i did , yes -- i mean the reason me being successful initiated a lot of manufacturers that we do have in @entity60 , " the 41 - year - old said			0
" i mean we are probably the biggest manufacturers of road cars in @entity60 , in terms of high - end cars , and having @entity6 to be so popular in @entity60 obviously triggered interest of all those manufacturers			2
@entity7 ignores talk of @entity3 team orders " and on this principal they initiated young driver programs where @entity16 is a result out of this one , and i guess i can take some credit from that			1
" @entity1 is ninth in the drivers ' standings , having been unable to add to his record 154 podium finishes this year , while @entity68 is seventh with three third - place finishes			2
he is looking forward to the second year of his contract with @entity69 , which has struggled to build on the success of last year 's world champion @entity115 outfit since taking it over late last year			1
is @entity10 's @entity7 the best on the grid ? " well the future is very clearly to make step by step the development that we really have initiated this year and take the fruits of it by starting [ well ] next year , " @entity1 said			2
" who knows how quick we can recover from our slightly down performance this year ... whether we can immediately go back into the championship fight next year or it needs a little bit more build - up time and lead time until the year after			0
" but i 'm pretty sure next year we 'll be much more competitive and we should be able to win races			0
