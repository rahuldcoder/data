-- sen. @entity1 will win @entity4 's @entity3 presidential primary tuesday , @entity0 projects , although party sanctions have stripped the state of its convention delegates and no @entity3 campaigned there			1
@entity1 addresses a crowd in @entity11 , @entity4 , after winning the state 's primary			1
published polls showed the @entity16 senator and former first lady was heavily favored in the state			2
her leading rivals , @entity21 primary winner sen. @entity20 and sen. @entity22 , did not campaign in @entity4			1
they opted to concentrate on next week 's " @entity29 " contests in states such as @entity16 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity0 's projection is based on precincts reporting results , entrance polls and other statistical models -- including the number of votes outstanding in areas where @entity38 was expected to do well			0
the sanctions make tuesday night 's results largely meaningless to the @entity3 presidential race			0
@entity20 described the primary as a " beauty contest " tuesday , and his campaign issued a statement declaring the race a tie in the delegate count : " zero for @entity20 , zero for @entity38			1
" but @entity38 has pledged to fight to have the state 's delegates seated at the august convention in @entity52 , and has increasingly stressed the state 's importance since losing saturday 's hotly contested primary in @entity21 to @entity20			1
though @entity3 agreed to leave the state off their itineraries in a show of solidarity with the national party , @entity38 attended permitted fund - raisers in @entity4 on sunday and planned to appear with supporters there after polls closed			2
and turnout was high for the race even though no delegates were at stake			2
nearly 400,000 people cast early or absentee ballots ahead of the primary , and tuesday 's vote was expected to top the nearly 800,000 who turned out in 2004			0
@entity74 , who managed former vice president @entity76 's presidential bid , said many @entity3 were likely to turn out to vote on a state constitutional amendment that would limit property tax increases and expand homestead exemptions			0
" people are very afraid this will cut public services , cut back education , " said @entity74 , a @entity0 analyst			0
" so the @entity84 and all of the unions are spending millions of dollars to get voters to turn out			0
