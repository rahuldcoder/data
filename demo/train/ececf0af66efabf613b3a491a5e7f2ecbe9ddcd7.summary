-- let 's face it : @entity3 has not exactly been the second coming of @entity5			1
he swept into office vowing to step up the war effort in @entity8 and @entity9 , and he did , sending 30,000 fresh troops into the former and vastly expanding drone strikes in the latter			1
@entity3 managed to get @entity13 , an achievement will likely be hearing about ad nauseum on the campaign trail over the long months ahead			1
but he has n't realized the much more difficult goal of bringing stability to @entity8 , a land we have now been trying to stabilize for more than a decade			1
the recent spectacular attacks in @entity21 , in which insurgents were able to once again paralyze the capital for 24 hours , may not have been @entity24 , but they did underscore just how the fragile the planned 2014 handover to @entity8 control really is			2
enter @entity27 , whose positions on @entity8 have been all over the map			1
he 's criticized the @entity3 administration for setting a timeline for withdrawal , but he has endorsed the timeline in practice			2
he 's denounced the idea of negotiating with the @entity37 but has n't explained how he plans to defeat the insurgent movement on the battlefield			0
his main substantive complaint seems to be that @entity3 is withdrawing the surge troops by september instead of ... december			2
indeed , his campaign 's few pronouncements on this subject are reminiscent of @entity46 's " secret plan " to end the war in @entity48 , which turned out to be a plan to cut and run without ever admitting as much			0
the truth is that @entity27 holds more or less the same position on @entity8 as the president -- steadily turning control over to the @entity8 in the run - up to 2014 , while cajoling the @entity9 to be more cooperative -- but he just ca n't admit it			1
politically speaking , this is a smart strategy			0
poll after poll has shown that @entity58 simply are n't interested in spending billions of their dwindling tax dollars to prop up @entity60 , a deeply unimpressive leader who appears to them as ungrateful as he is incompetent and untrustworthy			1
that is , to the extent that @entity58 still think about this long - forgotten war at all			2
one way or another , we 're leaving @entity8 , and i suspect we 'll someday look back on the conflict and wonder just what we were doing there for so long -- why , for instance , we thought it made sense to spend more money there each year than the country 's entire gdp ( excluding opium production , that is ) , and why we thought an impoverished , land - locked strategic backwater was such an important chess piece in a new " @entity81			1
" as long as @entity9 sees its interests as diametrically opposed to ours , and shelters and colludes with our enemies , this war could grind on forever			0
as long as @entity8 is led by venal and weak - kneed partners , counterinsurgency is a waste of time			2
and nothing in the past decade suggests any of that will change on any time scale the @entity58 people will accept			2
none of this is to say that leaving @entity8 -- especially women -- to their fates after all we 've promised them is a comfortable moral decision to make			0
i do n't envy the @entity58 officials having to explain that all the talk about saving @entity8 women was just political rhetoric from a country that , at the end of the day , makes its national security decisions based on hard - nosed interests , not sentiment			1
but those conversations would happen under a @entity27 presidency just as they would under a second @entity3 term			1
we 've gotten our revenge for 9/11			0
@entity13 is at the bottom of the @entity113 , and the core of his @entity116 network is much diminished			0
@entity60 's government has been given an ample chance to succeed or fail on its own			0
as for @entity121 , let 's not forget -- @entity8 was where the greatest general in history met his match			0
history may not be repeating itself today , but it sure does rhyme			0
join us at @entity130 / @entity129 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			0

@entity133 : @entity3 got @entity13 but has n't brought stability to @entity8
enter @entity27 , he says , who denounces @entity3 but whose positions are all over the place
he says @entity27 would do about same as @entity3 ; @entity8 is an *intractable* conflict
@entity133 : @entity58 will leave @entity8 under @entity27 or @entity3 ; not easy , but necessary
