-- chemical testing of air samples from the trunk of @entity8 's car primarily showed the presence of gasoline , jurors in @entity3 's capital murder trial heard wednesday			1
other compounds , including chloroform , were also found , but the amount did not appear to be large , @entity12 chemist @entity11 told jurors in the @entity17 courtroom			1
testing was not done to determine the amounts , @entity11 said , but " they gave very low responses in the instrument			2
" while some of the compounds found are associated with human decomposition , @entity11 told defense attorney @entity25 , he can not definitively say that their presence indicated a decomposing body was in the trunk , because there are other natural sources for those compounds as well			1
@entity11 took the air samples from the trunk , one of which was sent to @entity35 at @entity37 's @entity36			1
earlier in the trial , @entity35 testified that testing on a carpet sample from the trunk showed chloroform at a level that was " shockingly high			1
" he also testified the odor in the air samples he received was " extremely overwhelming			0
" he identified it as human decomposition			0
@entity8 , 25 , is charged with seven counts in her daughter 's death , including first - degree murder			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
prosecutors allege @entity3 used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious , then used duct tape to cover her nose and mouth , suffocating her			2
@entity8 's remains , prosecutors allege , were then put into @entity3 's car trunk and eventually disposed of			1
the girl 's skeletal remains were found in a wooded field on december 11 , 2008 , nearly six months after her family last reported having seen the child			1
defense attorneys say @entity8 was not murdered , but that she accidentally drowned in the family pool on june 16 , 2008 , the day she was last reported to have been seen			1
they argue that @entity3 and her father , @entity3 , panicked and covered up the death			0
@entity3 has rejected that scenario in his testimony			0
@entity8 was not reported missing to police until july 15 , 2008 , when @entity8 's mother , @entity74 , tracked down her daughter and demanded answers regarding @entity8 's whereabouts			1
@entity11 was one of a handful of forensic experts testifying wednesday as @entity3 's defense continued presenting its case			1
jurors also heard from @entity83 geologist forensic examiner @entity82 , who analyzed a number of items in the case for soil samples , including 22 pairs of shoes from the @entity3 home			0
only three pairs had some material for comparison , she told defense attorney @entity94 , and soil on them did not match that at the site where @entity8 's remains were recovered			1
however , she acknowledged on cross-examination that does not mean she can say for sure the shoes were never there , as soil can fall off or material from several locations can cloud testing results			2
also , @entity83 forensic toxicologist @entity107 told jurors she tested the " hair mass " found with the child 's remains for the presence of 11 drugs , including @entity114 , @entity115 and ketamine			1
the results were all negative , she said			2
the @entity83 lab does not test hair for the presence of chloroform , she said			2
@entity83 forensic chemist @entity122 was recalled to the stand , where he testified that testing showed no chloroform was found on @entity8 's car seat , in the interior of @entity3 's car or the steering wheel cover in the car			1
testing on a liquid found in a syringe , discovered inside a plastic bottle near @entity8 's remains , showed testosterone compounds but no significant amount of chloroform , he said			1
@entity83 trace evidence examiner @entity137 , also recalled to the stand , said that of " hundreds " of hairs she examined in the case , from the @entity3 home , @entity3 's vehicle and @entity3 's clothing , she only found one that showed evidence of decomposition			1
but , she told prosecutor @entity149 , that one came from @entity3 's trunk -- the subject of her previous testimony			2
under questioning from @entity149 , @entity154 said that sometimes drugs do not show up in hair and that a person still could have been given drugs with negative hair testing results			1
on tuesday , prosecutors told @entity162 chief judge @entity161 they are looking into information regarding a woman who at one point was incarcerated with @entity3 , and whose child died in a way similar to how @entity3 's defense says @entity8 died			1
the matter was mentioned in a conversation regarding discovery items provided to the defense			2
april @entity175 's child died in a pool , and the child 's grandfather discovered the body , prosecutor @entity173 told @entity161			1
@entity175 says she never spoke with @entity3 , but did not know whether @entity3 may have talked to other inmates , @entity173 said			0
" it 's being explored whether there was indirect contact , " she said			2
the information came from someone who called the @entity186 last week , suggesting the two could have been in contact , @entity173 said			0
in response to a question from @entity161 , @entity173 said she does not currently plan for @entity175 to testify , but the information could become relevant			0
@entity175 told @entity0 's sister network @entity191 she never met @entity3 during the few days she was in jail for driving with a suspended license and that she has nothing to do with the case			2
according to the @entity198 newspaper , @entity175 's 15 - month - old son , @entity196 , drowned in a backyard pool on christmas day 2007			1
after finding him in the pool , the boy 's grandfather performed cpr and called 911 , @entity173 said in court tuesday			2
@entity205 , a spokesman for the @entity186 , said @entity175 was in the same dormitory as @entity3 for five days , from june 4 through june 8 , 2009			0
there are no jail records , investigations or reports that indicate any contact occurred between the two , he said			0
a @entity214 forensic scientist testified tuesday that given even a small amount of @entity217 , it would be possible to extract a dna profile from the duct tape covering the mouth portion of @entity8 's skeletal remains			1
but dna expert @entity222 testified that he did not ask to test the duct tape , although he said he offered to investigate			0
@entity222 testified about " low copy number " dna , a technique by which small samples of dna are amplified and copied in an effort to obtain a full profile			0
he said that when tape is used to cover a person 's mouth , it is possible the sticky side of the tape could contain skin cells from the face as well as dna from the mouth			2
however , he told @entity149 , factors such as heat and water have " a very detrimental effect " on dna and it would be difficult to determine a profile from tape that , as in this case , had been exposed to the elements for as long as six months			0
an @entity83 examiner previously testified that dna testing on the tape was inconclusive , but a possible indication of dna there did not appear to match that of @entity8 , @entity8 or @entity3			1
also tuesday , @entity254 , an analytical chemist from the @entity36 , testified that , while testing on carpet from @entity3 's car trunk showed the presence of chloroform , a test to determine how much chloroform was present would have been meaningless , as chloroform is a " volatile chemical " that evaporates , much like gasoline , asked what effect a closed trunk would have on that , @entity254 said it would not slow the chemical 's volatility but might make it more difficult for the chemical to escape the trunk			1
@entity254 told @entity149 on tuesday that the " relative abundance " of chloroform was " very unusual to me			0
" earlier tuesday , a forensic botanist testified @entity8 's remains could have been at the site where they were found -- less than a mile from her grandparents ' home -- for as little as two weeks , based on plant evidence found there			1
" i do n't know exactly when " the remains were placed there , @entity280 said			2
" my best guess is what i have presented today			0
" @entity149 introduced into evidence a photo of @entity8 's skull , showing leaf matter and debris that had accumulated up to the lower portion of the eye sockets			1
he asked @entity280 if that could have occurred in two weeks			0
" if these leaves are , in fact , the level that has fallen since the skull has been there , then clearly the skull has been there for a lot longer than two weeks , would n't you agree ? " @entity149 asked			2
" given your hypothesis that it had lain there undisturbed all that time , the answer would be yes , " @entity280 acknowledged			0
she told @entity149 she could not say for sure if it was possible the skull could have sunk into the leaf litter			0
as the photo of the skull was shown in the courtroom , @entity3 looked downward with her mouth pressed to the back of her hand			0
@entity280 also told jurors tuesday that fragments found on and in @entity3 's car did not match the vegetation at the scene where the remains were found			1
the trial entered its fifth week monday			0
@entity161 told jurors that the trial will go only until about noon wednesday , adding that he has a meeting at 1 p.m. concerning state trial court budgeting			0
he said the court day on saturday will be extended to make up the time			0
in @entity328 's @entity327 , @entity324 and @entity325 and @entity191 's @entity326 contributed to this report			0
