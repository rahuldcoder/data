@entity1 's space plans are ambitious , incremental and extensive			1
should @entity2 be worried that @entity1 will overtake us in both space exploration and military capability in space ? no , not yet			1
this week , @entity1 successfully achieved its first manned space docking with the launch of the @entity10 9 spacecraft that carried two men and @entity1 's first female astronaut			1
part one of @entity1 's @entity14 , a 30 - year plan for space exploration that was approved in 1992 , is complete			1
this is progress , indeed			0
@entity14 is the result of @entity1 's fear of being left behind in the development of space technology			2
part one was about attaining human spaceflight			0
part two -- which is where @entity1 is now -- focuses on testing advanced technologies , like maneuvering and docking			2
part three envisions a large ( about 20 tons , the size of @entity31 ) space station			0
@entity1 sends first female astronaut to space a manned mission to the moon was never included in the plan and has only recently become a topic of discussion in @entity1			1
when talks do come up of putting a @entity1 on the moon as early as 2016 , they can rile @entity2 officials and engender international prestige for @entity1 , especially as the @entity2 space program appears to be floundering			1
but @entity1 is not overtaking the @entity2 in space			1
it is , however , advancing			0
the execution of @entity1 's space program has led to " tortoise and hare " comparisons with the @entity2			1
during the @entity54 phase , the @entity2 advanced very quickly , launching many missions which culminated in reaching the moon by a decade 's end			2
in contrast , @entity1 launches a mission about every two years , but takes large steps with each one and has a much longer timeline for achieving its goals			2
what @entity1 has that the @entity2 lacks -- and what may give the @entity1 an advantage over the long run -- is patience			1
@entity1 's path to space is not without obstacles , though			2
launching their large space station will require a new heavy lift vehicle , the long march 5 , which is still in development and behind schedule			0
and @entity1 's ambitions do not come with an unlimited budget , even though it has already spent billions			2
in response , the @entity2 needs to keep moving forward			0
the @entity83 administration 's decision to redirect the civilian space program to a private - public partnership is smart			0
a space exploration program fully funded by the government is unsustainable			1
the recent use of the privately developed @entity90 duo to resupply the @entity91 indicates that if the private sector can handle low - @entity95 orbit needs , then over time @entity92 can focus its limited budget on new , more distant exploration goals			0
but @entity2 are not known for patience			2
the real danger for the @entity2 is in ceding space exploration and leadership to @entity1 because it lacks the political will to proceed at a steady , supportable pace			1
this will have broad strategic implications			0
complicating the issue is the largely dual - use nature of space technology , which can be used for both civilian and military purposes			0
and it is difficult to discern whether military space assets are intended for offense or defense			0
the difference between a rocket and a missile is considerable in political considerations , but nominal in terms of technology			0
a country that possesses missile defense could also use it as a weapon			0
so what can be done if we need to protect our space assets ? one thing is clear -- weapons are not the answer			0
@entity1 's irresponsible 2007 anti-satellite weapon test exponentially increased the amount of space debris in orbit , which is dangerous to operating satellites			2
space debris is now recognized by all countries ( and militaries ) as a threat to space assets			0
an @entity140 is being discussed in the @entity141			0
it would state what responsible spacefaring nations consider acceptable behaviors in space			0
though legally nonbinding , it would be a first step toward maintaining the sustainability of the space environment for use by all			0
the @entity2 largely knows what space technology @entity1 possesses , but it does n't know what @entity1 's intentions are			1
the @entity2 should try to better understand @entity1 's space goals			1
however , @entity92 is prohibited by law from working with @entity1			0
if one believes that @entity1 and the @entity2 are not inherently enemies , then working together on space projects -- with technology transfer controls -- will benefit both countries			1
if one believes that @entity1 is inherently a threat to the @entity2 , then the adage " keep your friends close and your enemies closer " comes to mind			1
the script for @entity2 - @entity1 relations -- and space relations in particular -- is constantly evolving			1
the @entity2 can influence the direction , but only if we engage and persuade the @entity1 to engage with us			1
it 's one way of preventing a scenario of a galactic @entity178 in which @entity1 has become the world 's leader in space			2
historic @entity1 space mission docks successfully follow @entity184 's space and science blog @entity185			1

@entity1 successfully achieved its first manned space docking this week
@entity190 : @entity2 should not worry just yet about @entity1 overtaking it in space
she says real danger is if @entity2 cedes space exploration to @entity1 because it lacks patience
@entity198 : it would benefit both @entity2 and @entity1 to work together on space projects
