" the army and the judiciary , they both have to protect democracy in @entity1 , " @entity15 said in a speech monday night , after the vote			1
" they ca n't remove democracy			2
they ca n't pack up the system			0
" the resolution calls for support for the democratic system in general -- something a majority of lawmakers are unlikely to vote against -- without naming any political parties or individuals , suggesting that it was designed to bolster the government while avoiding the risk of hurting the prime minister or the @entity32			1
" this house endorses and supports the efforts made by the political leadership for strengthening democracy and reposes full confidence and trust in them , " part of the resolution reads			1

military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes			0
the military and the government have been locked in an uneasy standoff after allegations of a secret effort by the government last year to ward off a possible military coup by curbing the army 's power with @entity148 's help			2
that compounded tensions created by the @entity151 killing of @entity153 leader @entity152 on @entity1 soil in may , which deeply embarrassed the military , and @entity157 airstrikes in november that killed two dozen @entity1 soldier near the @entity160 border , putting further pressure on relations with @entity148			1
a @entity14 panel also held a hearing monday to investigate an unsigned memo sent to the @entity166 that allegedly called for @entity148 to help avert a military coup and curb the military 's powers			2
the memo enraged military leaders who are cooperating with the @entity14			2
