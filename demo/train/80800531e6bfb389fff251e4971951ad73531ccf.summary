-- two more churches in @entity2 were firebombed sunday , bringing the total to six since a court ruled that non-muslims can use the word " @entity7 " as a term for @entity9			1
no one has been hurt in the attacks , which began friday			2
they follow a high court 's ruling that @entity15 can use the word " @entity7 " in literature printed in the country 's official language , @entity19			1
in @entity19 , the word for @entity9 is " @entity7 , " as it is in @entity21			1
but many in the predominantly @entity24 country , including the government , believe the word should be exclusive to @entity24			2
the government has banned the use of the word in @entity30 literature , saying it is likely to confuse @entity32 and draw them to @entity30			1
it has also appealed the high court 's ruling			2
the bombings may be an attempt to intimidate judges to overturn the decision , said the rev. @entity39 , general secretary of the @entity40 in @entity2			1
political leaders from a range of parties deplored the attacks on the churches			0
prime minister @entity46 visited one of the targeted churches on saturday and called for calm			0
emphasizing his resolve to maintain ethnic and racial harmony in society , @entity46 also said the @entity24 faith prohibits insulting other religions or destroying their sanctuaries			0
in recent months , authorities in @entity2 have seized more than 20,000 bibles because they refer to @entity9 as @entity7			1
the seizures have fed fears among minority groups , which see signs of encroaching @entity24 fundamentalism in the predominantly @entity24 but multiracial country			0
a @entity65 weekly newspaper , @entity64 , challenged the ban in court after the government threatened to revoke the newspaper 's license for using the word in its @entity19 edition			1
hearings on the case went on for two years before the high court 's ruling last week			2
@entity2 has some of the tightest government restrictions on religion in the world , according to a study published last month by the @entity81			1
the country was among the 10 most restrictive countries out of 175 in the survey			0
but it had relatively low levels of social tension between religious groups , the report found			0
