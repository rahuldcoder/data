@entity0 -- @entity3 's highest court declared the parliament invalid thursday , and the country 's interim military rulers promptly declared full legislative authority , triggering fresh chaos and confusion about the country 's leadership			1
the @entity12 found that all articles making up the law that regulated parliamentary elections are invalid , said @entity16 , a constitutional lawyer			0
the ruling means that parliament must be dissolved , state tv reported			2
@entity20 has been in session for just over four months			0
it is dominated by @entity23 , a group long viewed with suspicion by the military			0
the @entity30 , in control of the country since @entity29 's ouster , said that it now has full legislative power and that by friday it will announce a 100 - person assembly that will write the country 's new constitution			1
the real obstacle to democracy in @entity3 the @entity37 , @entity3 's largest @entity23 party , said @entity30 leaders were taking matters into their own hands " against any true democracy they spoke of			1
" the court also ruled that former prime minister @entity44 , the last prime minister to serve under ousted president @entity29 , may run in a presidential election runoff this weekend			1
the court rejected a law barring former members of @entity29 's regime from running in the election			2
the runoff saturday and sunday pits @entity44 against @entity52 , head of the @entity53 , which is the @entity37 's political arm			1
@entity44 , at a news conference in @entity0 , praised the high court for rejecting the rule preventing former regime members from running			1
" the age of settling accounts is over and gone			0
the age of using the law and the country 's institutions against any individual is over , " he said			0
@entity66 , a spokesman for the @entity37 , said a court ruling to ban @entity68 was unnecessary			1
what is the @entity37 ? " we will put all our efforts into the upcoming elections so that @entity52 wins and we avoid the rebirth of the old regime overnight , " he said			1
yet some @entity53 members , including parliamentarian @entity76 , called the rulings " a complete coup d'etat through which the military council is writing off the most noble stage in the nation 's history			0
" @entity84 , an @entity3 - @entity85 journalist and author of the book " @entity88 , " predicted that the @entity37 , which has " shied away " from " straight - up confrontation " with the military leadership , wo n't " go to war over this			1
" " the activist community , on the other hand , they are very upset , " he said			0
@entity95 of the @entity95 decried the court 's decisions in a tweet			2
" @entity3 just witnessed the smoothest military coup , " said @entity101 " we 'd be outraged if we were n't so exhausted			0
" perhaps guarding against more popular unrest , riot police and military personnel , some in armored vehicles , were outside the court ahead of the rulings			2
military intelligence officers were also present			0
after the ruling about @entity44 was announced , a crowd of citizens shouted their disapproval			1
military police moved to block the road in front of the court -- a major @entity0 artery			2
@entity119 , director of research at the independent @entity121 , called the court rulings the " worst possible outcome " for @entity3 and declared that he felt the transition to civilian rule is " effectively over			1
" " @entity3 is entering into a very dangerous stage and i think a lot of people were caught by surprise , " he said			0
@entity85 secretary of state @entity130 said thursday that , even with the rulings , " we expect a full transfer of power to a democratically elected civil government			1
there can be no going back on the democratic transition called for by the @entity3 people			1
" some activists and analysts , like @entity84 , described the court 's decisions as politically motivated			2
but @entity142 -- a former foreign minister under @entity29 , @entity144 chief and most recently presidential candidate -- offered an opposite view , saying everyone knew that a decision was coming thursday			1
" it is not a political move , " he said			1
" it is a legal matter that has been referred to a tribune by individuals			0
" calling the previously instituted constitutional panel " unsatisfactory for many parties " because of the influence in it held by the @entity37 , @entity142 said he understood the military 's commitment to address the matter in the coming days			2
he also said that whomever is elected president will be key in moving the country forward , downplaying the fact a finalized constitution may not be in place by the time @entity52 or @entity44 take office			1
" the president will be responsible for so many things , we 'll have to see the actions that the president makes , " said @entity142 , calling an earlier " constitutional declaration " on the president 's powers sufficient			2
for @entity3 's trapped and teeming , revolution has barely begun many voters were unhappy with both choices in the runoff			2
@entity52 and @entity44 are the most nonrevolutionary of all candidates and represent " two typically tyrannical institutions : the first ( @entity52 ) being a member of the @entity37 , and the second ( @entity44 ) a senior official of the former regime , " @entity181 wrote for @entity188 earlier			1
" everything about @entity3 's revolution has been unexpected , and the first - round results in the country 's first - ever competitive presidential elections are no different , " @entity189 , director of @entity191 studies at the @entity192 and visiting scholar at the @entity121 , wrote for @entity194 previously			0
@entity3 's voters " overwhelmingly chose the revolution over the old regime ... but their failure to unite on a single platform directly benefited @entity44 , " @entity189 said			2
thursday 's rulings come a day after @entity3 's military - led government imposed a de facto martial law , extending the arrest powers of security forces			0
@entity3 's @entity211 issued a decree wednesday granting military officers the authority to arrest civilians , state - run @entity210 reported			0
the mandate remains in effect until a new constitution is introduced , and could mean those detained could remain in jail for that long , Ã‚ the agency said			0
lawyers for the @entity37 filed a court appeal against the decree on thursday , the same day @entity232 " expressed concern " about measures she said appeared " to expand the power of the military to detain civilians and to roll back civil liberties			1
" a decades - old emergency law that critics said gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charges expired on may 31			0
the political scene in @entity3 remains tense after the parliament failed to agree on a committee to write a new constitution defining the powers of the president and the parliament			0
