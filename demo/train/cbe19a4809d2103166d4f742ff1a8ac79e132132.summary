@entity0 -- the most important tool that law enforcement officers have at their disposal is common sense			1
this is especially true with that segment of the force that spends the most time interacting with the public : traffic cops and highway patrol officers who enforce the vehicle code			2
i 'm glad the @entity0 police officer who pulled me over a couple of years ago had common sense			1
he had spotted me holding onto my smartphone and suspected that i was violating @entity21 's " hands free " law			1
the law , which took effect in 2008 , prohibits drivers from talking on a cell phone while driving			1
by the time the officer approached the driver 's side window , he had his ticket book out			2
after we exchanged pleasantries , he told me that he had pulled me over for talking on the phone while driving			1
that 's true , i said			0
i was talking on the phone			2
then , i turned my head , so he could see the @entity38 headset lodged in my right ear			0
i was using a hands - free device , just as the law requires			2
but , i explained , i had to lay my hands on the phone , if only for a second , to push the button that makes a call			2
" that makes sense , " the officer said with a smile as he closed his ticket book			2
" have a nice day			0
" there is no argument that distracted driving can be just as dangerous as drunken driving , and so states have the right to pass laws that ban the practice of talking on the phone while driving			1
twelve states and the @entity62 have such laws on the books			0
forty - two states and the @entity62 also ban texting while driving			1
however , these laws raise questions			0
for instance , if the idea is to stop drivers from being distracted , then why stop at banning handheld cell phones ? we can hold the steering wheel with one hand while using the other to drink a cup of coffee or eat a hamburger , but we ca n't use it to hold a phone ? we can fiddle with the radio or -- in a minivan , the dvd player -- but we ca n't access @entity82 or satellite radio on our phone ? besides , as illustrated by a recent appeals court decision in @entity21 that could reverberate around the country , passing a law is the easy part			1
it is implementing it on the street that can get tricky for police -- especially in the age of the smartphone that does n't just let you make a call but also provides a variety of functions that , far from being harmful to motorists , might prove helpful			1
for instance , you can access a map with your phone			1
that 's what @entity104 of @entity105 , @entity21 , was trying to do a few years ago when an officer with the @entity108 pulled him over			1
@entity104 says that he was stuck in heavy traffic because of road construction , and that he was using the map function on his phone to look for an alternate route			1
@entity104 tried to explain to the officer that he was n't talking on the phone , and so -- given his understanding of the state 's hands - free law -- he had not committed any infraction			1
the officer did n't buy it and proceeded to write him a $ 165 ticket			0
@entity104 thought that was unfair , and so he fought the ticket in court -- all the way , in fact , to the 5th @entity127 , which recently ruled in his favor			2
the appeals court threw out the ticket , declaring that the @entity131 had only intended to prevent talking on the phone while driving			1
" @entity104 contends he did not violate the statute because he was not talking on the telephone			0
we agree , " the court wrote			0
" we conclude the statute means what it says -- it prohibits a driver only from holding a wireless telephone while conversing on it			0
" this may be that we have not heard the last of this case			0
the state could appeal , and the @entity21 @entity146 could agree to hear the case			1
the legislature could decide to amend the law to broaden it out and perhaps close some of the loopholes			0
for now though , this is a major victory -- not just for one @entity21 motorist but for common sense			1
the officer who stopped @entity104 that day on the roadway was short on it			0
he could have saved us all time and trouble by not forcing the issue and making room for the possibility that there was nuance in how the law should be applied			0
yet , the good news is that the appeals court had enough to keep law enforcement from overreaching			0
the framers of the @entity170 could never have imagined automobiles or cell phones			0
yet , because of how they felt about the courts reining in the power of the state , you can bet that they would be pleased at how this story turned out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity21 court sided with a driver who looked at a map on phone while in his car
@entity182 : the dangers of texting and driving are well - known
he says cops should use common sense , not ban all use of phones in cars
@entity182 : smartphones provide a variety of tools that could be helpful
