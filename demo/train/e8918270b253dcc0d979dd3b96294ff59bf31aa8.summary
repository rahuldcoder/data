-- as 2010 draws to a close , we who report on the ever - evolving digital space have been given the perfect backdrop for looking back at the year that was and the year ahead			1
in a year full of gray -- think of the debate over whether @entity9 and @entity10 are forces for good or evil -- two high - profile attempts to make things black and white bubbled to the surface in the past few weeks : the federal government 's rules on access to internet service and its proposed " do not track " registry for online advertising			1
both represent a significant shift in thinking about the internet , even if the results for the average @entity25 are n't immediately obvious			0
for starters , an internet version of the " do not call list " for telemarketers would seem to destroy the holy grail that online publishers and advertisers have sought since the early days of the @entity33 : advertising directly targeted to individual consumers ' behavior			0
although marketers have long used cookies to track your web surfing , recent innovations have given them a whole new level of precision			0
@entity9 's " like " button -- derided this year as a major privacy infraction because it exposes you and your preferences not just to friends but to advertisers -- has been installed on more than 2 million web sites , with tens of thousands more adding it daily			1
geolocation services like @entity52 , in their infancy a year ago , now track the whereabouts of millions of users			1
with smartphones growing ubiquitous and location - aware applications of all kinds becoming commonplace , advertising that knows both where you are and what you like is very much a reality			0
most advertisers and publishers do allow users to opt out of such targeting , but the @entity66 believes that simpler , more transparent options are needed			0
the devil is in the details here : opt - outs on obscure web pages or hidden browser menus wo n't help consumers much , but in - your - face requirements that encourage more users to take their privacy more seriously may pose a huge problem to some of the @entity33 's most promising companies			0
information and how it travels are also central to " net neutrality , " the buzzword for unrestricted access to internet services and content			1
rules passed this month by the @entity89 probably wo n't much alter the way you use the internet , but they pose interesting questions			2
for starters , as an internet regulator , would the @entity89 have the authority -- through its new relationship with internet service providers -- to block a site like @entity10 , which posts information potentially harmful to government interests ? thus far , we 've seen the private sector self - regulate by cutting off services to @entity10 , but the new @entity89 - @entity106 dynamic could create intriguing ( frightening ? ) scenarios down the road as @entity10 intensifies its document dumps , which seems likely			1
other internet issues that seized our attention in 2010 are at least tangentially related to this debate			1
a largely unregulated internet has created knowledge and wealth , but it 's also long provided a medium for predatory , abusive and bullying behavior			2
concern over this came to a head this year , with social networking services taking heat for their role in cyberbullying			0
perhaps the most prominent example of internet harassment came in september , when @entity130 student @entity128 committed suicide after a video stream set up without his knowledge showed his sexual encounter with a man in his dorm room			0
although prosecution of cyberbullies falls out of the @entity89 's jurisdiction , provisions in the net neutrality rules , such as the ability for businesses that provide internet access ( like coffee shops and bookstores ) to block content as they see fit , have the potential to cut off a readily available source of the anonymity that bullying thrives on			1
of course , blocking access to the likes of @entity9 and @entity156 has negative repercussions too , especially as more consumers turn to these services both for communication and to share news and information			2
but like much of what went on in 2010 , that 's still a gray area , too			2
the reality of the year ahead probably falls somewhere between doomsday scenarios and an internet that continues to evolve for both consumers and big business			1
information is coming of age , and the stage has now been set for some interesting all - but - inevitable conflicts that will probably be right there on the surface when we take a look again , roughly 365 days from now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

@entity181 says 2010 brought gray areas such as @entity10 and privacy issues
he says new rules on internet access and proposed " do not track " registry loom
these raise issues for new year of who gains , cedes control on the internet , he says
@entity181 : consumer , business control , privacy , bullying are key in evolving information age
