-- when i was eight , my mother enrolled me in ballet classes			1
every saturday we would trek across town to the building that housed the big bright room with the large mirrors			2
we would sit in the waiting room with the other girls my age , all of us in our pink leotards and soft pink satin shoes , with our moms at our side			2
once inside , we would be taught the most delicate of moves from first position to fourth			2
they were gentle and fun but i was impatient			0
i wanted to stand on my toes			0
i wanted to do the pointes and twirl			0
that was n't to be			0
after a mere three weeks , just three lessons , i told my mother i no longer wanted to continue			0
i told her it just was n't for me			0
what i did n't tell her was that they were n't teaching us what i thought ballet was all about : dancing on your toes			1
at eight , i naively thought i could do it ! my mother did n't force me but as i think back to that time , i wish she had			0
in some countries , ballet and the arts are part of the cultural dna			1
in @entity39 , there is a great respect for the heritage and pride in what they do so well			1
the @entity45 is considered the preeminent ballet company in the world and across @entity39 similar companies are religious about their art. in december , i was in @entity50 where we hosted icon 's ballet edition			1
seeing the inner workings of a ballet company and being backstage was such an eye - opening experience			1
we were fortunate enough to be in on a rehearsal as @entity59 , the @entity60 's new artistic director was choreographing his first dance with his three principal dancers			1
this was no ordinary rehearsal , and @entity59 's appointment is no ordinary promotion			1
the @entity68 is the first foreigner to lead a major dance company in @entity39 since @entity71 @entity70 over a century ago			1
there are politics even in this seemingly serene artistic world			1
national companies compete to get the best dancers and directors and there is pressure to deliver a style of ballet that will bring audiences to theaters			2
there is also great debate over the merits of contemporary ballet versus the classics			1
conventional wisdom says that the audience wants to see what they know : " @entity95 , " " @entity96 , " " @entity97 " are just a few examples of what usually sells			0
but there are artistic directors out there who feel the art of ballet is almost a living , breathing thing -- something that needs to evolve			1
@entity59 , is an avid supporter of contemporary ballet , so much so that he has made it is life 's work			1
his difficulty before arriving in @entity39 was the reluctance of some companies to move beyond the classics and into a new world of contemporary choreographed ballet			1
with the @entity116 , he told me he found a good balance			0
he said , " nowadays you ca n't have a relevant company in the world that does n't do modern and classical at the same time ... it really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet ( has been ) part of the cultural tradition for so long and at the same time they want to break through and do new things			1
" when i watch a ballerina move , i covet her grace , but perhaps more than anything , i am in awe of her strength			0
every move has purpose and precision			0
every muscle is alert and ready to perform on command			0
what look like light steps and twirls take body control akin to a boxer waiting to take his next punch			0
interestingly , some boxers look to ballet as part of their training , especially when it comes to moving their feet			2
it takes extreme discipline to move so lightly and so purposefully			0
discipline that makes each move look easy			0
a dancer on a stage is the culmination of years of discipline and passion for perfection ; years in which each move and each sequence is like oxygen to the dancer ... something they ca n't or wo n't live without			0
ballet is smooth and strong , pristine and powerful , romantic and riveting			2
even if you 're not an avid fan , i 'm sure you 'll develop at the very least , respect for this most graceful of art forms where dancers bend their bodies in moves that would be painful for mere mortals , but that they make look so easy .			2

in @entity39 there is a great respect for the heritage of ballet
@entity60 's new artistic director is @entity59
@entity59 is the first foreigner to lead a major dance company in @entity39 for over a century ago
there is a great debate over the merits of contemporary ballet versus those of the classics
