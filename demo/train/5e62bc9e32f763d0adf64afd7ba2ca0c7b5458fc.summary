@entity0 -- when the topic turned to contraception and reproductive rights at @entity1 's debate in @entity7 on wednesday , @entity2 went on the attack , saying that in 2008 " not once did anybody in the elite media ask why @entity11 voted in favor of legalizing infanticide			1
" it 's a striking claim , and he 's not the only @entity16 presidential candidate making it			1
speaking at the @entity19 last march , @entity18 said , " any child born prematurely , according to the president , in his own words , can be killed			1
" both @entity23 and @entity18 are referring to " born alive " bills that were brought up in the @entity25 in 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 when @entity11 was a state senator			1
the intent of the legislation was to protect any infant who survived a botched abortion by requiring the doctor to give life - saving care			0
in part , the bill said " a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law			0
" then - state sen. @entity11 opposed the legislation because he said it would undermine the legal protections given to abortions under @entity44			2
on the state @entity46 floor , @entity11 said he believed courts would eventually overturn the legislation since it would " essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child			2
" he added that @entity52 already had a 1975 state law that protected the life of an infant that survived a botched abortion , if doctors determined the infant could survive			0
when the legislation came up for a vote in 2001 and 2002 , @entity11 once voted " present " -- essentially a non-vote -- and once voted against it			1
in 2002 , @entity63 was also writing a " @entity65 " bill			0
@entity11 said several times he would support that version of the bill because it contained a clause that would protect the legal standing of @entity44			2
opponents of abortion rights , such as the @entity71 , challenged his explanation , saying the 2003 version of the @entity52 law contained language virtually identical to the federal law , so by his own logic he should have supported it			0
the new legislation never made it out of the @entity80 that he chaired			0
in 2008 , @entity82 correspondent and @entity1 contributor @entity81 asked then - presidential candidate @entity11 about the allegations that he supported infanticide			1
@entity11 responded by saying , " here 's a situation where folks are lying			2
i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in , fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported -- which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born -- even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion			0
that was not the bill that was presented at the state level			0
" after researching and analyzing the issue , two independent fact - checking groups , @entity103 and @entity104 both determined it 's not true to claim @entity11 supported legislation that said " any child born prematurely ... can be killed			1
" in fact , the @entity109 - winning @entity103 rated the @entity18 's assertion " pants on fire " -- its rating that a statement is " not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim			2
" then there 's the part of @entity23 's statement that the " elite media " ignored the story in 2008			1
in fact , a search on @entity123 shows at least eight times when it was mentioned or discussed in detail on @entity1 during the 2008 campaign			1
here are two specific examples : -- on june 30 , 2008 , @entity129 examined the evidence for " @entity131 " with this introduction : " some are calling @entity11 a baby - killer because of a bill he voted down while he was in the @entity136			1
it was called the @entity139 - alive @entity138 and it 's come back to haunt him			0
but is it fair ? " that piece was followed by political analysis on the same topic from @entity144 and @entity145			0
-- in his august 2008 interview , @entity81 asked then - presidential candidate @entity11 : " the born - alive infant protection act			1
i got to tell you , that 's the one thing i get a lot of e-mails about and it 's just not just from evangelicals -- it 's about @entity154 , @entity155 -- they 're trying to understand it because there was some literature put out by the @entity71			0
and they 're basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill			0

@entity16 presidential *hopeful* @entity2 says @entity11 voted for infanticide
@entity23 also said the media wo n't ask him about the issue
@entity18 has made similar charges recently
@entity1 and other research shows both charges are wrong
