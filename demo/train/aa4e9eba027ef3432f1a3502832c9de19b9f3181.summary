the @entity1 failed some of its students " for years " by allowing them to take classes that did not match its own academic standards , chancellor @entity0 has admitted			1
the concession -- the strongest since @entity1 was caught up in a fake - class scandal two years ago -- comes just weeks after a @entity10 investigation found continuing problems at @entity1 and other public universities where some student - athletes could read only at an elementary school level			1
two years ago , it was exposed that @entity1 students , many of them athletes , were given grades for classes they did not attend and for which they did nothing beyond turning in a single paper			2
one professor has been indicted on fraud charges for being paid for a class he did n't teach			0
the university has always maintained it was an isolated case , but @entity0 is now acknowledging a broader problem			0
" we also accept the fact that there was a failure in academic oversight for years that permitted this to continue , " @entity0 told @entity1 trustees last week			1
" this , too , was wrong			0
and it has undermined our integrity and our reputation			0
" @entity10 analysis : some college athletes play like adults , read like 5th - graders @entity10 has asked @entity1 for the number of students who were specially admitted because they did not meet the usual academic standards and who majored in or took the classes now acknowledged as fake			1
@entity10 investigated the issue of poor academics among student football and basketball players after a researcher at @entity1 revealed that some could not read well enough to follow news coverage about themselves or even read the word " @entity57			1
" the researcher , @entity58 , said student - athletes were among those who took the fake classes , though she said the classes were just a symptom of the problem of enrolling athletes in the money - making sports of football and basketball who could not succeed academically by themselves			1

@entity77 told @entity78 , whose parent company 's chairman is a @entity1 trustee , that he would investigate whether student - athletes were " clustering " in departments or classes that were supposed to have easy grades and to see whether there were any other forces or personalities behind the scandal			1
@entity1 told @entity10 last year it has a program that alerts it if too many athletes are enrolled in a single class , but it 's not yet clear whether this is different			2
