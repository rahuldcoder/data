@entity0 -- so , after a mere half - century , @entity5 pharmaceutical firm @entity3 has decided to apologize for the devastating effects its drug , thalidomide , had on thousands of babies and their families around the world , myself included			1
is this a reason to celebrate ? is it even a reason for cautious optimism , or is it simply a piece of news management designed to salvage what is left of its corporate reputation ? @entity3 's chief executive , @entity20 , made the apology friday as he inaugurated a memorial to those affected in @entity24 , @entity5 , where the company is based			1
i was aware of @entity26 long before his name was flashed around newsrooms all over the world when he made his momentous announcement			2
together with others , i 've been campaigning for justice for the global thalidomide community for the past decade			1
at one point @entity34 , who replaced @entity35 as head of @entity3 , agreed to a meeting			0
we held preliminary discussions , however the process broke down acrimoniously before we ever got to meet @entity34 after it became clear to all of us that the company had no intention of negotiating a lasting settlement -- one that would have kept them out of the headlines forever and which would have left the @entity35 family with its considerable fortune intact			2
personal account : a life shaped by bad medicine so why the apology now ? i think it is not unconnected with successful litigation in @entity57 that has resulted in a multi-million dollar settlement for a hitherto unrecognized thalidomide survivor , @entity59			1
although the settlement was achieved at the expense of the @entity63 and @entity57 successor company to the distributor of thalidomide , @entity64 , @entity3 was also named in proceedings			1
the writing was spray - painted on the wall for mr @entity20 and the board of @entity3			0
we believe the drug had its origins in the @entity74 death camps in @entity75 -- as uncovered by two solicitors working on behalf of survivors of thalidomide			1
it is also a matter of record that @entity3 's board in the 1950s included a prominent and convicted @entity74 war criminal , @entity85			2
respected historian and director of @entity88 , dr @entity89 , who has himself uncovered much damning evidence against @entity3 has said : " this is a company that has evil written into its dna			2
" earlier this year , @entity59 's lawyers lodged previously secret @entity3 records with an @entity57 court , revealing that for at least two years before the drug was removed from the market in late 1961 , @entity5 medical professionals had told the company 's staff they believed women who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy , had given birth to children with deformities			1
in the @entity112 , concerns were such that it was never approved for use by pregnant women			0
in march 1961 the board could have sensibly decided to withdraw thalidomide from the market in light of claims of birth defects and nerve damage to people taking it			2
instead it decided to carry on regardless -- there was far too much money to be made from peddling its toxic ' wonder drug '			0
the battle for financial redress will not end with this apology			1
in fact , if anything , it will make those still fighting for compensation even more resolute			0
in @entity57 there is a class action under way and in @entity142 , survivors there are launching their own legal action			2
we , in the @entity63 , are also continuing to work for a permanent settlement			0
so my advice to @entity26 and the @entity35 family is as follows : admit that the drug was not adequately tested prior to release ; admit that evidence of harmful side - effects was ignored and concealed ; and admit that crucial documents ' went missing ' and were unavailable to prosecutors in @entity5 in 1970 which would have proved corporate and individual guilt once and for all			0
those thalidomiders who are still alive are ageing -- and faster than we should because of our disabilities			0
to help us live as comfortably and independently as possible costs money			0
adaptations , medical costs and personal assistants are not cheap			0
@entity163 has deprived us of the lives we should have had and many more of any life at all			1
i believe that both morally and legally , @entity3 has a responsibility to help us and will continue to fight until that happens			0
the @entity35 family has grown fat on the backs of thousands of families whose lives have been torn apart by a medicine originally marketed as " totally without harm			0
" if they really want to make amends , they should put their entire wealth at the disposal of the world 's thalidomide survivors before it 's too late			1
@entity63 apologizes to thalidomide victims the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			1

@entity186 has been campaigning for justice for the global thalidomide community
" the battle for financial redress will not end with this apology , " he says .
" @entity163 has deprived us of the lives we should have had and many more of any life at all . "
