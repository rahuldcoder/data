it 's the earthquake that rocked the @entity1			1
in a year when mainstream @entity1 have mostly bested tea party - backed challengers , a little - known and little - funded @entity3 challenger in @entity6 's 7th @entity5 pulled the upset of the year , defeating @entity9 majority leader @entity8 by 10 percentage points			1
the victory by economics professor @entity12 gives the tea party an instant jolt of energy , sends shock waves through @entity16 , shakes up the @entity9 hierarchy -- as @entity8 was seen by many as the next speaker -- and effectively kills any chance of immigration reform passing through the @entity9 any time soon			1
" i think this is a scale eight earthquake			0
i think it will shock the @entity26 establishment ; it will shock the @entity28 , " former house speaker @entity23 said			0
" it certainly upsets the balance of power inside the @entity1 conference			2
and combined with the results last week in @entity38 , it sends a pretty strong signal that while money matters , voters may matter more , and people have to have a little respect for the right of the voter to have attention paid to them , and the right of the voter to throw people out if they 're not happy with them , " added @entity32 , a 2012 @entity1 presidential candidate and co-host of @entity35 's " @entity34			2
" @entity8 becomes only the second member of @entity52 running for re-election this year to go down in defeat in the primaries , following 91 - year - old @entity56 rep. @entity56 of @entity57			2
longtime sen. @entity58 of @entity38 may soon become the third			0
he 's fighting for his political life as he faces a primary runoff election in two weeks against a tea party - backed state senator who narrowly edged him in last week 's primary but not by enough to win outright			1
" this victory is the ' @entity72 ' equivalent of the adrenaline needle plunged into the chest of the tea party , " said @entity1 consultant @entity65 , who served as a top strategist and adviser to @entity9 and @entity69 @entity1 leaders			1
" they had largely conceded most of the @entity1 primaries to the establishment			2
" @entity78 , an anti-establishment leader and " @entity78 " chairman , proclaimed that " @entity8 's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the @entity1 establishment			1
the grass - roots is in revolt and marching			0
" @entity8 loses primary in big upset ; @entity87 avoids runoff how @entity8 lost in the primary 's closing days , aides close to @entity8 said they expected the majority leader to win around 60 % of the vote in his primary			1
he did n't come close			0
" obviously , we came up short , " the seven - term congressman told supporters as he conceded the race			0
@entity8 apparently did n't read the pulse of conservatives in his @entity1 - dominated district , which is anchored in the @entity102 area but stretches some 100 miles from the @entity103 to the outer reaches of the @entity26 exurbs			1
" @entity8 lost this race as much as @entity12 won it			2
two years ago , @entity8 got 37,000 votes in his primary			2
nine thousand fewer votes this time			0
he simply violated rule number one of politics : go home , " said @entity35 chief national correspondent @entity111			0
" this is @entity8 's fault			1
he was in @entity26 on primary day , not back in his district			0
" @entity8 also turned down last - minute help from political allies			2
" his confidence , his arrogance , his smugness cost him his seat , " @entity111 added			0
" my sense from talking to people in the 7th is that he had lost touch with the base of the @entity1 there , and by the time he realized it and tried to make amends , it was too late , " @entity6 political analyst @entity122 said			1
" the real problem that the ( tea party ) base had with @entity8 is that they got to where they did n't trust him , " added @entity122 , director of the @entity130 at @entity131			1
" the issue that broke the bank for him was immigration			0
they saw him say one thing in @entity26 , then say something else to them , and it caused deep distrust in the district			0
" @entity8 's campaign shelled out a couple of million dollars in television and radio ads to send its message that @entity8 was " a strong conservative			1
" it outspent @entity12 's by more than 10 to 1			0
to put it another way , @entity8 spent well over $ 100 for each vote that he won			2
brat spent around $ 5 per vote			0
in his victory speech , @entity12 told supporters , " dollars do not vote -- you do			0
" brat framed his challenge as another case of a grass - roots conservative taking on the @entity1 establishment , a major theme in @entity1 contests this year			2
and @entity12 made immigration reform the central issue and said @entity8 's position would hurt the economy			1
" the amnesty issue is the symbolic powerful expression about the difference between @entity176 on jobs , " @entity12 said			0
@entity8 has publicly supported proposals allowing children of those who enter the country illegally -- so - called dreamers -- the ability to obtain some type of legal status			2
but @entity8 opposed the bill passed by the @entity69 last year that included a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country			2
@entity8 's team pushed back , calling @entity12 , a " liberal college professor			1
" that worked against him , @entity122 said			0
" his negative turn played into this narrative that @entity8 could n't be trusted ... that he was out of touch with the conservative principles of the district , and was using @entity26 - style campaign tactics to beat his opponent down			2
" brat 's victory may have also been fueled by popular conservative talk radio host @entity201 , who was an early supporter			0
" the seeds for @entity12 's upset were sown on right - wing radio talk shows , particularly @entity201 's , " @entity35 senior media correspondent @entity203 said			0
" this time last week , @entity201 was busy headlining a giant rally for brat			0
on tuesday , her website implored fans to vote for him			0
" two pieces of irony : @entity8 's defeat comes just three days after @entity216 , meeting at their state party convention , nominated @entity219 -- the poster boy for " inside the beltway " @entity1 -- as the party 's @entity69 nominee			1
and @entity8 's loss also came on the same night that @entity1 sen. @entity87 of @entity224 , a frequent target of conservatives , easily bested six primary challengers from the right			1
aftershocks on @entity16 in his 13 years in @entity52 , @entity8 has rocketed up the ranks , all the way to majority leader , the no. 2 spot in the @entity9 @entity1 leadership			1
and @entity8 was seen by many as biding his time until the eventual retirement of house speaker @entity238			0
now that succession is upended , and @entity8 's defeat will only embolden the powerful tea party wing in the @entity9			1
conservatives will most likely demand that @entity8 be replaced with someone on the right			0
" it 's going to speed up the process of tea party members positioning themselves for a leadership run			1
this stunning news could be the first shot in an all - out war between the establishment and tea party over leadership control , " said @entity65 , the @entity1 consultant			1
the no. 3 house @entity1 , majority whip @entity257 , is popular among members and has chits from many of the freshman and sophomores he helped elect			0
but because he 's part of the current @entity1 leadership lineup , many tea party groups and members on the right of the conference do n't trust him as a solid conservative			1
he is likely to want to move up to @entity8 's post , but could draw a challenge			1
some are floating @entity275 chairman @entity274 's name , but a source close to the 2012 @entity1 vice presidential nominee calls those rumors " baseless and unfounded " and notes that @entity274 batted down questions about his interest in any run for the top spot			2
but because the news of @entity8 's defeat is still sinking in , members are still calling around and testing the temperature for what should happen next			1
@entity8 's defeat also effectively kills any hopes that the @entity9 will pass an immigration reform bill			1
" it 's going to be a tough case to make that immigration is going to be brought to the @entity9 floor anytime soon , " @entity65 said			1
@entity35 senior political analyst @entity294 agreed			0
" for @entity8 to be knocked off by a tea party conservative over his efforts to push for immigration reform and his earlier efforts to lift the debt ceiling , i think it will send shock waves through @entity1 ranks			1
" look at the price he paid for doing things the majority of @entity306 support , " said @entity294 , a senior adviser to both @entity308 and @entity1 presidents			0
@entity8 challenger , @entity12 , ' shocked ' as results rolled in @entity87 defeats conservative challengers , avoids runoff			0

@entity8 's loss shakes up @entity1 leadership , kills hope for immigration reform in @entity9
@entity320 's win also gives jolt of energy to tea party movement
