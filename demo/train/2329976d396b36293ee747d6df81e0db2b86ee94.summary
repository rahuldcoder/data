-- who in their right mind would swap the south of @entity4 for the @entity5 in the middle of winter ? a team of @entity10 specialists testing the aircraft manufacturer 's latest @entity11 , that 's who			1
last week a team of engineers , mechanics and test pilots from the @entity19 - based company performed various extreme - weather trials on a test plane in @entity22 , the capital of @entity24 's eastern @entity5 territory of @entity25			1
the ground and in - air tests included operating the aircraft in temperatures reaching down to @entity30 ( -28 degrees @entity31 ) , thrust - reversed tests with snow and a local flight test			2
like all new planes , the new model must be tested in extreme environmental condition , from freezing to intense heat			0
" coming to an extreme place means we can break everything , " @entity10 ' head of flight operations @entity39 told local reporters			2
extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways			0
metals , such as steel and aluminum , contract at different rates			0
lubricants may lose their viscosity , creating friction and wear issues for moving parts			0
meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle			0
the cold - weather tests in @entity24 came only days after the @entity62 test plane completed high - altitude test in @entity64			1
next stop is @entity66 for hot - weather testing			2
how airports beat bad weather for years @entity22 , located on @entity70 , has marketed itself as " a premier cold - weather test site			1
" @entity10 have tested there since the 1990s , while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 to perform similar trials			1
but cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places			2
in april 2010 @entity75 chose @entity81 in @entity82 as the location for extreme - weather testing on its @entity85			1
in a test chamber the aircraft was given a " cold soak " and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees @entity89 ( -42.7 degrees @entity31 ) for hours			0
later , it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees @entity89 ( 46 degrees @entity31 ) , also for hours			0

" these tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe ( and in all seasons ) , " said @entity94 , vice president of marketing at @entity95 , in a press statement			0
but extreme - weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of @entity107			1
initially scheduled for five days , @entity10 ' tests in @entity22 were cut short , not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees @entity31 -- too warm for the cold weather testing			1

@entity10 cold - weather tested its @entity11 *passenger* *jet* in @entity22 , @entity24
the @entity5 town has marketed itself as " a premier cold - weather test site . "
@entity75 did extreme - weather trials on its @entity85 in @entity82
