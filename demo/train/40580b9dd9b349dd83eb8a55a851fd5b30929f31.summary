@entity0 , a small @entity1 town , is considering a measure that would allow its residents to hunt for federal drones and shoot them down			1
" is it illegal ? of course it is			2
but it 's also illegal to spy on @entity13 citizens , " resident @entity8 told @entity9 in a phone interview			0
" if they fly in town , we will shoot them down			0
" @entity8 said he wrote the ordinance after he learned the @entity23 " loosened regulations that would allow the flight of drones in domestic airspace			1
" the @entity23 recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country , none of which has been publicly listed			1
it plans to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015			1
" the overall purpose of this test site program is to develop a body of data and operational experiences to inform integration and the safe operation of these aircraft in the @entity40 , " the agency said			0
drones are cheaper to operate than helicopters			1
they can be used for multiple tasks , such as monitoring crops and livestock and assessing building damage			0
@entity0 , which bills itself as the " @entity49 's @entity48 , " has 584 residents and is 50 miles outside @entity51			1
the entire town takes up less than one square mile			0
any resident can petition for a citizens ' initiative and then draft an ordinance			0
bounties and shotguns the @entity60 will vote on the drone ordinance on august 6			1
if passed , it would legalize the sale of drone hunting licenses for $ 25 and offer bounties for captured drones			1
six trustees and the mayor make up the board			0
it would take a simple majority vote to pass the ordinance			0
" it is very symbolic ... it 's asserting our right and drawing a line in the sand , " @entity8 said			0
" it declares sovereignty of the airspace			0
" the ordinance does n't aim to stop airliner flights , he said			2
it outlines the rules of engagement for drone hunters and the types of ammunition allowed			2
@entity89 amounts from $ 25 to $ 100 , and weapons are limited to 12 - gauge shotguns			1
it states that " no background investigation shall be performed " on those seeking a drone hunting license			1
additionally , the licenses would be " issued on an anonymous basis			2
" " unmanned aerial vehicles may be engaged at a vertical distance of one thousand feet or less , " and the " licenses shall only remain valid within the geographic boundaries of the @entity102 , @entity1 , " according to the ordinance			2
federal legislation ( 18 @entity105 1361 ) prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property and establishes provisions for fines and imprisonment			1
the illegality of the actions within the ordinance does n't scare @entity8			0
" i took an oath when i joined the military to protect the @entity13 @entity115			0
that oath did not end when i left , " he said			0
when asked if he had ever seen a drone in @entity0 , @entity8 said , " in real life , no. i hope i never see a drone in @entity0			1
... this ordinance is a statement against the coming surveillance society			1
it 's a very clear statement against that			2
" " in all practicality , nobody is going to shoot down any drones any time soon , " he added			2
' our mark on the map ' town clerk @entity132 says she believes the ordinance could benefit the town			0
" this could actually be something to help fund a community center or build us some roads			0
we need to find our mark on the map , " @entity132 said			0
" the novelty of being allowed to buy a drone - hunting license could turn into a fun thing			1
" board of trustees member @entity144 said the ordinance has a good chance of passing			0
" i think it 's important			0
i know @entity151 also wants to make a statement about drones			1
... mostly for us , the outcome we want will be to have some fun and make some money , " @entity144 said			2
@entity0 mayor @entity158 says he agrees with @entity144			1
he said the purpose of the ordinance would be " to have fun and bring in business , tourism and activities for people in town			2
" @entity1 attorney general @entity167 said state residents have a sense of humor			1
he responded to the idea of the ordinance by saying , " a resolution by the town of @entity0 to allow the hunting of drones is made in the same spirit as the proposal of some rural @entity179 to create a separate state			1
and both ideas have the same chance to legally succeed : none			0

@entity0 aims to sell drone hunting licenses for $ 25 , offer bounties for downed drones
proposed **law** is " a statement against the coming surveillance society , " its *author* says
but federal **law** prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property
city officials aim for financial gain , fun ; state official cites @entity203 ' sense of humor
