president @entity0 on friday announced that virtually all @entity2 troops will come home from @entity4 by the end of the year -- at which point he can declare an end to @entity2 's long and costly war in that @entity10 nation			1
" after nearly nine years , @entity2 's war in @entity4 will be over , " @entity0 said			1
" the coming months will be a season of homecomings			0
our troops in @entity4 will definitely be home for the holidays			2
" of the 39,000 troops in @entity4 , about 150 , a negligible force , will remain to assist in arms sales , a @entity2 official told @entity22			1
the rest will be out of @entity4 by december 31			0
the president said he was making good on his 2008 campaign pledge to end a war that has divided the nation since it began in 2003 and claimed more than 4,400 @entity2 @entity29 announcement also came after talks that might have allowed a continued major military presence broke down amid disputes about whether @entity2 troops would be immune to prosecution by @entity4 authorities			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity4 president @entity36 in a video conference friday , after which he said both nations were comfortable with the decision on how to move forward			2
the new partnership with @entity4 will be " strong and enduring , " @entity0 said			2
" the last @entity2 soldier will cross the border out of @entity4 with their head held high , proud of their success and knowing that the @entity2 people stand united in our support for our troops , " @entity0 said			1
according to a statement from the @entity4 prime minister 's office , @entity36 and @entity0 " shared the same point of view on the need to start a new phase of strategic relations			1
" that includes agreeing to a high - level meeting within two weeks			0
beyond the human cost , the price tag for @entity2 military activity in @entity4 has been steep as well			2
a report from the non-partisan , government - funded @entity65 found that the @entity66 spent nearly $ 757 billion for military operations in @entity4 over the past decade , $ 50 billion higher than the estimate released by the @entity66			0
another $ 41 billion for @entity4 was spent on @entity71 and @entity72 initiatives , plus $ 6 billion for troops ' health expenses , the @entity65 report stated			0
@entity75 -- an @entity76 soldier who heads the @entity77 , the first and largest such organization for these veterans , according to its website -- cheered friday 's announcement as " really good news for the troops serving overseas			0
" " it 's a really poignant time , especially for the veterans community , " @entity75 told @entity22			0
" many of us gave large parts of our lives , some gave all in support of @entity92 and @entity92			0
" while @entity94 largely applauded friday 's announcement , some @entity93 disagreed with the president			0
sen. @entity96 called it a " consequential failure " for the @entity0 administration , which he said was n't focused on succeeding in @entity4 , and @entity4 's government			1
" today marks a harmful and sad setback for the @entity2 in the world , " said @entity96 , an @entity101 @entity93 who faced off against @entity0 in the 2008 presidential election			2
" this decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our enemies in the @entity10 , especially the @entity110 regime , which has worked relentlessly to ensure a full withdrawal of @entity2 troops from @entity4			1
" deputy national security adviser @entity113 dismissed the notion that friday 's decision would affect @entity110 , which he claimed already is " weaker and more isolated " due to @entity2 and allied efforts unrelated to @entity4			1
" we do n't need to try to exercise our influence on those matters through @entity4 , " @entity113 told reporters friday			0
" we 're obviously concerned about @entity110 's willingness to live up to its obligations ... but we do n't have concerns about our ability to make sure that the @entity4 can exercise the kind of sovereignty that they want			1
" another @entity2 official -- who is not authorized to speak for attribution -- acknowledged that " the @entity110 have been trying to gain influence in @entity4 for some time , " but stressed that " @entity110 influence in @entity4 has limits			1
" the official said the @entity4 " will not roll over " to @entity110 , with whom it has a long history of border disputes including a bloody eight - year war in the 1980s			1
the current @entity137 had called for @entity2 troops to leave by the end of 2011			1
but lengthy negotiations in recent months had led some to expect that @entity2 troops -- roughly 40,000 of which are in @entity4 -- would remain there into next year			1
these talks , however , broke down over the prickly issue of legal immunity for @entity2 troops in @entity4 , a senior @entity2 military official with direct knowledge of the discussions told @entity22 this month			1
@entity2 defense secretary @entity149 and other top brass have repeatedly said any deal to keep @entity2 troops in @entity4 beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for @entity2 soldiers			1
but the @entity4 refused to agree to that , opening up the prospect of @entity2 being tried in @entity4 courts and subjected to @entity4 punishment			2
the negotiations were strained following @entity162 ' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged @entity4 civilians , including children , were killed in a 2006 raid by @entity2 troops rather than in an airstrike as the @entity2 military initially reported			1
@entity2 troops have already started the drawdown			1
for instance , a brigade from @entity172 , @entity173 , that was originally scheduled to be among the last to leave @entity4 was being pulled out of the country months ahead of its planned departure , military officials told @entity22 last week			0
besides withdrawing more units , others will not head overseas as planned			0
that includes about 775 @entity183 - based soldiers from the @entity185 's @entity184 , which announced friday it will not deploy to @entity4 in december as previously scheduled			2
gen. @entity186 , commander of @entity2 forces in @entity4 , has said that @entity4 would n't be able to defend its borders if @entity2 troops pulled out and also questioned @entity4 forces ability to defend its airspace			1
but @entity149 , en route to @entity192 , said history shows that @entity4 will be ready			0
" we 've taken out now about 100,000 troops and yet the level of violence has remained relatively low , " the defense secretary said			0
" and i think that 's a reflection of the fact that the @entity4 have developed a very important capability here to be able to respond to security threats within their own country			0
" regardless , officials insisted that the drastic pullback of troops does not mean an end to the @entity2 government 's presence in @entity4			1
@entity71 spokesman @entity210 described friday 's development as the start of " a new chapter in our relationship " with @entity4 -- while acknowledging the challenges of the change			2
" you ca n't flip a switch and go from a military operation to a civilian operation ; there has to be a transition and we 're working on that transition , " he said			0
" but we believe we 're ready			0
" @entity210 also noted substantial improvements in the capabilities of the @entity4 , even as he admitted the continued importance of addressing " security needs " of the hundreds of nonmilitary @entity2 personnel who will remain there			2
that includes about 1,700 diplomats , law enforcement officers and various economic , agriculture and other professionals and experts who will be in @entity4 into 2012 , according to the @entity71			0
in addition , 5,000 security contractors will protect the @entity2 diplomats and another 4,500 contractors will serve other roles , such as helping provide food and medical services , until they can be done locally			0
@entity210 said the @entity2 and @entity4 governments are still talking about security and other matters , though he stressed any such discussions should not change the basic decision announced friday			2
" we continue to talk about the post-december 31 arrangement ( and ) security relationship , " @entity210 said			0
" at the same time , we are very committed to meeting the december 31 deadline			0
" @entity149 , too , did not rule out the possibility that @entity2 forces would head to @entity4 to train forces there			1
" as we ... look at developing this normal relationship , a lot of it is going to depend on what they want , what their needs are and how we can best meet them , " he said .			0

@entity2 defense chief says @entity4 forces are capable
a @entity2 official says @entity4 " will not roll over " to @entity110 trying to exert their influence
@entity4 's prime minister says he and @entity0 both want to " start a new phase " in relations
almost all @entity2 troops will be home by the end of december , according to @entity0
