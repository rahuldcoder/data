if you 're trying to create the perfect 21st - century city , it helps to start with a blank slate			2
even if that slate is a sweltering strip of sand			0
that 's essentially what the government of @entity9 and its developers are trying with @entity12 , an ambitious planned city on 28 square miles of waterfront desert along the @entity15			1
now under construction , the compact city will contain a commercial district , a lagoon , four islands , two marinas , an upscale shopping mall , a hospital , a zoo , two golf courses and housing for some 250,000 people			2
it also will feature an 86,000 - seat soccer stadium , surrounded by a moat , that 's expected to host the final game of the @entity32			1
residents and visitors will get around via a light - rail network , a water - taxi system and a network of underground pedestrian tunnels			0
and all the energy , communications and transportation systems will be run with the help of computers from a single command center , making @entity12 a " smart " city that can automatically adapt to changing traffic and weather conditions			1
" it 's very much an opportunity to build a vision of the future , " said @entity49 , senior vice president at @entity50 , the global architectural firm that designed @entity12 's @entity52 shopping center			1
funded by the oil - rich @entity9 government , @entity12 can offer innovative solutions to urban problems because it 's being built from the ground up			1
for example , the city 's gas , electric and water lines are being laid out in an underground network of tunnels , allowing for maintenance work that wo n't disrupt buildings , roads or people above			2
the city will be fitted with a network of surveillance cameras , monitored around the clock , to keep streets safe			0
city of tomorrow : 15 futuristic buildings buildings will be cooled by solar power and chilled water pumped through a vast network of pipes , which the city 's developers say is cheaper and more energy efficient than electrical air conditioning			0
human waste will be disposed not through sewer lines but a more efficient network of pneumatic , or vacuum tubes , not unlike the ones at your bank 's drive - up window			0
related story : should smart cities be built from scratch ? some 20,000 workers -- a small city unto itself -- are building @entity12 at an estimated cost of $ 45 billion			1
developers hope to complete the city by 2019 , three years before @entity9 is scheduled to become the first @entity107 country to host the @entity32			1
but all the city 's sparkling features will lose some of their luster if soccer 's big global tournament gets moved to another locale			0
some activists have been pressuring @entity115 , soccer 's international governing body , to reconsider @entity9 for a variety of reasons : allegations of bribery , the country 's condemnation of homosexuality and the blistering summer heat , which can reach 120 degrees @entity125			1
there also have been allegations that @entity9 has used slave labor -- mostly migrant workers from @entity130 -- to build @entity12 's infrastructure			1
a report last year by the @entity133 , the @entity134 newspaper , said at least 44 construction workers had died of heart attacks and other ailments in a two - month period of 2013 amid grueling conditions			0
the state - run @entity139 , which is spearheading construction of the city , has said it 's " extremely concerned " about the slave - labor allegations			1
in a statement on its website , the company added that it 's investigating the charges , which involve one of its subcontractors			0
" @entity12 will not tolerate breaches of labor or health and safety law , " the company said in the statement , posted in response to the @entity133 article			2
it declined to respond to @entity160 's requests for comment			0
city of tomorrow : how oceans can help solve our water crisis in response to criticisms , @entity9 in may announced reforms to its labor laws , which had bound workers to a single employer and left them open to exploitation			1
this appeared to satisfy @entity115 president @entity174 , who called the changes " a significant step in the right direction			2
" as for the brutal heat , @entity9 says its stadiums will contain advanced , open - air cooling systems that will keep @entity32 players and fans comfortable			1
meanwhile , @entity12 continues to rise slowly in the @entity9 desert			1
anchoring the city 's skyline will be four commercial towers , up to 75 stories each			0
these will be surrounded by five - star hotels , an entertainment district and the @entity52 , a retail palace measuring more than 600,000 square feet			0
scheduled to open in 2017 , the mall is a cluster of five interconnected pods , shaped like giant boulders , with cantilevered white roofs to repel the heat			0
its architects want the space to evoke desert canyons			0
a canal runs through it , and waterfalls splash throughout			0
the scope and design of the mall echoes the grand , futuristic vision for @entity12 itself			2
" it is a very ambitious and optimistic plan , " said @entity208 , a senior vice president in @entity50 's @entity210 office			0
it 's a plan that has helped land @entity9 the @entity32			1
but @entity208 said @entity12 will be completed even if @entity115 has a change of heart and finds a new host for the event			1
" @entity9 has a path ... they 're pursuing , " he said			2
" it wo n't affect their decision to move forward and get it built			0

@entity12 is an ambitious planned city rising along the @entity15 in @entity9
its infrastructure will be run by computers , making @entity12 a " smart " city
a @entity12 stadium is expected to host the final game of the @entity32
but @entity115 is under pressure to move the event to another country
