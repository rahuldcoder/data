@entity0 , @entity1 -- on @entity5 's ramshackle farm , there is little to suggest that he is producing a highly sought - after luxury item			1
the buildings on the farm look like a strong wind could carry them away			0
there is virtually no machinery			0
but @entity5 grows the tobacco leaves that are transformed into @entity1 cigars			1
and much of the allure of these legendary , expensive cigars is that they are still made entirely by hand and in places , like @entity5 's farm , that seem trapped in time			2
" as you can see , we do things the traditional way , " @entity5 said , gesturing to the barn where green tobacco leaves are hung to dry before being rolled into cigars			2
he and the rest of @entity1 's tobacco farmers might soon have their work cut out for them			1
executives from @entity34 , the @entity1 - @entity36 joint venture that distributes @entity1 cigars , announced at their annual festival last week that sales were up over 9 % in 2011			1
that growth , executives said , could indicate that the market for luxury goods is rebounding despite a still - shaky world economy			2
the festival was also bursting at the seams , with 1,500 attendees from 60 countries paying top dollar to taste @entity1 's best smokes			1
" things are going well , " said @entity49 , @entity1 's trade and foreign finance minister , as he toured the festival in @entity53			1
" the cigar has been appreciated since @entity56 landed here			2
and it will continue to be , because they are very good			0
" as good as they might be , @entity1 cigars are illegal in the @entity61 because of the @entity61 trade embargo with @entity1			1
" the embargo is something that affects everyone , " said @entity63 , co-president of @entity34			0
" it affects us as a country , as a business , and it affects the @entity61 consumer			0
they ca n't buy directly from @entity1 , so they have no way of knowing if they are buying genuine @entity1 cigars			1
" many of the @entity1 cigars that are available on the black market in the @entity61 are probably fakes , cigar experts say			1
@entity1 is also awash in knockoffs			1
tourists on the island receive near - constant offers from peddlers selling imitations at prices far below what the government stores sells genuine cigars for			2
" smoke a fake cigar , and you will not find the right blend , " said @entity90 , @entity34 ' director of marketing			2
" you are going to find something totally different , and probably ( you ) will be disappointed			0
" cigar makers responded last week by unveiling security measures , such as holograms and serial numbers , on the labels of some premium brands			1
" we have included a number of security elements into the band which makes them unique and impossible to copy , " said @entity102 , president of @entity103			0
cigar distributor @entity108 has traveled from @entity110 more than 10 times to attend the @entity34 festival			1
she said she is brought back by her love of cigars and desire to stay up to date on the industry			0
" you get to try stuff before anyone else , so that 's a nice perk , " she said			0
" and it 's people united by the same passion			0
you can smoke anywhere , you can get them fresh out of a roller 's hands			0
it really is an art to be appreciated			0

*hundreds* of people from across the world visit @entity1 every year for its annual cigar festival
@entity1 cigars are *renowned* for their *quality* , *craftsmanship*
sales of the cigars were up 9 % last year , according to their distributor
knockoffs are common , so cigar makers are *implementing* new security measures
