-- a house that tracks your every movement through your car and automatically heats up before you get home			0
a toaster that talks to your refrigerator and announces when breakfast is ready through your tv			0
a toothbrush that tattles on kids by sending a text message to their parents			0
exciting or frightening , these connected devices of the futuristic " smart " home may be familiar to fans of science fiction			1
now the tech industry is making them a reality			1
mundane physical objects all around us are connecting to networks , communicating with mobile devices and each other to create what 's being called an " @entity28 , " or @entity28			1
smart homes are just one segment -- cars , clothing , factories and anything else you can imagine will eventually be " smart " as well			1
but there 's a catch : so far , most @entity28 products have been a messy tangle of different wireless protocols and brands			1
many can communicate with their own apps and ecosystems but have n't found a way to play nice with each other			0
the @entity47 , which can adapt to your energy - consumption habits , is just one example			0
these standalone devices and ecosystems are running their own proprietary software and speaking different languages			2
your smart toaster is humming along in @entity56 , for example , while your fridge is babbling about dairy expiration dates in @entity60			0
now chipmaker @entity61 is trying to give the industry a major push with an open - source project that can link all these disparate pieces			0
@entity61 is hoping its platform , called @entity67 , could act as a sort of universal translator for the industry			0
over the past four years , @entity61 has been working on its @entity67 protocol to connect devices from different manufacturers , even if they have different communication standards			1
it wants to be the de facto language your fridge , lightbulbs and garage door all use to communicate			2
" the only way that vision can be realized is if we turn this into a true panindustrial effort with companies all over the world , " said @entity80 , @entity61 's senior director of product management			2
choosing a standard many standards already help smart devices communicate , though none has emerged as a dominant option yet			2
some companies , such as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , depend on a physical hub to link devices			2
experts say this market will struggle to really take off until someone can convince the major players it 's in their best interest to work with other brands			2
" we could see a few large ecosystems emerge for ( the @entity28 ) , such as we have today with @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
but consumers like to have choices and will demand that closed systems learn to communicate with each other , " explained @entity111 , president of the @entity112			0
if there are too many different ecosystems , people will find a way to connect them -- much like how the problem of multiple phone chargers is being solved by @entity123 , she said			2
" because ( the @entity28 ) is so vast and varied , it will be hard to come up with a ' one size fits all ' standard , " said @entity111			1
" instead of a single , dominant communication standard for @entity28 , there will likely be several that serve different purposes			1
" a company with as much industry clout as @entity61 might have luck bridging some of the gaps			2
it 's a smart business move : the wireless technology giant makes many of the chips found in smartphones and tablets			2
it also sells the chips that will go inside smart thermostats , security systems , cars and everything else			0
but the connected - things revolution will only work if all the companies and products find a way to break out of their silos and work together , according to @entity150			1
" oftentimes we kind of think about the evolution of the internet in two revolutions			0
the first revolution was the connected @entity28 , " she said			1
" the second kind of revolution was when we suddenly went to the mobile internet			0
" being able to access the internet from our pockets is n't just revolutionary because it is portable			0
the devices collect and share information about us using built - in sensors , such as accelerometers and gps			1
the @entity28 becomes a two - way street where we share context about our location , environment and habits so it can serve up customized information			1
a third revolution @entity150 predicts the @entity28 will be the third revolution			1
sensors will show up in more and more devices and turn them into sponges that soak up data about our habits , environment , movements and health			1
a smart smoke detector , for example , might also gather information about the pollen count in a house			0
a home security system 's motion detectors can track a family 's movements and location over time , sharing information with a central heating or cooling system to customize each room 's temperature			0
but it 's still to early to say for sure how all these devices will chat with each other and whether @entity61 's @entity67 or some other option will take off			1
the exact killer apps for the @entity28 are also a mystery			1
we wo n't really know how the technology will change our lives until we get it into the hands of creative developers			0
" the guys who had been running mobile for 20 years had no idea that some developer was going to take the touchscreen and microphone and some graphical resources and turn a phone into a flute , " @entity150 said			0
the same may be true when developers start experimenting with apps for connected home appliances			1
" exposing that , how your toothbrush and your water heater and your thermostat ... are going to interact with you , with your school , that 's what 's next , " said @entity150 .			0

with the @entity28 , regular appliances and objects could evolve into tech products
sensors will appear in cars , homes , toasters , clothing and more
one company is trying to connect all of those devices with a common language
expert : connected devices are the @entity28 's third revolution
