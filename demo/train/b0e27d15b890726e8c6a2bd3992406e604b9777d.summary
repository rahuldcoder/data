-- " sing it if you know it , " @entity1 's @entity0 told the crowd sunday night in @entity7 , on the @entity8 , as the band prepared to play " @entity10			1
" then he added , " i tell myself that before every song			0
' sing it like you know it ! be the ball ! be the snare , @entity17 ! ' " he did n't need to worry			0
in the group 's first @entity21 gig since 1999 , @entity0 not only remembered all the words to the old @entity1 songs , he and the rest of the band brought new flair to them			2
the 90s indie princes buzzed through their insanely fat songbook , 27 brilliant tunes in 90 minutes , without letting the energy level dip , lurching into each song with all their boyish enthusiasm			1
it was like a mix tape of the livelier moments from their 90s shows , except more so			2
all year long , on their first tour since they fell apart in 1999 , @entity1 have shown other bands how you do the reunion thing right : no new songs , no pompous gestures , just a celebration of the catalog that made them the great guitar band of the 90s			2
the audience on sunday night was surprisingly young , and unsurprisingly baked , but they were there to celebrate the 90s as well			0
@entity0 got one of the night 's biggest cheers when he looked around at the @entity7 waterfront and mused , " we saw a @entity54 show around here			1
" @entity2 : see vintage shots of @entity0 and more nineties rockers @entity1 hopped from songs everybody likes ( " @entity62 , " " @entity63 " ) to songs hardly anybody ever notices ( " @entity65 , " " @entity66 " ) , dipping into psychedelic jams like " grounded " between sing - along raves like " @entity69 " and " @entity70			1
" @entity0 and @entity71 traded guitar leads in the countryfied ballad " @entity76 , " giving it a whole new flavor			1
drummer @entity77 and bassist @entity78 were nimbler than ever , while percussionist / hype man @entity79 banged the tambourine , sang back - up , blew harmonica , and played a mean slide whistle solo on " fight this generation			1
" he also slow - danced with a lucky lady as @entity0 crooned " we dance			1
" @entity2 : @entity1 's @entity87 by @entity88 that song was a reminder of how much musical ground pavement covered			0
they were the band who could do it all , mixing up @entity21 noise with @entity97 stoner vibes , @entity99 art - punk with suburban @entity101 hardcore , yet make it all flow like rock & roll , and make it all seem like a breeze			0
they combined the elements of indie rock that fans were used to getting in half - assed dribbles and drabs			2
so " @entity121 " was the best @entity114 song ever , just as " @entity117 " was the best @entity116 song ever -- yet these were just another couple of great @entity1 songs			0
sunday night they blasted through " @entity69 , " with a melody swiped from @entity124 ( " everyday , " to be exact ) , plus a throwaway guitar hook swiped from @entity126 ( " @entity127 , " to be exact ) , and made it crest and surge for three wildly emotional minutes of punk rock			0
who else wrote songs like this ? everybody tried to			0
but only @entity1 pulled it off			0
@entity136 bastards , these guys			0
the show ended on a high note with " @entity140 , " a wittily poignant ballad about the passing of youth			1
as he walked offstage after " @entity140 , " @entity0 indulged in his only cornball rock - star gesture of the night -- he tried to toss a guitar pick into the crowd			1
but it missed , and plopped pitifully onto the stage			0
@entity0 shrugged , laughed , and kept walking			2
