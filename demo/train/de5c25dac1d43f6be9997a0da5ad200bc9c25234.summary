he had seizures in his dorm room , while driving , in class and on a trip to @entity15			1
@entity1 , 29 , has epilepsy , and feels so strongly about educating people about the complex brain disorder and the seizures that stem from it that he became the project coordinator for the @entity23			1
when he heard that @entity7 commerce secretary @entity24 had a seizure while driving in @entity26 , @entity1 was empathetic			1
" it seems that some people have been so quick to judge him			1
it just goes to show you that there are so many misconceptions , " @entity1 said of @entity24 , who is under investigation after allegedly causing two car accidents last week			2
" it 's such a dramatic and stressful period as it is			2
i can only imagine what he is going through			2
this is all happening in the spotlight			2

" it is unclear what caused @entity24 's seizure , which officials said was his first			1
the @entity24 has resigned , telling president @entity48 he 's doing so for health reasons , according to a statement obtained by @entity0			0

" i think it 's important for people to understand you can be ok			1
you can function at a very high level			0
most of the time , 70 % of the cases are easily controlled , easily managed			2
" yet a large number of people go about their daily lives hiding the fact that they have seizures because they are concerned such disclosures would negatively affect their lives , she said			1
" lots of things contribute to that stigma and that embarrassment , " @entity141 said			0
" it 's a disorder of the brain , and the public does n't understand it in terms of what it looks like and what it is and what they need to do to keep someone from having a seizure safe			1
" the fact that seizures can happen any time and in public makes it difficult for some people with epilepsy , she added			1
@entity190 , 46 , of @entity143 knows that problem all too well			0
" i know that 's one of the main fears for people that have epilepsy -- telling other people			1
you always have that fear of that person 's reaction			0
we have a wall up sometimes , " he said			0

we 're trying to protect ourselves			0

everyone at work knows he has epilepsy , he said			2

you should n't keep it hidden			0
you do want people to know			2
" still , it is n't always easy , @entity190 said			0
" you feel embarrassed when you are coming out of it , " he said			0

" when @entity190 heard about @entity24 , he said he was immediately relieved no one was hurt			0
" i have had one before when i was driving , " @entity190 said			0
" i know the fear behind that			0
when you come out of it , you do n't know what happened			0
you are just hoping you did n't injure anyone			0
" @entity237 , 63 , a retired parole agent in @entity26 , had his first seizure in 1999 while driving his daughter 's car			2
he was later told that he got off the freeway , hit a black van and just kept going			0

then she looks at the clock to time the seizure and tries to turn her husband on his side to help him breathe			2
she tries to stay calm and talk to her husband			0
at some point , @entity237 understands his wife is talking to him			0
" i 'll hear my wife and she 'll tell me , ' @entity237 , @entity237 , ' " he said			0

i just ca n't do the things she wants me to do			0
" the lack of control is something you have to deal with , said people living with seizures			1
" you become 200 % vulnerable to your surroundings and to ( other people 's ) knowledge of what is happening to you , " said @entity1 of the @entity282			1
" if i have a seizure in public and i 'm next to a bunch of broken glass , are they going to be able to react ? are they going to forgive me when i ca n't react and listen to them ? it 's part of the education process			2
your brain has just suffered this huge electrical brainstorm			1
" @entity141 said anyone living with epilepsy that is not well - controlled should seek out neurologists who are highly trained in managing epilepsy			2
she and others urge people to seek out information about seizures and epilepsy			1
