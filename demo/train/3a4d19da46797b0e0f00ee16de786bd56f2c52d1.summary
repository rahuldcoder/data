@entity0 , @entity1 -- some are girlish 22 - year - olds ; others are women approaching 40			1
they come from @entity1 's rural counties and its booming cities			1
they are loud and muted , lively and vacant , hopeful and desperate			0
as different as they are , they share a connection to two powerful forces : their addictions and their babies			0
they are swallowed by the same shameful past			0
they do n't know if they can be good mothers			2
they do n't know if they can be clean mothers			2
they 're here at a state - run drug - treatment program to learn how to do both			2
on this summer day , @entity24 , 24 , is eight months pregnant with her first child and one of 16 women at the @entity29 's @entity28			1
this is her last shot to get clean -- or face jail			0
@entity1 's state supreme court is alone in upholding the prosecution of pregnant women for the damage drugs might do to their unborn children			1
across the country , local and state agencies have found ways to prosecute pregnant women for drug use , but the cases are often rejected by the courts			1
and judges in more than two dozen states have overturned decisions that criminalize pregnant addicts			1
in recent years , @entity47 and @entity48 have ruled against charging pregnant women with neglect and endangerment			1
illegal substances -- marijuana , methamphetamine , cocaine and prescription drugs -- consumed @entity24 for more than a decade			1
" to this day , i still cry about it , " she said , " that if anything does come out wrong with my baby , i know that my drug use is the reason why			0
since 1989 , at least 126 women in @entity1 have been arrested during their pregnancies , according to the @entity63			1
most were charged with drug and alcohol use that posed harm to the fetus the woman was carrying			0
during the same period , only about 80 pregnant women were arrested on similar charges in all other states combined			1
" @entity72 " in @entity1 , says @entity76 , program manager of a drug - treatment facility in @entity78 , " is if you use during pregnancy , you 're being prosecuted or you 're losing your baby			1
" over the last 15 years , that message has driven many women to @entity28 , a residential treatment center designed for pregnant women and new mothers			1
here , the ultimate goal is to help the women recover from their addiction but @entity87 also strives to give the women the confidence to become better mothers			1
they want the women to know there are second chances , and there is hope			2
" i 'm grateful everyday for being here and i 'm grateful to have my baby with me , " says a freckled @entity97 , 28 , who gave birth to her son @entity100 at the center			0
" i 've been using drugs since i was 11 years old			0
i did n't know any other life			2
and i 've learned a lot about myself			0
i 've been taught things here			0
" she graduated in august , has her own apartment now and works to support herself and her son			0
some women arrive here voluntarily			2
others were sent by the state 's @entity113			0
others made a plea bargain with the courts , allowing them one last chance at treatment to avoid prison			2
" my biggest fear was the [ health of the ] baby , but right behind that was that ' i 'm going to go to jail ' , " says @entity120 , one of @entity24 ' classmates at @entity122			1
afraid of being turned in for her opiate addiction , she delayed getting prenatal care			2
" i should have gone in a lot sooner , " she admits			0
@entity120 , 37 , arrived at @entity122 after a hospital reported her drug use to law enforcement officials , as required by law			0
she has sandy blond hair and warm blue eyes that open up her leathered face			0
she cuddled her 8 - month - old son , @entity137 , when @entity2 visited the center in july			0
born with heroin in his system , @entity137 was placed on methadone			0
today , he is healthy , but studies show drug - exposed babies can face developmental delays and learning disabilities in later years			0
watch the women of @entity28 share their story Â» in 1997 , the @entity148 ruled that a fetus in the third trimester was viable and charges of child abuse , neglect and murder could apply to the mother			1
some treatment providers and advocacy experts say this ruling opened the door for prosecutors to charge pregnant women			1
" these are addicts who become pregnant , " says @entity162 , executive director of the @entity63 for @entity163			1
" they are n't women who chose to use drugs after becoming pregnant			1
" ' if i did n't have pills , i felt like i had nothing ' @entity24 's drug addiction started long before her pregnancy			1
she was born into a world of drugs			0
she says her mother was an addict , her father a violent alcoholic who once held a shotgun to her grandmother 's head			0
@entity24 's grandparents rescued her at age 3 by taking her into their home in rural @entity184 , @entity1			1
she has fond memories of her grandfather , but one morning , shortly after her 12th birthday , @entity24 watched her 54 - year - old grandfather die from a heart attack			1
the innocent girl started experimenting with drugs , partly because she could n't cope with her feelings , she says , but mostly to fit in			2
by the time she turned 18 , marijuana use gave way to cocaine and methamphetamine			0
then she discovered prescription painkillers : @entity199			0
" it was n't even about being high anymore			2
it was just being able to cope with everyday life , " @entity24 says			1
" if i did n't have the pills , i felt like i had nothing			2
" @entity24 could no longer leave bed without the painkillers			1
her routine consisted of melting @entity200 pills with water , placing the mixture into a syringe and shooting up , even during her pregnancy			0
by april of this year , she was six months pregnant and on probation for stealing jewelry to feed her drug habit			1
she took herself to @entity28			1
tucked alongside empty factories in a once - thriving textile district , the center looks more like a college dormitory inside than a sterile treatment center			2
homemade posters , photo collages and cards congratulating the women for giving birth are strewn along the hallways			2
there is a communal kitchen and colorful playgrounds			0
research shows women who remain with their children during treatment have better chances of defeating their addictions			1
but a national study in 2005 found that only 3 percent of treatment centers had programs tailored specifically to pregnant women			1
about 14 percent of treatment centers accepted pregnant or postpartum women			1
the women at @entity28 follow a rigid schedule that includes therapy , parenting classes and chores			1
they are n't allowed phone calls or the freedom to surf the internet without permission			2
security cameras guard all exits			0
the structure can be particularly hard for addicts who grew up in dysfunctional households with few rules			0
women spend on average six months in treatment			1
if a woman violates the rules , she can be removed from the program			0
on some occasions , women have walked out of the center , leaving their newborns behind			0
why prosecute ? why should addicted women be given a chance at motherhood ? what about the welfare of the children ? these are the questions asked by @entity1 prosecutors , known as solicitors general			1
several solicitors general contacted by @entity2 declined to comment on how many such cases they have prosecuted , but they say that charging pregnant women has become less common in the state			2
@entity280 , solicitor of @entity0 , says his district 's policy is a far cry from the 1990s , when then - @entity1 attorney general @entity284 , an anti-abortion advocate , publicly declared he would aggressively crack down on pregnant mothers accused of substance abuse			1
@entity284 often referred to a fetus as his " fellow @entity289			0
" despite several phone calls by @entity2 , @entity291 , who is now a private lawyer in @entity1 , could not be reached for comment			2
in his two decades as a @entity296 state representative , @entity295 of @entity297 , @entity1 , has pushed for more drug treatment funding , an effort he says has little chance in these tough economic times			1
" drug treatment ? " says @entity295			0
" @entity1 's response to addiction has been incarceration not treatment			1
" but @entity307 , manager of women 's services at @entity28 , knows treatment can be beneficial			1
she guides women like @entity24 and the others through that process			1
some who graduated from the program when it began in 1993 still remain clean			0
" what 's the other alternative if they do n't come here ? " says @entity307			0
that costs more than treatment , but a lot of people do n't know that			2
if these women do n't get this treatment , they are going to die			1
" a healthy baby , a new hope most of the women at @entity28 say they were little girls the first time they used drugs , some as young as 8			1
many could not recall what sobriety felt like until they came to the center			0

blond hair , pale skin like me , " @entity24 says			2
" i have her nose and lips			0
she just did n't respect herself			0
" @entity24 does n't want to be like her mother			1
her son , who was born july 24 , is healthy			0
