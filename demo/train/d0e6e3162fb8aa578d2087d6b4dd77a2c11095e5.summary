he is known as flight lieutenant @entity11 within the @entity89			0
@entity6 lives with her fiance at a house in @entity152 , giving them some privacy from the press and paparazzi , said @entity161 , a former editor of the @entity163 newspaper			2
the choice of 2011 as the year for the wedding makes sense , she said , because two major events are already scheduled for the following year			2
the @entity169 take place in @entity0 in 2012 , the same year the queen plans to celebrate her @entity171 , marking 60 years on the throne			0
" next year was always marked in as the year , " @entity161 said			0

bookmakers @entity187 on tuesday were offering 3 - 1 odds on august 13 , 2011 , being the wedding date , and 4 - 1 odds on august 6			2
it said saturday , july 30 , was less likely , at 10 - 1 odds , because it falls just a day after the 30th anniversary of the wedding of @entity8 and @entity9			1
the location for the wedding was also being kept secret , though @entity197 , a public relations consultant and royal commentator , told @entity2 he expects it to happen at @entity200 , probably in july			2
@entity4 and @entity6 broke up in april 2007 , despite widespread speculation even then that they were close to marriage			1
the split was said to be amicable , with the couple determined to remain friends , and the two appeared together in the royal box at @entity209 that july for the @entity210 , a charity event to remember @entity4 's mother 10 years after her death			1
the pair were seen together several more times that summer and were dating again by the end of the year			0
@entity6 's family is seen as upper - middle class			2
such a background bodes well for her future role at the side of the future king , according to @entity222 , who wrote a biography of princess @entity9			2
" the problem with recent royal brides who were aristocratic is that they thought they were doing the royal family a favor by marrying them , " she told @entity2 , " while the middle - class girls like @entity230 , the countess of @entity230 ( married to prince @entity8 ' brother , @entity232 ) , and @entity6 understand that to be royal requires some sacrifice , and they do not suffer from @entity235 [ delusion of greatness ] the way aristocratic girls evidently do nowadays			1
" @entity4 biographer @entity173 , however , said he feels the opposite about @entity6 , who he said lacks the " charisma " shown by @entity4 's mother			1
" remember that this young lady has no royal connections whatsoever , and that can be a danger , " he said			0
but journalist @entity161 said @entity4 chose his bride carefully			0
" i think the queen 's understood that it 's very important for @entity4 to make a happy marriage , " @entity161 told @entity2			2
" he watched his parents be unhappy , and the fact that they [ @entity4 and @entity6 ] have stayed together for so long and they have been together for so long rather proves that they get on very well			1
" @entity2 's @entity251 and @entity252 in @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity1 ; and @entity255 and @entity256 in @entity257 , @entity258 , contributed to this report .			0
