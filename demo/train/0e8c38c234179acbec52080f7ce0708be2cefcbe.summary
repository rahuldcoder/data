-- it should n't be a surprise			0
an image of a woman holding her own , looking smart and strong in the workplace , is more inspiring than a photograph of a stressed female executive struggling with a briefcase and a howling baby			0
but at a presentation wednesday at the @entity17 advertising festival in @entity18 , @entity20 coo and lean in founder @entity10 , and @entity12 co-founder and ceo @entity11 revealed what had spurred them to create the lean in collection , a curated selection of @entity12 imagery that shows women in a more diverse light - and revealed why it 's better for business			1
" we still live in a world - and this is a shocker , " @entity10 said wryly , " but it 's still overwhelmingly run by men			1
" less than six percent of ceos in any country , including the [ @entity35 ] , are women			2
" " there is huge cultural variety around the world , " @entity10 continued , " but the stereotypes of men and women are actually exactly the same			1
" men are told to lead , to be results focused			0
women are told they should speak when spoken to			2
little girls are called bossy , little boys are called leaders			0
" as human beings when something surprises us , or goes against our expectations , we dislike it			0
so if we show images of women leading , we actually change this			1
" @entity11 said , " there is nothing more powerful than an image that captures something in the moment ... that gets people to change their minds			1
" stepping away from stereotypical images showing women in passive or objectifying situations , the collection offers alternative representations of women doing physical jobs , working in robotics , aging gracefully and - @entity10 said emphatically - " not laughing eating salad			1
" the @entity72 in / @entity12 partnership , which launched in february , was greenlit by @entity10 when @entity12 's @entity75 and @entity77 's @entity76 presented @entity12 findings that suggested commercial clients were starting to look for a broader representation of women to use in their creative			1
@entity12 has seen sales of the images in the 2,500 - strong collection -- all of which were previously available -- jump by 54 %			1
" i wish we could see that pattern repeated across the entire @entity12 archive , " joked @entity11			1
@entity77 's push for a wider diversity of imagery in the media is part of a broader commercial trend towards a presentation of womanhood that 's more reflective of the lives of real women			1
@entity10 , who attributes this to the appeal of authentic user - generated content on social media , highlighted the groundbreaking example of @entity107 's " @entity113 " campaign , which celebrated a wide variety of female body types in addition to the lean silhouette traditionally favored by the media			1
she also pointed to more recent examples such as @entity116 's " @entity115 " viral hit , produced for @entity116 by @entity118 , @entity119 , that highlighted the different words ( " persuasive " vs " pushy , " " dedicated " vs " selfish " ) applied to high achieving men and women			2
campaigns such as these prove that a more representative approach that 's less perfect and more reflective of a diverse , global audience can gain significant social traction - nirvana to advertising executives seeking the holy grail of " earned social media " - industry jargon for trusted consumer word - of - mouth endorsement			2
the @entity134 advertisement 's 46 million views boosted brand favorability , especially in women aged 18 - 24 , and increased engagement with the brand by over four times , according to the agency			0
its follow - up , " not sorry , " which launched wednesday also , leverages the success of the popular # sorrynotsorry hashtag and questions why women feel the need to constantly apologize			0
it 's widely expected to repeat the success of its predecessor			0
@entity10 then challenged the audience of advertisers and agencies to reflect a more representative world in their creative , citing their potential reach			2
" bestselling books will sell two million copies , " she said			0
" the first @entity116 advert got 46 million views			0
[ the campaign will ] have reached 40 million people by the time the [ latest ] campaign is done			0
" we can show women with crying babies in briefcases or women hiding under their desks , or we can show women at their desks			0
