-- @entity2 is blocking access to @entity4 in response to an online group calling on people to draw the @entity8 , officials said wednesday			1
the @entity9 issued the order a day before " @entity11 , " scheduled by a @entity4 group with the same name , because of " the objectionable material " on the social networking site , said @entity16 of the telecommunication authority			1
" we have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time			0
we are just following the government 's instructions and the ruling of the @entity25			1
if the government decides to unblock it then that 's what we will do , " he said			1
the organization has not received any complaints from internet users about the blocking of @entity4 so far , he said			1
@entity35 @entity34 consider it offensive to depict @entity8			1
there were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of @entity8 in a @entity44 newspaper in 2005 , and at least two @entity46 cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the @entity51 prophet			1
@entity52 , who started the @entity4 group , said she read about the idea on a blog after @entity56 bleeped out part of an episode of " @entity59 " that mentioned the prophet			1
" this is meant to be in protest , " said @entity52 , who is @entity61			2
" this is something i have felt strongly about for a long time : bullying by certain @entity51 groups will not be tolerated in a free country			1
" @entity52 said @entity2 's decision to block @entity4 was ridiculous			1
her group and a similar one had attracted about 7,000 fans between them wednesday			0
groups opposing the idea had about 68,000			2
a spokesman for the @entity75 said the idea behind the group was offensive			2
" @entity51 discourages any visual representations of the prophets of @entity80 -- @entity83 , @entity82 , @entity8 , anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship , " @entity81 said			1
" the majority of @entity34 worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of @entity80			2
" the idea of " @entity11 " originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea , @entity52 and @entity81 said			1
" the whole campaign has been taken up by muslim - bashers and @entity96 , " @entity81 said			0
" this extends beyond being able to draw @entity8 , " she said			2
" if it 's offensive to you , that 's fine , but i do n't feel it 's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation			2
" this is nothing to do with hate or bigotry , " she said			0
" nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals			0
" @entity52 said she is not a muslim but added that she had received " hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me			0
" one group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised			0
" this is a hot - topic debate , but so is abortion , illegal immigrants , gay marriage and politics			0
if we allow even a small compromise for one group , then the free speech on topics like abortion , illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate , " @entity128 said on @entity0 's @entity129			0
" hate speech is wanting a group eradicated , physically harmed or dead			0
i do n't think drawing @entity8 falls under that category , " she said			0
" @entity51 is not above criticism or cartoons			0
i believe in equality , and censoring @entity8 while we can draw every other figure in the world does not equal equality , " she said			0
@entity4 is investigating the block , said @entity152 , the company 's director of global communications			1
@entity0 's @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
