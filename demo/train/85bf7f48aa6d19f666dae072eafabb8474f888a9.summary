-- @entity1 wants his listeners to know that he is " a close high " to @entity4			1
his latest album , " @entity6 , " released tuesday , offered several controversial track titles , including " new slaves , " " @entity9 " and the most audacious , " i am a @entity4			1
" the track 's credit says " featuring @entity4 , " as if he 's just another artist -- a @entity12 or @entity13 -- stepping into the studio to spit a couple of verses			1
the song closes with the verses , " i just talked to @entity19 / he said , ' what up , @entity6 ? ' / i said " s * * * i 'm chilling / trying to stack these millions ' / i know he 's the most high , but i am a close high			1
" review : ' @entity6 ' is @entity1 's darkest , most extreme album yet so , does @entity1 really think he 's @entity4 's match ? some say the outspoken @entity26 is downright delusional , but @entity27 , author of " @entity28 , " thinks otherwise			1
the rap star 's god - absorbed lyrics are a referral to his high status in the music industry , not a statement of religious beliefs , said @entity27 , an assistant professor of religious studies at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			1
" i do n't think ( this christian theological language ) is creating a religion , " she said			0
" he 's using @entity4 to situate himself at the top of the game			2
" but pastor c. @entity46 of @entity48 , @entity50 's @entity49 , believes @entity1 has been wrong from the get - go			1
religious people " should want to be like @entity19 ( in a humble way ) , follow @entity52 , but any reference to equality means that you are wrong from the very beginning			0
" the beginning before the world knew @entity1 as an egotistical rapper , he was under the radar as a music engineer making beats for chart - topping artists such as @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 was brought into the spotlight after producing several tracks for @entity71 's classic hip - hop album " @entity72			1
" his first album , " the @entity73 , " dropped in february 2004 , debuting at no. 2 on the @entity76 @entity75 chart			2
it was met with immediate acclaim , with some critics suggesting that it was the best debut album ever released by a hip - hop artist			2
" @entity87 " was the album 's third single and the world 's introduction to @entity26 's religious beliefs			1
the song received praise from critics for its open conversation of faith in the secular rap community			0
the gospel - choir hook of " @entity19 walks " flows over lyrics like , " @entity4 , show me the way because the devil trying to break me down			2
... the only thing that i pray is that my feet do n't fail me now			0
... and i do n't think there is nothing i can do now to right my wrongs			0
... i want to talk to @entity4 , but i 'm afraid because we ai n't spoke in so long			0
" @entity1 : ' people look at me like i 'm @entity106 ' the fallen angel @entity1 could be forgiven for feeling touched to even be in a position to drop a record after a near - fatal head - on car collision required him to undergo facial reconstruction surgery and have his jaw wired shut			1
in interviews after the accident , @entity1 credited @entity4 with his survival			1
within two weeks , he was back in the studio -- jaw still wired -- recording his groundbreaking hit , " @entity123 , " which included the lyric " thank @entity4 i ai n't too cool for the safe belt			0
" gaining fame and notoriety seemed to spark @entity1 's candor -- and cockiness			1
the following year , the rapper ran into his first bout of controversy during a @entity132 telethon where he uttered the infamous phrase , " @entity134 does n't care about black people			0
" he 'd go on to pose on a 2006 @entity137 cover as -- you guessed it -- @entity19 alongside the headline " @entity141 of @entity1			2
" he wore a tunic and crown of thorns in the cover photo			0
his life changed further in 2007 , when his mother , @entity147 , to whom he devoted so many songs and so much of his success , died of heart failure after cosmetic surgery			0
@entity1 's behavior grew increasingly bizarre , from engaging in beefs with photographers to storming out of awards shows when he did n't win , and culminated in an incident at the 2009 @entity157 when he famously interrupted @entity158 during an acceptance speech for @entity160			1
like many talented artists , @entity1 said he was funneling his pain into his music , and despite the various styles he 's adopted over the past nine years , religion has been a consistent topic in his personal and professional life			1
see also : @entity1 is having a devil of a time convincing critics that he 's not a @entity171 worshiper			1
@entity1 : @entity19 - like ego or showmanship ? @entity1 , who was raised in a @entity175 home , is no stranger to citing his relationship with @entity4 in his songs			1
in addition to " @entity87 , " songs such as " @entity179 " and " @entity180 " give insight into ' @entity1 's self - proclaimed " @entity19 - like " persona			1
in his personal life , @entity1 has said he adamantly believes in providence			2
" i 'm on a path that @entity4 puts me on			0
i do n't believe that all of this happened by chance , " he told @entity187 in 2009			0
" i just think @entity4 has put me in a really good space			0
and i think he has a mission for me			0
there 's gon na be ups and downs			2
but it 's something that he wants me to deliver to the world			2
" he added , " i believe in @entity4 , but i do n't buy into any particular , specific religion			0
so maybe i 'm nondenominational or whatever			0
i do n't know what the definition of it is			0
i just believe in @entity4			0
i would never say that it 's in @entity19 ' hands			2
" sounds like a contradiction coming from a man who nicknamed himself @entity6 , but at what point is he dishonoring religion by claiming to be a deity ? have you heard : ' @entity210 ' named their baby what ?			1

@entity1 's new album , " @entity6 , " has several controversial track titles
that includes the audacious " @entity218 "
his lyrics have raised debate over whether he thinks he 's a deity
