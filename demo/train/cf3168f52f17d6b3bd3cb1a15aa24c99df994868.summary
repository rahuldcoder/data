@entity0 , @entity1 -- tucked between snow - topped mountains , @entity1 's @entity0 is home to dozens of ramshackle camps housing @entity7 refugees who have little to protect them against the cold			1
it was the image of children with no shoes in the bitter winter and mud that @entity13 , a designer and mother of three , could n't get out of her mind over the past year			1
" it was the first thing ... the only thing that stayed in my head , " she says			2
this year , she decided to do something about it			2
she was in the process of organizing her campaign , procuring winter boots for children , when @entity1 was hit by one of its coldest spells and harshest storms in memory			1
that 's when @entity13 realized she was n't the only one who felt compelled to do something			1
" everybody was so angry , angry at the government , angry at the silence , " she says			0
" everybody was thinking of the refugees			0
and seeing that anger -- and i myself worried and angry -- i launched it			0
" she started a @entity43 campaign , " @entity44 for @entity7 refugee children , " with a target of 2,000 pairs of boots			1
she achieved her goal within the first 24 hours , ending up with thousands more pairs			1
and the boots keep coming			2
" it 's like really seeing , realizing that there is still humanity on earth , especially in this part of the world , " @entity13 says			1
helping to organize the distribution is @entity61 , a nongovernmental organization started over coffee with friends by @entity64 , a 25 - year - old @entity1 @entity7			1
a ph.d. candidate living in @entity66 , @entity64 came back to @entity1 two years ago for a visit and just could n't leave			1
" the number of refugees has reached a ceiling of 2 million in @entity1 with a complete chaos in ngos , a complete lack of institutional coordination			1
so grass - roots organizations like us and many other initiatives are taking the lead to try and do something , but still the need is very very high			0
" sawa for @entity7 now has some 2,000 members , all volunteers , and helps manage and distribute aid to camps across the @entity0			1
among those waiting for their boots on this day is a group of friends that clamors around us			2
@entity90 , 9 , shows off how she can write her name in @entity92			0
the other girls chatter about wanting to go back home to @entity7			1
but @entity95 , a 5 - year - old with large brown eyes , stays silent as she slips her hand into mine , clutching it tightly			0
the older boys tell us her father is dead , killed by a sniper in @entity103 as he was riding a minibus			0
one of her brothers is missing in @entity7 , presumed detained by regime forces ; another is still recovering from injuries after an artillery strike			1
we wade through the sticky mud to her family tent			0
she and her sisters show us where they shoved cardboard into the makeshift ceiling to absorb the rainwater			0
@entity119 , @entity95 's 13 - year - old sister , has n't been able to register in school			0
over the summer she and one of her brothers worked in the fields			0
without a father , it 's the children 's burden to help make ends meet			2
as we chat their mother arrives , her face etched with pain , eyes weary			0
" my eldest , her husband died recently too			0
they had three kids , " she says , her heart so broken she seems numb to it all			0
as for so many other @entity7 , hardship and pain are the norm			1
in another world , @entity119 says , she would have continued her education -- she wants to be a journalist			2
one of her younger sisters wants to be a dentist , and @entity95 says she wants to be a doctor			0
but these children know the harsh reality of life too well			1
at least while they are getting fitted for their boots and showing us what they ended up with , there are those brief smiles and giggles			2
" sometimes you feel like no matter what you do , you are just doing 1 % of the need , " @entity64 says			0
" but at the same time when you see a child smiling , a mother happy that her son got something , those moments do count			0
" as @entity13 says one of her friends put it : " it 's like giving them a @entity174 moment			1
it 's true -- seeing the happiness on the children 's faces , with dignity , they were all so proud and dignified			2

@entity7 children in refugee camps in @entity1 lack *basics* to get through harsh winters
@entity13 organized a @entity43 campaign to get rain boots for children
within 24 hours she had thousands of pairs of boots , and more keep arriving
" there is still humanity on earth , especially in this part of the world , " @entity13 says
