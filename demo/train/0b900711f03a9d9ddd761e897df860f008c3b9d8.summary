everybody knows the @entity1 is basically an all - white bastion , right ? after all , even @entity3 condemned the " dark vein of intolerance " that has flowed through his party since the post-civil rights era political realignment			1
now with president @entity10 leading the @entity11 into a second term -- buoyed by overwhelming victory margins among african - americans and @entity15 -- it 's clear the @entity1 has some serious catching up to do			1
this is why it might surprise you to hear that @entity1 are by far the more diverse party when it comes to statewide elected officials such as senators and governors			1
on this front , they leave democrats in the dust			0
and that 's why the @entity1 actually has a greater depth of diversity on their potential presidential bench looking to 2016 and beyond			1
it 's counterintuitive but true			0
let 's start with a look at the governors , the traditional launching pad of presidential ambitions			0
among the @entity1 ranks is @entity40 , the @entity15 governor of @entity41			1
the 49 - year - old former federal judge took on a corrupt conservative incumbent and is now racking up an impressive reform record in his first term			0
likewise , there is @entity48 's gov. @entity47 , a former district attorney who remains popular in her state despite an otherwise @entity11 tide			2
how many @entity15 governors do the @entity11 have in office ? zero			1
attracting minority voters a key @entity1 goal @entity56 's @entity57 - @entity56 population is fast - growing and successful			1
@entity59 gov. @entity58 is one of the nation 's most innovative governors , and the former @entity63 scholar is newly committed to making the @entity1 no longer " the party of stupid			1
" if he chooses to run for president in 2016 , @entity58 could make a major dent in the race and possibly emerge toward the front of the pack			0
there is also @entity72 gov. @entity71 , who climbed from the @entity73 to the @entity74 , breaking a number of historical barriers along the way			0
in the past two months , she has appointed the first @entity78 - @entity56 @entity1 from the @entity72 to the @entity79 since @entity81 ( @entity80 ) , and her husband was deployed to @entity83			2
how many @entity57 - @entity56 governors do @entity11 have in office ? none			1
now let 's move over the @entity79			0
the aforementioned @entity80 just was tapped by @entity71 to finish out sen. @entity89 's term , making the former congressman the first @entity78 - @entity56 @entity1 senator serving since @entity92 of @entity93 in the 1970s			2
he is also the only black senator of either party			2
likewise , the @entity1 is looking at two young new @entity15 stars in the @entity79 chamber -- @entity98 's @entity97 and the newly elected @entity99 from @entity100			1
interestingly , both men are of @entity103 descent			0
presidential buzz surrounded @entity97 almost from the moment he entered office after defeating the sitting governor , @entity107 , in a contentious primary			0
he has put forward an innovative immigration reform proposal in recent weeks , which could help shape national debate , and he 's already decamped to @entity112 to speak at a political dinner			0
@entity99 is a former member of the @entity114 who donned the @entity116 mantle to defeat a powerful sitting lieutenant governor in a primary			0
he was born in @entity119 to an @entity56 mother , a fact that has n't stopped the fast - forward presidential projection			0
at the very least , @entity99 will be a real force in the @entity79 for decades to come			0
on the @entity11 side , the only @entity15 senator is @entity127 's @entity126			1
while in line for the chairmanship of the @entity130 , he has been beset by ethical allegations for much of his career , most recently the accusation that federal agents held off from arresting an office intern who was also an undocumented immigrant and registered sex offender until after @entity126 's re-election			0
( @entity126 has said he did n't know about any possible delay			0
) @entity126 might have influence , but he is not a charismatic figure			0
that 's why the @entity142 chose to highlight @entity144 mayor @entity143 at its keynote , rather than anyone more senior or nationally known			0
@entity147 : at convention , @entity1 leaders reflect @entity56 diversity the @entity1 ' surprising diversity edge when it comes to statewide elected officials can not erase the very real diversity deficit they face below this level			1
in the @entity157 , often called " @entity159 , " the disparity is stark			2
the new 113th @entity160 is the most diverse in history , but that diversity comes almost exclusively courtesy of the @entity11 side of the aisle			1
for example , there are 42 @entity167 -- all are @entity11			2
the @entity15 population is comparatively less skewed , with 27 congressional @entity11 and eight @entity1			1
among @entity171 , we 're back to the lopsided totals -- 11 @entity11 and no @entity1			1
it is a historical irony and a barely slumbering scandal that the party of @entity176 lost its edge on diversity in pursuit of short - term political gain by realigning the @entity182 states of the former @entity183 in the wake of the @entity186 bills that conservatives such as @entity188 believed were unconstitutional			1
the times when @entity191 's father , like millions of other african - americans , was automatically a @entity1 are a distant memory			2
but @entity11 should not rest on their laurels after @entity10			2
their lack of statewide - elected diverse @entity11 is striking and could provide an opening for @entity1 in the next generation ( if conservatives do n't keep alienating that community with anti-immigrant rhetoric and legislation )			1
the old stereotypes do n't hold when looking at the facts -- republicans have been quietly making inroads into communities of color , even if that has n't yet registered in overall voting patterns			0
and rising @entity1 stars such as @entity97 , @entity58 , @entity40 , @entity80 , @entity71 , @entity99 and @entity47 are reasons for optimism as we look toward the future of @entity56 politics .			2

@entity217 : @entity1 senators , governors more diverse than @entity11
he says party has the edge in diversity among higher - ranking offices
@entity217 says @entity1 has *trouble* attracting black , @entity15 voters
he adds that among members of @entity157 , @entity1 diversity *sorely* lacking
