-- @entity1 survived another emotional roller coaster to claim her place in the women 's singles final at @entity6 with a thrilling three - set victory over fourth seed @entity8 thursday			1
the 23rd seed from @entity11 will play @entity12 of @entity13 saturday , the winners progressing to the title match by vastly contrasting routes			1
15th seed @entity12 took little over an hour to end the dream run of @entity20 @entity19 6 - 1 6 - 2 in the first semifinal			1
@entity1 , who caused the upset of all upsets when she dispatched defending champion @entity24 on monday , was again taken the full distance by @entity8 before winning 4 - 6 2 - 6 9 - 7 in two hours 18 minutes of compelling action on @entity27			1
like in her match against @entity29 , @entity1 trailed by a break in the decider and looked to be heading for the exit door until summoning up a stirring comeback			0
" in the third set i was down 3 - 0 and i thought ' i did it against @entity24 , i can do it again , " she told @entity34			0
" it was unbelievable , i think the last few games were so exciting			0
it was a battle and i 'm just so happy to have won it , " she added			0
@entity8 , beaten by @entity24 in last year 's final , appeared to have taken a stranglehold on the match when she recovered from an early break down in the second set to win eight of the next nine games			1
but the 23 - year - old @entity1 , who has become an instant crowd favorite at @entity48 , battled back to serve for the match at 5 - 4 , only to be broken again			2
@entity8 kept on the pressure to force @entity1 to hold her own service twice to stay in the championship but in the 15th game fell behind again			1
serving for a place in the final for the second time , @entity1 held her nerve and took it on her second match point before falling to the turf in trademark celebration			2
@entity12 , who revealed after her victory that she had taken a half hour nap shortly before coming out for one of the most important matches of her career , emerged from her slumbers to dismiss 20th seed @entity19			1
looking to follow in the footsteps of famous compatriots such as @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity19 looked nervous and tentative from the start and could not repeat the form which had seen her knock out 2011 @entity6 champion @entity73			2
" i was asleep from 12 until 1230 , you can ask the physio , " @entity12 said			0
" and i was still razor - sharp right from the start			0
" she put out @entity70 in the 2007 semifinals before going on to lose in straight sets to @entity79 and will be looking to go one better against @entity1 , who is appearing in her first grand slam final			2
@entity1 will bid to become the first @entity11 to win a major since @entity82 in the @entity83			0
