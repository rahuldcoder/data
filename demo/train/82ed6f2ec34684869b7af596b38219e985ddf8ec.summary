@entity1 , @entity0 -- our government is utterly broke			0
there are signs everywhere one looks			0
@entity7 can no longer afford to send us our annual benefit statements			0
the @entity9 can no longer afford its congressional pages			0
the @entity11 can no longer afford the pension and health care benefits of retired service members			0
@entity15 is no longer planning a manned mission to @entity17			0
we 're broke for a reason			0
we 've spent six decades accumulating a huge official debt ( @entity21 bills and bonds ) and vastly larger unofficial debts to pay for @entity7 , @entity24 , and medicaid benefits to today 's and tomorrow 's 100 million - plus retirees			1
the government 's total indebtedness -- its fiscal gap -- now stands at $ 211 trillion , by my arithmetic			1
the fiscal gap is the difference , measured in present value , between all projected future spending obligations -- including our huge defense expenditures and massive entitlement programs , as well as making interest and principal payments on the official debt -- and all projected future taxes			1
the data underlying this figure come straight from the horse 's mouth -- the @entity46			1
the @entity46 's june 22 @entity47 presents nothing less than a @entity50 tragedy			1
it 's actually worse than the @entity50 tragedy now playing in @entity53			1
our fiscal gap is 14 times our gdp			1
@entity50 's fiscal gap is 12 times its gdp , according to professor @entity58 of the @entity59			1
in other words , the @entity60 is in worse long - term fiscal shape than @entity50			1
the financial sharks are circling @entity50 because @entity50 is small and defenseless , but they 'll soon be swimming our way			1
to grasp the magnitude of our nation 's insolvency , consider what tax hikes or spending cuts are needed to eliminate our fiscal gap			1
the answer is an immediate and permanent 64 % increase in all federal revenues or an immediate and permanent 40 % cut in all federal noninterest spending			0
such adjustments go miles beyond anything @entity78 and the president are considering			0
they are focused on limiting growth in the official debt , while ignoring what 's happening to the unofficial debt			1
to understand the thickness of their blinders , note that the fiscal gap , after inflation , grew by $ 6 trillion last year , whereas the official debt grew by only $ 1 trillion			1
hence , our leaders are looking at one - sixth of the problem			1
the august budget ceiling crisis deal calls for $ 2.5 trillion in budgetary savings over the next ten years			0
president @entity96 is unveiling plans monday to cut the debt by $ 3 trillion			1
both of these are peanuts compared to what 's needed to start eliminating the fiscal gap			1
there is a way forward to deal with both our fiscal mess and the economy , which is lying on the operating table in desperate need of open - heart surgery			1
such surgeries are called radical because they require radical intervention			1
but they are also extremely safe compared with the alternative -- administering @entity116 and letting the patient die			0
at www.thepurpleplans.org , i provide five radical , but absolutely essential plans to fix taxes , health care , @entity7 , the financial system , and energy policy			1
collectively , they would more than eliminate the fiscal gap and get our economy out of the emergency room and onto the racetrack			1
the plans are called purple because they should appeal to blue @entity133 and red @entity134			0
if neither party adopts them , i guarantee that a third - party candidate running via www.americanselect.org will			0
the @entity139 is of particular relevance now , given @entity96 's decision to push for a repeal of the @entity144 tax cuts for the rich and to levy a new tax on the super rich -- those with incomes above $ 1 million			1
the president wants to raise taxes			0
ca n't argue with that			0
we desperately need much higher revenues along with much lower expenditures			0
federal revenues measured as share of gdp are at a postwar low			2
and the president wants the rich to bear a bigger share of the tax burden			2
it 's hard to disagree with this either			2
the rich have been getting off far too easy for far too long			0
but the @entity134 want to ensure that more taxes do n't mean more spending or smaller spending cuts than would otherwise arise			0
they also worry about high tax rates discouraging work , saving , and job creation by entrepreneurs			2
most of us agree with both the president and the @entity134 , which is possible because they 're both talking past each other			0
but what we really want is a tax system that 's simple , transparent , fair , and efficient			1
neither the personal income tax , the corporate income tax , nor the estate and gift tax meet these criteria			2
each is a bigger nightmare than the next			0
the @entity139 entails radical surgery			2
it eliminates the personal income tax , the corporate income tax , and the estate and gift tax			2
in their place it substitutes a highly progressive 17.5 % federal retail sales tax plus a demogrant -- a monthly payment to each household , large enough that it reimburses the poor for the sales tax they 've paid			2
( the 17.5 % rate is the tax 's nominal rate			1
its effective rate is 15 % , since 15 cents of every dollar spent goes to taxes and 85 cents to goods and services , with 15 divided by 85 equaling the 17.5 % nominal rate			0
) if you 're a @entity208 , a sales tax , apart from the demogrant , probably sounds highly regressive			2
but nothing could be further from the truth			0
taxing consumption is mathematically identical to taxing what 's used to buy consumption , namely one 's wealth and one 's wages			2
@entity220 would effectively pay 15 % on his wages , but also 15 % on the principal of all his wealth , which is not now being taxed			0
the day the @entity139 is implemented , @entity220 will have the same number of dollars in wealth , but the purchasing power of his wealth will fall by 15 % , thanks to the 17.5 % higher costs of goods and services			0
and whether he spends his wealth on himself or gives it to his kids to spend , his wealth , plus any accumulated asset income , will buy 15 % less in goods and services			0
the @entity139 also makes the payroll tax highly progressive by eliminating its ceiling and exempting the first $ 40,000 in wages from the employee portion of the tax			2
finally , the @entity139 includes a 15 % inheritance tax on inheritances and gifts received in excess of $ 1 million			2
since the payroll tax is levied at close to a 15 % rate , and the sales tax has an effective rate of 15 % , and the inheritance tax rate is 15 % , the @entity139 plan imposes a single tax rate			1
this is very important for budgetary discipline			0
under the @entity139 , everyone will know that if @entity78 spends more on anything , the 15 % effective tax rate will need to go up			2
the ongoing food fight between @entity96 and the @entity134 is hiding the real game -- spending ever - larger sums on ourselves and leaving ever - larger bills for our kids			1
this fiscal child abuse must stop			2
the purple plans would let both sides claim victory , save our kids , and get our economy back in the race			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			1

@entity270 : @entity60 's real fiscal gap is *enormous*
he says gap is 14 times gdp , worse than that of @entity50
@entity96 's debt *reduction* plan is too small to cure problem , he says
@entity270 : @entity60 needs radical tax *reform* to turn around economy
