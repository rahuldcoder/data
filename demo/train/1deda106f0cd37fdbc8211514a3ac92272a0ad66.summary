-- @entity1 learned about artificial intelligence during a seventh - grade school project			1
she was immediately enthralled , bought a book on programming and taught herself how to code			0
now 17 , @entity1 won the grand prize at the second annual @entity7 on monday for her project on improving breast cancer diagnosis accuracy using artificial neural networks			1
that combination of drive , passion for science and a desire to do something good was common at this year 's event			2
organizers of the online science fair received thousands of entries from 100 countries , including @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity7 picked 15 finalists and , at a final gala in an airplane hangar in @entity29 , announced the winners in three age categories , along with a grand - prize winner			1
@entity33 , 14 , won first place in his age group for a project that helps people with hearing loss experience music through vibrations			2
a team of three 15 - and 16 - year - olds from @entity42 took home a trophy ( made entirely out of @entity45 ) for their look at the microscopic creatures that thrive in fresh water			2
two 15 - year - old young men from @entity25 researched hydroponic techniques to help subsistence farmers in their homeland , where food shortages are a devastating problem			2
they won the @entity56 award , which highlighted a project making a practical difference			2
before the winners were announced , the finalists presented their projects one last time on the @entity7 campus monday afternoon			1
groups of young kids from summer camps filed through to meet the young scientists and watch their demonstrations			0
some @entity7 employees even brought their children to work for the day just to see the event			1
in classic @entity73 fashion , many adults were there grilling presenters , just like they would any entrepreneur with a pitch			0
they asked tough questions about methodology , costs and results			0
some even asked about business plans			0
one man urged finalist @entity83 to make his eco-friendly toilet design , the @entity85 - flush , open source			2
@entity83 's prototype uses a vacuum system that consumes 50 % less water than traditional toilets			0
unfortunately , his design is still too cost - prohibitive to be made made without the help of established toilet manufacturers			0
" they would need to take me seriously , which they wo n't because i 'm 16 years old , " he said			0
the contest was free to enter and open to all students around the world between 13 and 18 years of age			1

the grand prize winner receives a $ 50,000 scholarship , an internship and a trip to the @entity107			1
for @entity1 , one of the highlights of the experience was meeting famed computer scientist @entity111 , who talked with her at length about computer science and neural networks			0
for her winning project , @entity1 wrote a program that improves diagnoses of malignant breast tumors by using a large amount of data stored online and looking for patterns			1
it 's an ambitious project that was made possible by that first spark of interest in programming five years ago " i decided that it was what i was going to do , " said the @entity126 native			0
" i 'm very persistent , and i learned to code , and i started coding neural networks that played soccer -- i 'm an avid soccer player as well			0
