-- last month 's assault and massacre at the @entity4 gas plant in @entity5 by an @entity7 battalion led by @entity8 put into sharp focus the growing threat of @entity12 jihadists in north and @entity14			1
it also brought back vivid memories of my own 130 - day kidnap ordeal also at the hands of @entity21 's @entity7 group in @entity22 and @entity23 in 2008/09			1
here is an extract from my book ... a season in @entity28 torture with some ceremony , a dvd was produced and inserted into the laptop drive and we were maneuvered around to have pride of place in front of the screen			1
the others pressed around , the younger ones in front			1
there were three or four pre-pubescent boys among them , their faces rapt with anticipation as their screen - lit faces excitedly tried to watch us and the laptop simultaneously			1
' mr. @entity48 ' : the veteran jihadist behind the attack in @entity5 soon we heard a loud pulsing , urgent , musical beat and the screen was filled with a black flag , the lower half of which was covered with white @entity59 script and in the upper portion , there was a globe surmounted by an @entity64 assault rifle ; the @entity7 banner			1
using the traditional and mandatory @entity68 opening , a voice intoned in @entity59 , " in the name of @entity74 the most merciful ... " and the centre of the screen began to fill with images and vignettes of all kinds of horrors : those aircraft slamming into the twin towers			1
@entity80 and allied vehicles being destroyed in @entity81 and @entity82 by @entity83 ( @entity83 ) ; video cameras slaved to the sights of @entity87 sniper rifles blasting the heads off @entity89 and then murdering those who came to their assistance ; suicide bombers driving explosive - laden trucks through fences and into buildings or crowds immediately followed by massive explosions			1
sometimes such scenes would carry sub-titles giving the date and location of the horror			1
in other instances , there would be clips of the happy , excited suicide bomber explaining his joy at the prospect of martyring himself for such a noble purpose			2
power struggle : the @entity112 gas industry targeted by militants there would also be clips of their " @entity116 " , @entity118 , uttering in his quiet and reasonable sounding voice his latest threats to tear the heart out of the degenerate west			2
then some stocky , heavily bearded , white robed and turbaned @entity80 , who we were told was @entity126 , a @entity128 @entity127 convert to @entity68 and @entity7 , made his first of many appearances			1
@entity126 was ridiculing -- in @entity130 , with @entity59 sub-titles -- the @entity80 president and issuing dire warnings aimed at @entity80 audiences of the disasters that would befall @entity80 if the @entity80 and her allies did not quit " muslim lands "			2
read more : @entity5 crisis is a wakeup call for @entity80 while @entity118 was lionized by the young men around us , the star of each show was the brash , in - our - face ( and happily defunct ) @entity144 , a @entity145 who was the former leader of the @entity81 franchise of @entity7			1
@entity144 had walked their talk regarding cleansing " muslim lands " of the presence of infidels with passion , utter ruthlessness and without compromise			2
he was their man of action			2
he did , in their view , what others merely talked and fantasized about			2
the scene the young ones loved best on what we came to call " @entity164 " , was @entity166 standing , legs planted wide , with a fierce and vicious open - mouthed grin on his face , firing the entire 100 round magazine of a @entity172 ( a @entity174 light machinegun ) , just past the camera with the sound jacked way up			2
we could almost hear his scream of whatever the @entity59 equivalent is of " @entity179 ! " read more : @entity5 hostage crisis may be future of terrorism each time an episode of mayhem and destruction would occur on the screen , the crowd pressing around @entity184 and me would shout , " @entity193 " and immediately swivel their eyes to watch how we were enjoying the show			1
without my glasses , i could read none of the signs or sub-titles , so @entity184 would read them out loud until i quietly asked him to stop			2
the video did not need a great deal of interpretation			2
obviously , these propaganda videos were intended to pump up the boys , to remind them that they were part of a large global cause in which sacrifice was a major element			2
and it was having the desired impact ; particularly for the younger mujahideen whose eyes glistened with excitement as they watched the @entity216 infidels being butchered and humiliated over and over again			0
the senior members of the @entity218 were less caught up in the show and the laptop operator was choosing the clips to be displayed with some care			0
i could only imagine what he was skipping and i did not for a moment presume that they were being avoided out of generosity but rather cold , hard pragmatism			0
they did not want to break their hostages , at least , not yet			0
in many ways , both for the assembled @entity218 of @entity233 , and for me , the scenes that elicited the strongest emotion were the all - too - familiar images of black - hooded , orange - clad figures , chained hand and foot , shuffling around those tiny cages in @entity241			0
these were indignities perpetrated by my side -- the ' good guys '			0
those scenes of @entity248 , fangs bared , straining to get at broken men cowering in corners and those piles of horrified naked bodies forced into obscene intimacy and , always , the iconic black - hooded figure , mutely perched barefoot on a box in a short black poncho with wires dangling from his outstretched fingers in the disgraceful @entity259 in @entity260 , made me , in the midst of my own mental anguish , feel deep shame			0
the leaden and menacing stares of our @entity7 captors eloquently made a mockery of our aggressive @entity216 claims to harbour higher or superior values			1
the look on their faces declared that we had abandoned any alleged moral high - ground , which they , at least for the moment , sought to occupy with regard to their treatment of @entity184 and me , if only to demonstrate to themselves their own moral superiority			0
it is therefore at least paradoxical that those wretched videotapes and photos of @entity241 and @entity259 may have resulted in @entity184 ' and my captivity being less violent than it otherwise might have been , for it seemed to me that we were spared worse treatment because our abductors were anxious to demonstrate that they did n't stoop to such stuff , which , of course , we know is not generally the case			0
that particular myth , however , with that particular group of @entity233 hostage - takers , probably served us well			1
thus , i found that the most appalling of those tv night videos images were not the mass murders and individual assassinations perpetrated by @entity7 and their allies against our soldiers and civilians , which were never easy to behold , but less difficult to understand			1
that was simply @entity7 being @entity7			1
that was what they were			0
rather , it was the intimate and almost palpable proof of our side 's methodically applied , officially sanctioned , and so casually administered barbarity , that had been parsed into the bureaucratic banalities and legal niceties of officially sanctioned abuse and torture which was so hard to absorb			0
viewing such scenes , i could not help but believe that if we were capable of such outrages and so carelessly willing to resort to torture - as - entertainment , then we had indeed strayed into truly dangerous ethical territory			0
the ease with which faux - legal language was coined in @entity320 and unopposed throughout the @entity321 in a cursory attempt to legitimize the illegitimate ; the arbitrary manner in which long - standing international conventions were set aside ; and the glibness with which word - games and were employed to condone such practices , should have stunned us all			0
the methodical development of " black sites " and concepts like " extraordinary rendition " ( sub-contracting torture ) and " enhanced interrogation " ; the invention of ersatz juridical explanations of why was not torture , and other such despicable behaviour , indeed made a mockery of our @entity216 pretensions to be champions of human rights and international justice			0
further , without a shred of doubt , they have massively increased recruitment to the @entity12 cause and markedly amplified the threat against @entity216 interests and the security of individual @entity80 and their friends and allies			1
if the dreadful events of 11 september 2001 could so easily dismantle the bulwarks of free , just and open societies which had taken us centuries to build , then , yes , our claims to a higher moral standard were in fact a sham , and surely there were no effective limits to what we were prepared to visit upon our enemies , or merely anybody who got in our way			0
no , these were not made - in - @entity371 practices , justifications and facilities , but how easily we in our country and our friends throughout @entity376 abandoned our much - vaunted principles and meekly , often enthusiastically , went along			0
the bulk of our usually vocal human rights advocates and politicians were muted or stunned into silence when the need to avenge the insult and atrocity of 9/11 was allowed to pervert the law and sully the reputation of our friends and neighbours ; perversions which have done and continue to do the @entity321 incalculable harm throughout the world			0
we are clearly guilty by such association			0
and @entity184 and i were reaping the consequences			0
