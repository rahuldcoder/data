-- the @entity5 government is working constructively with the international team overseeing the destruction of the nation 's chemical weapons , the chief of the world 's chemical weapons watchdog said wednesday			1
inspectors visited a first site earlier this week , where they saw some chemical weapons equipment destroyed , and are expected to visit more than 20 others over the coming days , said @entity14 , director - general of the @entity15			1
" the cooperation has been quite constructive , and i will say that the @entity5 authorities have been cooperative , " @entity14 told reporters at the @entity17 on wednesday			1
@entity5 : chemical weapons team faces many dangers , says @entity23 chief @entity22 his account comes less than two months after an august 21 chemical attack outside @entity26 that led to @entity27 and allied calls for military intervention in @entity5 's civil war -- a confrontation that was defused in mid-september , when @entity26 agreed to a @entity27 - @entity33 plan to give up its chemical weapons stockpile			1
a @entity36 resolution gives @entity5 until mid- 2014 to destroy that arsenal , which the @entity27 estimated at about 1,000 tons of blister agents and nerve gas			2
the @entity5 provided an initial declaration of its stockpile and must submit a plan for destroying the weapons by october 27 , @entity14 said			1
inspectors must complete their initial inspections of all @entity5 chemical weapons and storage facilities by november 1 and complete the eradication of production and chemical mixing facilities , the @entity23 resolution states			1
@entity14 said inspectors visited a second site wednesday			2
@entity5 's @entity54 says he welcomes return of @entity23 inspectors inspectors face risks in ' dangerous and volatile ' @entity5 the timeline is tight and the inspectors face significant challenges , including having to cross front lines and move through areas controlled by militants fighting @entity5 's government			2
@entity14 hinted that if the deadlines are to be met , cooperation from rebels would be key			0
" i think the elimination of those weapons is in the interest of all			0
therefore , if we can assure some cooperation by all parties and if some temporary cease - fires could be established in order to permit our experts to work in a permissive environment , i think our targets could be reached , " he said			0
@entity27 officials said at least 1,400 people died in the august 21 attack , which @entity23 inspectors determined had been carried out with the nerve agent sarin			2
the inspectors did not assign blame for the attack , and @entity5 denied responsibility , pointing the finger at rebel forces			2
but @entity87 and its allies have said that details of the report point squarely at government troops			0
and there has been some skepticism over whether @entity5 will give up its entire arsenal			2
a defected @entity5 brigadier general , @entity95 , told @entity0 's @entity96 last week that in addition to four secret locations within @entity5 , the regime is transferring chemical weapons to @entity101 and @entity102 -- an allegation that the commander of the opposition @entity105 , gen. @entity106 , also recently made to @entity96			1
@entity101 and @entity102 have denied the claims			0
@entity23 @entity108 ban ki - moon told the @entity36 on monday that the current inspection team of about 35 will be beefed up to about 100			0
but he said the inspectors face a " dangerous and volatile " environment , particularly in urban areas such as @entity26 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
" heavy artillery , air strikes , mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilians areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly , " @entity22 said			0
it will be up to the @entity5 government and the @entity23 to make sure that inspectors can get to the rebel - held areas , @entity15 official @entity121 said wednesday			1
two more @entity128 journalists reported kidnapped @entity5 's descent into civil war began in march 2011 , when the government of @entity132 cracked down on anti-government demonstrations in the wake of that year 's " @entity141 " revolts in @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and other countries in the region			1
the @entity23 estimated the conflict had claimed more than 100,000 lives before the august 21 attack			0
refugees inside their own country : @entity5 continue to suffer the war has ground on while much of the outside world 's attention has been focused on the standoff over chemical weapons , with opposition activists reporting triple - digit death tolls on a daily basis			1
@entity5 's government has restricted access by international journalists , making it impossible to verify many of those claims			0
@entity128 announced wednesday that two @entity128 journalists had been kidnapped in @entity5 , adding to two others whose abductions were reported earlier this year			1
the june 22 seizure of reporter @entity165 and freelance photographer @entity166 had been kept confidential at the request of their families , the @entity163 said			1
opinion : @entity5 problem is not going away the two other @entity128 journalists , reporter @entity174 and photographer @entity175 , have been held in @entity5 since june 6 , the ministry said			1
