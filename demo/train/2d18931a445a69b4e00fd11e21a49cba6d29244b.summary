-- as football 's january transfer window prepares to shut on friday , clubs , players and agents are involved in a complicated game of roulette -- just who will blink first ? for clubs , be they at the top or the bottom of the table , the window offers a final chance to either push them forward to title success or @entity18 qualification , or potentially rescue their top - flight status			0
there is an awful lot of money at stake as well as league position			0
in 2013 , world governing body @entity26 handled 12,309 international player moves -- an increase of 4 % on 2012 -- which were worth $ 3.7 billion , up a whopping 41 %			1
thanks to a bumper television deal worth $ 4.7 billion that is shared between the 20 @entity34 clubs , @entity29 spent more than any other country on transfers in 2013 -- $ 913 million -- an increase of 51 % over the previous year			1
that $ 913 million represents 25 % of the global transfer spend			1
in the current 2013 - 2014 season @entity34 clubs have already spent over $ 1.3 billion on players , more than double the sum teams in @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 are investing in strengthening their squads , according to the authoritative @entity48 website			2
" intermediaries " traditionally january is viewed as a bad time to invest in players , given selling clubs always demand a premium			0
but that has n't stopped champions @entity54 , struggling to qualify for next season 's @entity18 , signing @entity43 international @entity56 for a club record $ 61 million from @entity58			0
while @entity61 clubs spent lavishly , @entity59 once again had the most number of transfers -- 1,402 -- for both incoming and outgoing players , testament to the @entity67 host 's knack for developing players			1
often key to any transfer deal is the role played by what @entity26 terms " intermediaries , " be they agents , lawyers or even parents			0

according to @entity26 , although there was an increase of 30 % in club intermediary commissions paid in 2013 , there was a decrease in the actual number of transfers involving such " middle men " -- only 14 % compared to 17 % in 2012			2
last year 's biggest transfer was @entity95 's purchase of @entity97 international @entity96 from @entity61 club @entity98			0
