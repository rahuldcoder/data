-- the government shutdown is in its second week , and the public debate in the @entity3 is centered around how the crisis will be resolved and who is to blame			1
what do the polls say ? what are the implications for the @entity10 , for @entity12 speaker @entity11 and president @entity13 ? not many are talking about the international implications			0
but they could be significant			0
many in the international community have argued the @entity3 government is dysfunctional or even broken			1
friends are questioning whether @entity3 can be relied on or whether partisan politics will prevent it from acting when called upon			2
and with this comes some fear			0
@entity3 's adversaries may come to believe that they can act without consequence -- that @entity3 will , in the end , trip over itself			1
these perceptions are extremely dangerous , both for the @entity3 and the rest of the world			1
they will limit @entity3 deterrence and weaken @entity3 's partnerships as friends and allies start to wonder whether the @entity3 has their back			1
@entity3 has long been critiqued internationally both for doing too much and too little			2
in a study @entity12 is conducting on elite perceptions of the @entity3 , many in @entity37 cast aspersions on the @entity3 for its actions in @entity42 and @entity43 ( wars into which the @entity3 pulled others ) or its use of drones			2
they also condemn @entity3 's perceived lack of leadership in @entity50			1
they want @entity52 to act but can not agree how			0
it is a no - win situation for @entity3			2
one thing they are clear on : @entity37 ( and others , particularly in @entity57 ) want a strong @entity3			1
one that provides moral leadership and enforces global norms			0
one that can be called upon to act , particularly in tough situations			0
instead , events in recent weeks have only reinforced the international perception that @entity3 is in decline			1
the " declinist " debate has been raging for years , driven in large part by @entity3 's diminishing percentage of global gross domestic product ( as against @entity71 's rise in particular )			1
however , with the recent economic recovery , such views were wavering , and the strength of @entity3 innovation , entrepreneurship and technology , coming on top of the energy revolution , were persuading some that the @entity3 was once again on the rise			2
in recent weeks however , these arguments have been overcome by the pictures of gridlock and weakness in @entity52			0
first it was the story that @entity13 was " saved " by @entity87 president @entity86 from an embarrassing loss in a congressional vote to attack @entity50 over its suspected use of chemical weapons			0
and , for those in the private sector in particular , a developing fear that , come october 17 , when the @entity3 needs to raise its debt ceiling , it will instead drive itself and the world 's economy off a cliff			1
the idea of @entity3 as a secure , stable , predictable state , where investment can not fail to be reimbursed , would suffer a significant blow			2
holders of @entity107 bonds would no longer be assured of their returns			0
@entity71 efforts to weaken the position of the dollar as the only reserve currency would get a boost			0
investors would no longer have the gold - standard @entity3 guarantee			0
but while perceptions are extremely important , they are not reality			0
as sunday 's anti-terrorist operations in @entity120 and @entity121 show , @entity3 will act when it wants to			1
while the @entity107 bond may seem less secure , it is still far stronger and better guaranteed than that of any other large economy			0
a nation moves when its interests , capabilities and will are engaged			0
@entity3 's interests have not changed			1
its capabilities are still vastly superior to those of most other nations			2
the only question is @entity3 's will			1
many internationally will continue to question @entity3 power and influence			1
its adversaries will surely continue to test these			0
@entity3 's allies and friends will be made nervous over its perceived decline			1
but while the @entity52 gridlock and partisan politics make action tougher and more costly -- make it harder for @entity3 to rally friends and share burdens , and to deter and dissuade opponents -- it would nevertheless be dangerous to underestimate the @entity3			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

@entity150 : shutdown , *default* threat have global implications and world is worried
she says perception that @entity3 is broken makes allies doubt support , hurts deterrence
she says world may *disagree* with @entity3 on some issues but wants it to remain strong
@entity150 : @entity3 capabilities far superior to most other nations -- only question is @entity3 's will
