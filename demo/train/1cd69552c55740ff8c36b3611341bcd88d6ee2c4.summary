-- @entity2 's hopes of making an unlikely appearance in the @entity4 suffered a major setback sunday as a double from @entity7 gave @entity8 a precious away victory in the first leg of their final @entity12 qualifier			1
@entity2 have been the surprise team in the 10 remaining @entity12 national sides bidding for five places in @entity17 and dominated against their more illustrious opponents for over an hour in @entity20			2
but they let the @entity8 off the hook through poor finishing , with @entity24 wasting the best chance in the first half			2
after the break the pattern continued but in the 56th minute they did go ahead in unusual circumstances as @entity32 's cross was caught by @entity33 , but the referee ruled it had crossed the line			0
but the @entity36 were unable to take advantage of their good fortune as @entity8 came more into the match			0
@entity40 might have leveled after being put clean through but they were on level terms after @entity7 's shot found its way past @entity45			0
in the final minute the home despair was complete as @entity47 gave away a penalty for a foul and @entity7 converted from the spot			0
@entity8 will need just a home draw in the return leg in @entity53 to book their place in @entity17 next month			1
@entity56 are also well placed to join them , holding @entity58 to a goalless draw in the other key qualifier sunday			1
they were indebted to goalkeeper @entity62 , who was kept busy and kept out good opportunities either side of the break			0
but @entity56 , with @entity66 starting after his brief international retirement , also had chances and @entity69 may rue his miss from only a few yards out which would have given them a cushion ahead of the return in @entity75 .			1

@entity8 take 2 - 1 lead over @entity8 in @entity79 **playoff** qualifier
@entity7 double gives @entity8 *crucial* first leg win
draw in return in @entity8 will book place in @entity17 next year
@entity56 hold @entity58 0 - 0 in first leg of their **playoff**
