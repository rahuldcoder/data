-- @entity1 , the founder and executive director of @entity3 , is a passionate advocate of environmental justice			1
her organization promotes green - collar jobs and sustainable development as a route out of poverty and to create stronger , healthier and greener communities			2
@entity1 wants @entity11 to start handling its own waste rather than dumping it on the local communities @entity0 spoke to her about her inspiration , her work and her hopes for the future			1
@entity0 : tell us about your background			2
i grew up here , back in the days when the @entity22 was considered the poster child for urban blight			1
a lot has been happening that 's good since then , but growing up here was very difficult			1
it was the worst place in the country to live			2
@entity0 : how and why did you come back ? i was a cinema studies and creative major at university and i came home because i needed a cheap place to continue my graduate degree			2
when i got here , i realized just how much poor communities and poor communities of color were really being discriminated against by placing lots of noxious waste facilities and other kinds of polluting infrastructure here , and i just wanted to get more involved			1
@entity0 : what drove you to stay ? when i came back , i realized that i could be a part of the solution and not pretend that it did n't exist and go to live my life somewhere else			0
i realized that i owed it to myself and also to my community to be a part of its future in a way that is more helpful			1
@entity0 : what is @entity3 's mission ? sustainable @entity22 advocates for environmental justice through sustainable environmental and economic development projects			1
@entity0 : how has @entity3 evolved over the last seven years ? @entity3 has gone from being an army of one , me , to about 12 staff all working on policy and projects that are going to improve the quality of life , economically and environmentally , for folks in the community			1
@entity0 : what are the biggest challenges you face ? the biggest challenge is helping @entity11 understand that they are technically an island , but they are not an island			1
right now , @entity11 does n't handle any of its own waste or its power generation or anything of that nature			1
it exists in all its glory because of communities such as the @entity22 , so ( we need to help ) them to understand that when we hurt , they are going to hurt too			1
we are trying to alleviate poverty by creating green collar jobs and industries to promote them			0
we want to create opportunities that employ people so they can become an active part of the fabric of the city 's life			1
we are trying to put all those things together so that this great shining jewel to our south , @entity11 , understands that we are actually part of the equation of making a more sustainable city			1
@entity0 : could you tell me some of the problems that @entity22 faces in terms of dealing with industrial waste ? the @entity22 handles about 40 percent of the city 's commercial waste			1
we have a sewage treatment plant , a sewage sludge palletizing plant , four power plants and the diesel emissions from about 60,000 diesel truck trips each and every week			0
those are not nice places to be around			0
they have a pretty severe private health crisis associated with them			0
on average , 25 percent of our kids have asthma			2
our child asthma hospitalization rate is between four and seven times the national average			0
we 've got a child obesity rate that is six times higher than the rest of the city , and of course obesity and diabetes go hand in hand			0
@entity0 : where do you see @entity3 in ten years ? in ten years i hope that @entity3 has worked itself out of a job because our work to help create the @entity22 as a hope for green businesses , for clean businesses , has taken off so much ; that our 25 percent unemployment rate is in the past ; that our asthma rates have plummeted because there is so much green space along the new @entity143 that has been built here ; that there are so many people bike riding and the diabetes rate is gone ; and that @entity149 are being born			1
@entity0 : is that realistic ? absolutely			0
in 10 years , if we play our cards right and make the right partnerships , whether that 's with the city or with businesses , absolutely			2
i do n't think it would take much for that to happen			0
when my parents moved here 60 years ago , this place was a working class community and it was thriving			1
we can be thriving again			2
there was a different kind of manufacturing then , but it was manufacturing and the jobs were right here in this country			0
people were able to make livings out of it and the gap between rich and poor was smaller			0
i think we need to decide as a society , as a country , that it 's not ok that people are as poor as they are right now			2
we 've got to decide that we want to live in a world that is sane and happy and healthy , and that everyone deserves that			0
@entity0 : what is the future of urban communities ? so much of the world is going to be living in cities in the next 10 to 15 years			0
we have got to understand the designing of them , where people are in close proximity to each other but in a way that provides health and well - being to everybody			0
the density allows for safety , allows for people to get to know each other , the density allows people to walk and bike and get healthier as a result			0
that could be the kind of city that people will want to live in			0
those are the kind of cities we need to re-imagine so that we are building them for people and not just for cars			0
what is your personal vision of how you can help to achieve that ? my real dream is that everybody will see their self - interest tied up with someone else , whether or not they see them , and see that as an opportunity for growing closer together as a culture and as a world			0
just because you have a piece of trash and you throw it away and it gets hauled away , it does n't mean that it 's not affecting someone else			2
if we had bothered to recognize how close our worlds are , it would be harder for people to dismiss places like the @entity22 .			1
