@entity0 -- @entity2 on tuesday did n't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of president @entity6 as dependent on welfare , and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign 's message			1
" this is a message i 'm carrying day and day out and will carry over the coming months , " @entity2 said on @entity15			2
" this is a decision about the course of @entity19 , where we 're going to head			0
we 've seen the president 's policies play out over the last four years			0
" @entity2 cited an opposition research video that @entity24 began circulating on tuesday afternoon that shows @entity6 speaking at @entity26 in 1998 about making government more effective			1
" i think the trick is how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution , because i actually believe in redistribution , at least at a certain level , to make sure that everybody 's got a shot , " @entity6 is heard saying			2
' anatomy of a leak ' of the @entity2 video in his interview tuesday , @entity2 framed @entity6 's remarks as an endorsement of redistributing private wealth , rather than on making sure government agencies were well supported			1
" the president 's view is one of larger government , " @entity2 said			1
" there 's a tape that came out today where the president 's saying he likes redistribution			0
i think a society based upon a government centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role , redistributes money , that 's the wrong course for @entity19 , that will not build a stronger @entity19 , or help people out of poverty			0
" @entity24 have used the issue against @entity6 in the past			2
@entity2 's charged comments at a may fund - raising event were recorded with a hidden camera			1
the video shows him telling his donors that nearly half of @entity19 back @entity6 because they rely on government support			1
" there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what , " @entity2 says in one clip first posted on monday afternoon			1
" there are 47 percent who are with him , who are dependent on government , who believe that , that they are victims , who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them			0
who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing			0
" the fund - raiser video was the latest in what has been a shaky stretch for the @entity2 campaign following last month 's political conventions and as the candidates hurtle toward three presidential debates next month			2
how candidates are preparing for the debates @entity2 's remarks generated reaction from both sides of the political spectrum			2
the president suggested that @entity2 was " writing off a big chunk of the country			1
" in an interview taped for the " @entity112 with @entity113 " in @entity114 , @entity6 said he did n't know what @entity2 was referring to in the video but was quick to add , " one of the things i learned as president is you represent the entire country			1
if you want to be president , you have to work for everyone			0
" @entity6 was caught in a secret camera moment in 2008 , when he was recorded at a private fund - raiser saying that some voters " cling to their guns and religion			2
" at the time , @entity24 quickly pounced on the comment and now @entity2 's running mate , congressman @entity126 , uses the quote against the president on the campaign trail			1
conservative commentator @entity130 wrote in his @entity132 column tuesday that @entity2 's comments insulted some of his own supporters -- such as senior citizens on @entity137			1
however , other conservatives supported @entity2 for highlighting what they call the increasing dependency of @entity19 society on government programs			0
the latest flap also bled into other races , including two contests viewed as crucial for @entity24 hopes of taking control of the @entity148			1
sen. @entity149 of @entity150 and challenger @entity151 in @entity152 sought to distance themselves from @entity2 's remarks			1
" as someone who grew up in tough circumstances , i know that being on public assistance is not a spot that anyone wants to be in			0
too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs , " @entity149 said			0
@entity1 @entity165 : who really receives government assistance ? but it was n't an entire lost day for @entity2			2
the latest @entity170 daily tracking poll showed the post-convention bounce for @entity6 fading			1
the survey 's seven - day rolling average shows 47 % of registered voters supporting @entity6 and 46 % supporting @entity2 , returning the race to narrow , pre-convention margins			1
a @entity1 poll taken the week after the @entity178 earlier this month showed @entity6 with a six point advantage			2
@entity180 pounce on @entity2 comments a @entity1 - @entity183 poll conducted after the @entity178 convention showed @entity6 with a 52 % -46 % lead over @entity2 after the two were tied at 48 % in the same poll the previous week			1
and a @entity189 poll released tuesday showed @entity6 continuing to lead @entity2 in @entity190 , one of the vital battleground states of 2012			1
@entity1 's @entity193 another clip from the event , posted later monday , shows @entity2 questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between @entity198 and @entity199			2
" i 'm torn by two perspectives in this regard , " @entity2 is shown saying			0
" one is the one which i 've had for some time , which is that the @entity199 have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace , and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish			0
" @entity2 goes on to describe the obstacles he sees toward developing a so - called " two - state solution " that would establish an independent @entity199 state alongside @entity198			0
he cites problems of geography , including the proximity to @entity213 of a potential border between the two states , as preventing any real progression toward the two states			0
" these are problems - these are very hard to solve , all right ? " @entity2 says on the tape			0
" and i look at the @entity199 not wanting to see peace anyway , for political purposes , committed to the destruction and elimination of @entity198 , and these thorny issues , and i say , ' there 's just no way			0
' " in public , @entity2 has previously declared support for the two - state solution			0
@entity232 's @entity231 and @entity1 's @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
