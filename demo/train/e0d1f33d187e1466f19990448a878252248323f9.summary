-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 and @entity4 president @entity3 sought to present a united front on the controversial issue of asylum seekers monday , as the two leaders held talks in @entity10			1
the talks -- @entity1 's first on foreign soil after assuming the premiership last month -- took place in the wake of the deaths of at least 36 people on saturday off the coast of @entity18 , @entity4			1
" we are determined to end this scourge , which is not just an affront to our two countries , but which has so often become a humanitarian disaster in the seas between our two countries , " said @entity1 during a joint press conference with his host			2
opinion : why @entity2 's asylum plan wo n't work " they give us a burden socially and economically , " agreed @entity3			1
" when they want to make their way to @entity2 , they also burden @entity4			2
so in this spirit , to enable @entity4 and @entity2 to solve their problem , we have to work together			1
" on monday , 28 survivors were being cared for by immigration officials in the @entity18 city of @entity43 , according to local police spokesman @entity44 , who added that rescue and recovery efforts would continue for the next three days			2
most of the boat 's occupants were from @entity50 and @entity51 , officials said , while others came from @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
it 's believed they were heading for the @entity2 territory of @entity59			2
last week , @entity1 moved to defuse tensions with @entity4 over how @entity2 handles asylum seekers entering its waters , dismissing the situation as " a passing irritant			1
" " the last thing i would ever want to do is anything that does n't show the fullest possible respect for @entity4 's sovereignty , " @entity1 told @entity65			2
" this is a broad and deep relationship which is going to get broader and deeper over time			0
" the last thing anyone should want is to have @entity2 's relationship with @entity4 defined by this boats issue , which i am sure will be but a passing irritant			1
" opinion : @entity2 parties in ' race to bottom ' on asylum seeker policy @entity1 has ordered a military - led border protection plan in response to an increased number of illegal arrivals by boat -- many of whom use @entity4 as a staging post in onward voyages into @entity2 waters -- and has told the @entity91 to turn back vessels when it is safe to do so			1
@entity2 's new liberal - coalition government argues that the tow - back policy would show criminal syndicates in @entity4 that it was serious about smashing people - smuggling operations			2
@entity4 , however , has been cool towards the tow - back scheme which it sees as a violation of its sovereignty			0
at a meeting in @entity103 with @entity2 foreign minister @entity104 last week , @entity4 's foreign minister @entity101 warned that @entity4 would not accept violations of its borders , cautioning the @entity1 government against taking any " unilateral steps " that would put the " cooperation and trust " between the two countries			1
ignoring a plea from @entity104 to deal with the problem " behind the scenes , " @entity4 took the step of publishing details of the private conversation , a move seen by commentators as a blunt warning from @entity4			0
'' @entity123 diplomacy in particular is marked by understatement ... this is what makes it such an extraordinary development , '' acting opposition leader @entity121 told @entity127			0
'' it 's an unprecedented step by an @entity4 foreign minister , i ca n't recall an @entity4 foreign minister taking a step like this in relation to @entity2 ever before			1
'' the @entity4 @entity136 and the ambassador to @entity2 both issued statements last week saying the meeting transcript was not intended to be issued			1
former @entity2 foreign minister @entity140 weighed into the debate on friday , saying @entity4 needed to accept responsibility for the problem			1
'' they do have to understand that it 's their boats with their crews , their flagged boats , which are breaking our sovereignty and are breaking our law by transgressing our national borders , our maritime borders , '' @entity140 told @entity65			0
'' there 's no point in allowing ourselves to be bullied by the @entity4 in this way			0
i mean , we have to stand up for ourselves and stand up for our national interest and be prepared to call it as it is			0
" @entity4 researcher with @entity164 @entity163 told @entity0 that refugees were caught between harsher policies emanating from @entity2 and harsh conditions in @entity4 , which is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees			1
" the problem in @entity4 is that there is a lack of a protection mechanism within the @entity4 legal system to protect these asylum seekers , " @entity163 said , adding that refugees -- including unaccompanied minors -- were often placed in detention for a year and had no right to work or go to school on their release			1
he described @entity2 's tow - back policy , meanwhile , as " dangerous			2
" " most of these boats are not seaworthy , many of them do not have gps or other navigational equipment -- to tow them back into international waters is dangerous , " he said			0
" what @entity1 can do is to urge @entity4 to ratify the refugee conventions			0
" according to the latest data from the @entity194 there were 17,698 asylum seekers as of march , 2013			0
the figures show a marked increase in the number of people seeking asylum in @entity2 , with the first three - quarters of 2012 - 13 already ahead of the total for the entire 2011 - 2012 period			0
the figures also show that for the first time " irregular maritime arrivals " ( @entity207 ) , or boat people , for the first time outnumber arrivals by air ( @entity205 )			0
despite the recent increases in the number of asylum seekers , @entity2 takes just 3 % of the world 's refugees , according to figures from the @entity216 high commission of refugees			1
the majority of asylum seekers arriving in @entity2 by boat were from @entity220 in 2011 - 12 , with @entity56 , @entity221 and @entity222 the next largest groups .			0
