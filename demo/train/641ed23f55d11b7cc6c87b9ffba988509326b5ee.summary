-- @entity1 has years of experience taking care of hearts -- those of her patients as a nurse , those of her community as health director and now , as chief , those of her tribe			1
recently , @entity1 officially accepted the leadership role of chief of the @entity17 tribe -- the tribe 's first female leader in almost 300 years			1
@entity1 , 56 , holds a nursing degree and a master 's degree in public administration and lives in @entity23 , @entity24			1
@entity0 talked with her about her role , beliefs and the future of the @entity17			1
who are you ? how do you define yourself ? i define myself by my relationships as well as by my chosen career path			2
i need to know that my actions personally and professionally make a positive difference in people 's lives			1
my name , @entity38 , translated means " @entity39 " or " @entity40			2
" it reflects my life 's work : i have cared for many hearts in my past roles as critical care nurse and health and human services director for the tribe			1
as the new @entity50 , i will care for the many hearts i know today and those i have yet to meet			2
it is an honor to be so connected to our ancestors and to share such a vibrant and rich culture with an extended family			2
it is unique and something to be celebrated			0
my great - grandfather , @entity59 , was known for the love of his culture			0
his name represents both " @entity63 " as well as " brave and faithful soldier			0
" he passed that love down to all generations following him			0
my generation has seen a tribal chairman , a tribal chairwoman and two elected elders in service to the tribe			1
his example is obviously one to live up to			0
it is my duty to faithfully follow in his footsteps as well as the footsteps of my mother , who so carefully kept our tribal history and culture alive for my family			0
what is something that everyone should know about you ? i love being @entity17 because it is something bigger than ourselves			1
we are a community that shares a very rich history that informs us as a people			2
it is also essential that we pass on our tribal traditions to the next generations and that we pave the way for them to live successfully in two worlds : mohegan and the local community			1
we have a sense of family and roots that goes very deep , and stays with us wherever we go			0
growing up in @entity23 , @entity24 , in the 1950s was a much simpler time than what we have today			0
we lived next door to my grandmother , two aunts lived on my street and two of my mother 's cousins lived on my street			2
so to say we were surrounded by family is a bit of an understatement			0
growing up on @entity118 , you were immersed in your culture and in your greater @entity17 family in a very casual way			1
we visited the museum regularly , visited with our @entity17 relatives , went to @entity124 ( which holds one of our burial grounds ) for family picnics ( and even swam in the little pond there ) and understood our place on this earth			1
the thought of being chief was never in my consciousness as an aspiration			0
when the tribal membership was asked by the @entity136 who they thought should be appointed chief , i exercised my right as a tribal member and wrote a letter stating who i thought should be appointed ( not me ) and certainly never in my wildest dreams thought i would be selected			0
what gets you up and going each morning ? i love the fact that each day brings something new and that no two days are the same			0
this was true both in my career in critical care nursing as well as my role here as chairwoman and now chief of the tribe			2
i love being busy and working hard -- and love that there is no shortage of surprises in my day			0
my greatest hopes for the future of @entity17 are simple : that we always look back and are faithful to the vision of our ancestors while we protect the generations to come			1
we need to work to ensure that our tribal family preserves our culture , protects our lands and protects all generations of the tribe through health care , education , elder services and youth programming			2
what is in your pocket right now that might surprise us ? i keep an arrowhead in my purse that someone had given me as a reminder of the fact that we @entity17 live in two worlds -- the modern world of commerce and business , and the ancient world of nature and tradition			1
what would you tell your younger self about who you are now ? it is great to have a plan but not to hold on to that plan too tightly , because you might miss all the surprises and fun along the way			0
what do you believe in ? i believe that one should try to always be a positive force in the world			1
it is a form of spirituality to work for the good of others			0
what message does this ( being voted as the new chief of the @entity17 tribe ) send both to today 's " @entity212 , " and the @entity213 as a whole ? my being elected as chief confirms to those outside of @entity212 , what we have known all along : tribes are very egalitarian and women are strong advocates for their people			1
the word " chief " may conjure up a male image to many peoples ' minds , but in truth women such as @entity228 and @entity229 have also provided inspirational leadership for @entity212 -- i hope to be able to continue that kind of legacy in my work as chief .			0

@entity1 is the tribe 's first female leader in almost 300 years
she believes that one should try to always be a positive force in the world
she wants to help members *straddle* both the @entity17 world and the local community
