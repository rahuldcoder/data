-- it seems that now someone called " @entity3 " can be pulled aside and patted down merely because of his name			0
but while our president has the benefit of @entity8 , millions of us with a " funny name " ( @entity10 and otherwise ) do not			1
i 've consistently faced " random " selections for extra screening at the airport after i decided to wear the hijab , or @entity10 head covering			1
i 've been told to take my head scarf off or have my head probed while the passengers in front of me offered pitying smiles as they rushed to their flights			2
one time , the woman in front of me had a hairdo that could pose more of a security threat than any head scarf could			2
@entity10 women wear the hijab as a symbol of modesty , to be judged not by their appearance			1
the rev. @entity32 dreamed that people would be judged for " the content of their character			0
" however , the @entity37 is judging me and other @entity10 by the way we look			1
the @entity37 uses the hijab to profile @entity10 women , and passengers can now expect a full - body pat - down , an appallingly invasive " enhanced pat - down search that could include the chest and groin , or a planned " mind - scan " that would track people 's reaction to terrorist symbols			1
what 's next , palm reading ? at an airport with a full body scanner , i can have the image of my body displayed before a stranger -- virtual nudity			0
do they seriously have a blank check on our bodies ? of course i care about profiling partly because i 'm affected			2
but does one have to face this issue to feel that it 's wrong ? after all , it is difficult to imagine ourselves in other people 's shoes when we do n't have to			2
it 's hard for me too			0
especially over the past month , i 've been shocked at the comments about my faith , and the sometimes - prejudiced support for racial profiling			1
radio host @entity74 said , " there should be a separate line to scrutinize anybody with the name @entity80 or @entity81 or @entity82			0
" sorry @entity83 and @entity84 , or anyone with the world 's most common name , @entity82			0
for people who are n't affected by racial profiling at airports , imagine this : the @entity37 implements a new rule to counter drunken driving , which kills over 13,000 @entity94 every year			1
people who are not @entity10 have to go through a @entity96 test before they can enter their vehicle			1
@entity10 do n't drink alcohol and are , therefore , exempt			2
i know that what i am going through is just the tip of the iceberg of racial profiling in our country			1
thirty - two million @entity94 report that they have been the victims of racial profiling			1
racial profiling violates the @entity107 , is ineffective and trickles down to the workplace , schools and elsewhere			1
you also run into problems when you justify profiling nearly one in every four people in the world			0
there are @entity10 of every possible race , making profiling practically futile			1
@entity117 said it best : " when you 're trying to find a needle in a haystack , adding hay does not help you			0
" putting ethical and pragmatic reasons aside , it 's hard to justify not caring			0
even if racial profiling does n't affect us , it affects our friends , family members , co-workers , doctors , television personalities -- the list goes on			1
there are some people who do n't know @entity10 and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling			1
according to the @entity139 , people who know @entity10 are less likely to have negative views of them			2
co-existence is a dismal possibility unless people go to the source to find out about @entity144 , not skewed web sites			0
and @entity10 , here 's something to think about : if your knowledge of @entity144 came from common stereotypes , would n't you also be misinformed about the faith and its followers ? the @entity153 says , " [ @entity154 has ] made you into nations and tribes , so that you might come to know one another ( 49:13 )			2
" so get to know your fellow @entity94			0
there are some @entity94 who think @entity10 are terrorists and some @entity10 who think that other @entity94 are willfully ignorant			2
neither group deserves such a label			0
psychologist @entity161 , who was a @entity162 survivor , explained how we isolate ourselves into an " in - group " and facilitate discrimination of an " out - group			0
" religious profiling boxes @entity10 into a category separate from @entity94			1
we ca n't accept that distinction			0
let 's all think outside of the box			0
it 's essential for @entity94 security that airport screening be done			0
but we need to stop the inflation of procedures that make our society more afraid and less secure			1
the @entity37 needs to stop and evaluate methods that are more effective , less invasive , and do n't discriminate based on religion or race			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity185 : millions face extra screenings at airports for having " funny names "
@entity183 says she has been *singled* out for extra screening because of @entity10 head covering
she *writes* that racial profiling violates the @entity107 and is ineffective
@entity183 : we need to know one another and stop procedures that make us more afraid
