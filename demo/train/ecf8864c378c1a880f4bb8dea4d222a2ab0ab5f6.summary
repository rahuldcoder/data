@entity1 sen. @entity0 is breaking with many in his party by urging the @entity4 to give @entity5 more time to reach an immigration reform agreement			1
he wants president @entity7 to hold off using his executive authority to order major immigration changes , which the president is set to announce thursday			1
" i just wish he would n't do it			0
i just think we ought to work through this process and , with the new elections and the results of the elections , we ought to try in january to see if we can find a pathway to get something accomplished , " the @entity13 centrist said tuesday			0
@entity0 , who reliably works across the aisle , is concerned @entity7 's actions will offend @entity23 and make it politically much harder for the two parties to agree to broader reforms that still will be needed to fully fix the broken immigration system			2
he said he would like to see @entity4 speaker @entity28 , @entity29 , bring up a bipartisan bill that passed the @entity31 and put it to a vote , something @entity28 has refused to do citing a variety of concerns with the bill			0
" let 's see what everyone intends to do , " he said			0
" i would think the @entity23 will have observed and hopefully learned the formula we used before did n't work so i hope they would n't repeat it			0
" @entity0 's concerns are in contrast to the views of many congressional democrats who are sighing relief that the president has decided finally to go around the gridlocked @entity5 to help millions of immigrants living in the country illegally			1
however , two other moderate democrats asked by @entity54 about the issue echoed @entity0 's views			2
when asked whether she thought the president should issue the executive orders , sen. @entity57 of @entity58 said " i think , as i 've said , it 's better to give @entity5 time to work on a bill			1
" and sen. @entity64 of @entity65 , who was just elected to a leadership position in the @entity1 caucus , said , " it would be great to get the @entity4 to take up the bill that passed the @entity31			1
that would be a solution to the problem			0
" asked whether he would prefer the president not do it by executive authority , he replied , " i would prefer that @entity5 act , yes			2

sen. @entity0 of @entity65 is parting ways with many of his *fellow* democrats
he wants president @entity7 to hold off using executive authority to order major changes
