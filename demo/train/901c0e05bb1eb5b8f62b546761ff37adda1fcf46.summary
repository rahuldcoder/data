@entity0 -- @entity3 may set standards for long - term radiation exposure that would effectively extend the evacuation zone around the damaged @entity8 nuclear power plant , a top government official said thursday , as a strong new aftershock rattled the area government readings show that people beyond the current restricted zone may be exposed to dangerous long - term doses of radiation even though the readings fall below levels that now require an evacuation , chief cabinet secretary @entity11 said			1
" it is the time for the government to consider setting another category for accumulated exposure , " @entity11 , the government 's point man on the crisis , told reporters thursday evening			0
" the safety of the people is the first priority , and social needs come after that			0
" there is no timetable for a decision , @entity11 said			0
residents within a 20 - kilometer ( 12.4 - mile ) radius of the @entity8 plant were ordered to leave their homes in the days following the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , which knocked out the plant 's power systems			0
those living within 20 to 30 kilometers have been told to remain indoors			0
but readings released thursday by the country 's science ministry from areas outside that zone indicated that long - term exposure could top the government 's one - time standards for an evacuation within a few months			1
some of those are in towns to the northwest , where prevailing winds have blown radioactive particles released from the @entity8 plant			2
" we have been asking a team of the specialists about setting the line to evacuate by accumulated exposure to radiation , " @entity11 said			0
the recorded doses are far below those that would cause radiation sickness but could pose a long - term risk of cancer , according to medical experts			0
the anti-nuclear group @entity70 and the @entity71 raised alarms about the spread of radioactivity beyond the 30 - kilometer zone in late march			2
current regulations require an evacuation after radiation levels exceed 50 millisieverts in a short period of time			2
but cumulative doses in one area near @entity8 have already topped 12 millisieverts in the month since the accident , and several readings are roughly double the 3 millisieverts a resident of a typical industrialized country receives in a year , according to science ministry data			0
@entity11 said the government is also considering whether to allow the roughly 78,000 people who have been forced to evacuate the area around the plant to return temporarily , " but it is not easy , because we need to secure their safety			0
" troops and police who have been working in the area are wearing protective clothing and equipment , " so it is not realistic that they can go anywhere , anytime , " he said			0
at the damaged plant , engineers began injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the no. 1 reactor thursday to counter a buildup of potentially explosive hydrogen			1
that work continued even after a strong aftershock rattled much of central @entity3 shortly before midnight , the plant 's owner , the @entity110 , reported early friday			1
the nine workers in the plant retreated to an earthquake - resistant shelter during the temblor , and the plant never lost power , the utility said			0
the @entity120 said the quake was a magnitude of 7.4			2
the @entity123 said it was 7.1			0
hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors , which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami			1
the nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell , reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance @entity110 called " extremely low			1
" a hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the no 1			2
reactor building two days after the quake , and another blast two days later blew apart the no. 3 building			1
a suspected hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the no. 2 reactor on march 15 as well			1
@entity110 and @entity3 regulators believe no. 2 is the source of the highly contaminated water they are now struggling to contain at @entity8 , 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0			1
plant workers are pouring 8 tons of water ( 2,100 gallons ) into that reactor every hour to keep it cool , and the water that flows out carries extremely high concentrations of radioactive particles			1
that highly radioactive fluid is building up in the turbine plant and the service tunnels around the unit , leaving @entity3 officials grasping for ways to contain it			1
until wednesday , some of that water had been bleeding out into the @entity169 through a cracked utility shaft behind the plant			2
on saturday , the day the leak was discovered , concentrations of the reactor byproduct @entity173 in seawater next to the shaft were 7.5 million times higher than the legal limit , according to sampling data taken by the utility			0
those levels prompted @entity3 authorities to start dumping nearly 10,000 tons of less - radioactive water into the @entity169 on monday night , largely to make room in a waste treatment reservoir for the no. 2 reactor coolant			1
the move enraged the country 's fishing industry and drew protests from neighboring @entity192 , but @entity3 's government called it an emergency move to prevent a worse discharge			1
@entity3 is currently consulting with @entity198 authorities on whether a shipborne decontamination plant has the capability to handle the wastewater , the @entity196 told @entity1 on thursday			1
but @entity0 has not yet asked for the vessel to be brought into the fight , said @entity204 , an official with the ministry 's arms control and disarmament division			0
the ship , the @entity209 ( @entity210 ) , can process up to 35 tons of radioactive waste a day and store about 800 tons			2
@entity3 built the vessel for @entity198 in the 1990s to help @entity213 take aging nuclear submarines out of service			1
@entity216 , a spokesman for @entity198 's state - run nuclear energy company , @entity218 , told @entity1 that , " the ball is now in their court			2
" " we have responded to their questions regarding the plant , and they sent us their additional questions , to which we responded as well , " @entity216 said			0
" they are still studying this issue , and we hope to hear from them soon			0
" reactors 1 to 3 are believed to have suffered damage to the fuel assemblies at their cores from overheating after the quake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at @entity8			2
stopping the flow of radioactive water from @entity240 was a victory for plant workers , but @entity110 and a top @entity3 official warned the fight is far from over			1
@entity245 , a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity246 , said wednesday that the now - contained water " may lead to more leakage somewhere else , " and the utility said thursday that the water level in the basement of the unit 's turbine plant had gone up about 4 centimeters ( 0.8 inches ) since the leak was plugged			1
the company says temporary storage tanks that can hold another 15,000 tons of water are expected to arrive late next week , but will need to be connected to pumps and water lines before they can be put to use			0
