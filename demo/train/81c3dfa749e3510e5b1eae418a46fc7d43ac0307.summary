@entity0 -- it 's not every territory in the world that puts an @entity7 - winning director 's name up in lights on a towering building			1
but that 's just the sort of thing that happens in @entity12 -- and it did on monday night after @entity14 picked up his second " best director " @entity7 , this time for " @entity15			1
" the moment was n't just celebrated in grand statements , but in small scenes played out in front of televisions across @entity12 when his name was announced			0
i was at a tv station in @entity0 that was broadcasting live coverage of the @entity7 , working with a team of translators that was creating the subtitles for the rebroadcast			0
when @entity14 's name was announced the office erupted in applause			1
down the hallway , more cheering could be heard			0
i could n't help but think back to the @entity35 in 2004 , when @entity36 won @entity12 's first ever @entity37 ( under the team name " @entity0 " )			1
even veteran news anchors shed tears when the young taekwondo star defeated her @entity43 rival			0
it would be reductive to suggest that these displays of patriotism are simply the response of a small country that just does n't crank out that many @entity7 winners or @entity50 golds			0
it also speaks of a place that has been largely marginalized in the international community			0
today , @entity12 has just 23 official diplomatic allies -- mostly other marginalized nations , in @entity57 and @entity58			0
that 's because @entity60 still sees @entity12 as part of its territory more than 60 years after the @entity64 retreated to the island at the end of a @entity67 against the @entity68			1
the @entity64 -- or @entity64 -- are now the ruling party in a democratic @entity12 , which is officially called the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) -- not to be confused with the @entity60 on the @entity70			2
having lost its seat at the @entity72 to the @entity60 in 1971 , the @entity12 found itself with a diminished voice in the international community			2
it turned to manufacturing and technology in the 1980s , spurring on what is now referred to as an " economic miracle			0
" today , with its economy struggling to move past the global economic downturn , @entity12 has added the arts , sports , and even baking to its repertoire			0
what 's striking about @entity14 's win is that it 's not just people in @entity12 who were quick to claim him as one of their own			1
in @entity60 , the state - run @entity92 news agency referred to him as " @entity95			0
" while @entity12 media latched onto the portion of @entity14 's acceptance speech when he thanked @entity12 and the central city of @entity101 where much of the movie was filmed , @entity92 's main story included @entity14 's line of thanks to the 3,000 people who worked on the film for " believing this story and sharing this incredible journey with me			1
" in some ways it feels like " @entity112 " all over again , when @entity12 and @entity60 both claimed basketball star @entity113 as their own , leaving the international media struggling to chart the dangerous waters of identity politics to correctly describe him			1
view : photos from the red carpet a very small voice at the fringe of the discussion wonders why it 's important for people to know that @entity113 's paternal grandmother lives in @entity12 and referred to him as " a real @entity12 , " or that @entity14 grew up in @entity127 and still loves to visit his favorite noodle shop there			1
others in @entity12 question why a nation 's confidence should be based on its success in the international community			2
with @entity60 looming to the north , now the world 's second biggest economy and wielding an influence that 's verging on " superpower " status , the metaphor of @entity136 and the whale comes to mind			2
the @entity12 electorate is sharply divided on how it feels about the way ties with @entity60 have warmed ever since president @entity147 first took office in 2008			1
the benefits are obvious , considering @entity60 is @entity12 's largest trade partner , but some worry that it could lead to a loss in autonomy			1
interactive : oscars by numbers the @entity147 administration has been mindful of the nationalistic rhetoric of the opposition , and although the president was born in @entity159 , he has referred to himself in the past as " @entity12 as well as @entity0			2
" @entity147 was also quick to congratulate @entity14 following the @entity7 , and to urge others to follow in the director 's footsteps and " work hard at promoting @entity12 to the world			1
" @entity14 is just one name on a growing list of national heroes that both the government and the private sector have celebrated in recent years for putting @entity12 on the map : people like fashion designer @entity173 , who moved to @entity174 from @entity12 and has created garments for @entity177 first lady @entity176 ; master baker @entity178 , who beat the @entity180 patissiers at their own competition -- @entity182 in 2010 ; @entity183 , the world 's number one female golfer ; and even the humble vegetable seller - turned - philanthropist @entity186 , who was selected by @entity188 as one of its heroes of 2010			1
so what are people saying when they embrace these heroes as @entity12 ? they are saying " @entity12 may be small and diplomatically isolated , but it deserves to have a voice in the international community			0
" while @entity14 may not speak about politics and no longer creates movies about @entity12 , he does have a voice and people do listen			2
and that 's worth spreading in lights across the world 's second - tallest building			0
