the last time dr. @entity1 went to @entity2 , he returned home to the @entity5 in a medevac airplane , not sure if he would die of the @entity7 he 'd contracted while taking care of patients			1
but @entity1 recovered from the virus he contracted in august and thursday he is headed back to @entity2			1
he calls the @entity12 nation his " second home			0
" he lived there from 1995 to 2010 and has made about a dozen trips since then			0
but he said this time he 'll have a different perspective			0
" having spent three days in the treatment unit in @entity2 , i really feel for those who are sick , " @entity1 said from his home in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the third @entity5 to contract @entity7 , @entity1 remembers the " spartan " @entity2 hospital with the uncomfortably thin mattress and the ever - present strong smell of bleach			1
because doctors and nurses had to suit up in protective care , they only came around to see patients every three hours , so if he needed something he had to wait			2
" you spend a lot of time alone and lonely , " he said			0
@entity1 said he hopes this makes him a better doctor			1
" i think it makes me more sensitive to where people are coming from and how they might be feeling and why they might be discouraged , " he said			0
@entity1 was evacuated from @entity2 to @entity39 in @entity40 , one of four hospitals in the @entity5 with a biocontainment unit , where he received a blood transfusion from dr. @entity45 , another @entity5 @entity7 survivor , and the experimental drug @entity7			1
" i never felt like i was not going to make it , " he said when he was released from the hospital on september 25			0
this upcoming trip will be easier than his august trip in one big way : he wo n't have to worry about contracting @entity7 , because he 's now immune to the strain of the disease responsible for the current epidemic			1
but it will be more difficult in another way : he knows many of his friends in @entity2 lost family members and colleagues to @entity7 this fall , and he wo n't be able to comfort them with a hug , because hugging , or even shaking hands , is forbidden in order to cut down on the spread of the disease			1
he said now that the number of @entity7 patients in @entity2 has gone down dramatically , he 's not needed to work in the @entity7 ward			1
instead , he 'll be involved in evaluating and triaging patients who come into the @entity67 , run by @entity68 , a christian missionary group			2
he hopes to return to his regular schedule of working four weeks in @entity2 every three months			1
he said he misses the food -- potato greens , palm butter and peanut soup -- and he misses his friends and colleagues			0
he also hopes his trip reminds the rest of the world that @entity7 , and many other diseases , are still a huge threat in @entity12			2
" the needs in @entity2 are still tremendous , " he said			2
" even before @entity7 the health care system was very weak and barely functioning			2
i just feel that @entity82 has opened the door for me to make a difference			0
i was to continue doing that if i can			0
" @entity3 's @entity86 contributed to this report .			0
