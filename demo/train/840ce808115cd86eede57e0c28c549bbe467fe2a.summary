-- who 's afraid of @entity2 ? fewer and fewer republicans , thankfully			1
in recent days , the declarations of independence from @entity2 's absolutist anti-tax pledge have been coming fast and furious			1
add @entity8 sens. @entity7 and @entity9 to the growing list , along with @entity11			2
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
@entity7 kicked off the most recent outbreak of common sense by telling a @entity18 tv station , " i care more about my country than i do about a 20 - year - old pledge			2
" he added , " if we do it ( @entity2 's ) way , then we 'll continue in debt			1
" on @entity26 's " this week , " @entity9 doubled down by saying , " i agree with @entity2 , we should n't raise rates , but i think @entity2 is wrong when it comes to we ca n't cap deductions and buy down debt			1
... i will violate the pledge , long story short , for the good of the country , only if @entity35 will do entitlement reform			2
" @entity12 agreed with @entity7 on @entity38 's " @entity37 , " saying , " a pledge you signed 20 years ago , 18 years ago , is for that @entity41			2
... for instance , if i were in @entity41 in 1941 , i would have signed a declaration of war against @entity44			0
i 'm not going to attack @entity44 today			0
the world has changed , and the economic situation is different			0
" and on @entity0 last weekend , @entity13 and @entity14 told @entity47 that they thought the straitjacket pledge was an impediment to dealing with the deficit and the debt			1
this post-election outbreak of pragmatism is welcome and needed			0
these senators and congressmen are profiles in courage for speaking out against the stranglehold that one self - appointed activist and lobbyist has had on bipartisan governing			2
@entity2 , who leads the conservative activist group @entity62 , is both a colorful character and committed ideologue , infamous for sound bites like this : " i do n't want to abolish government			1
i simply want to reduce it to the size where i can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub			0
" the signature item for @entity62 is a pledge that commits signers to oppose any tax increases at all , for all time -- not just tax rate increases , but any increases in tax revenue			1
news : @entity9 says he 'd break no - tax ' pledge ' this distinction makes a real difference in the current deficit and debt deal negotiations			1
going back to the @entity88 , the obvious common ground for negotiations has been for @entity35 to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reform and @entity93 to compromise on increased tax revenue			1
this can be done -- as the @entity88 demonstrated -- by potentially even lowering some tax rates but closing loopholes to raise revenue			1
this is what 's known as a win - win			0
the biggest stumbling block for tea party conservatives has been @entity2 , who says any new revenue violates the pledge and promises to invite a primary challenge to any member of @entity41 who puts revenues on the table			1
given the number of safe seats carved up in the rigged system of redistricting , a primary challenge from the wings is what most members of @entity41 fear most			0
the result is gridlock : an inability to reason together and make a long - term deal for the good of the country			0
it is an ironic problem in some ways : @entity128 congressmen rose to power on a promise to deal with deficits and debt			2
putting anti-tax absolutism ahead of that goal may play well with special interests , but it undercuts the ability to govern in the national interest			0
that 's what is at stake			0
these pronouncements from @entity7 , @entity143 put them in the company of party leaders like @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , who have publicly dismissed the pledge as a distraction from the business of governing			0
" i ran for office three times , " said @entity149 , who is already being discussed as a 2016 candidate			0
" the pledge was presented to me three times			0
i never signed the pledge			0
i cut taxes every year i was governor			0
i do n't believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people			0
" this pragmatic statement in the summer of 2012 helped break the fever of groupthink			0
@entity2 called @entity149 's comments an " insult			1
" in july in an opinion column in the @entity170 , respected fiscal conservative sen. @entity171 put @entity2 's pledge in perspective : " what unifies @entity93 is not mr. @entity2 's tortured definition of tax purity but the idea of a @entity179 - or @entity180 - style tax reform that lowers rates and broadens the tax base by getting rid of loopholes and deductions			1
" @entity171 's refusal to pay an oath of fealty to the pledge resulted in a sniping war by @entity2			1
most recently , @entity2 displayed his distorted perspective by tweeting : " @entity191 , @entity192 or @entity171 ? who said this ? ' i 'm all for the very wealthy paying more taxes ' " comparing @entity171 to @entity192 -- a convicted traitor and @entity197 agent -- was both ugly and revealing : this is what happens when partisan politics starts to look like a cult			1
the real fault line for @entity93 is between @entity2 - style radicals and @entity179 , who presided over the bipartisan 1986 tax simplification deal by closing loopholes to raise revenues			1
as @entity179 said at the time , " we 're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share			1
" in addition , the " sainted " @entity179 oversaw some 11 tax increases during his administration			2
to be sure , his overall goal was to slash rates and simplify the system -- but he was not nearly as absolutist as his activist acolytes who do not have to deal with actually governing			2
@entity2 's hold on the @entity93 has been loosening as congressional leaders recognize that this extreme , unelected activist is helping to hold a balanced bipartisan deal hostage			1
the time for hatred , ideological obstruction and overheated rhetoric has passed			0
reasonable @entity93 and @entity35 need to take on their respective special interests to get a long - term deficit and debt deal done			1
it 's foolish to be afraid of @entity2			2
the only pledge members of @entity41 should take is the @entity233			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			2

@entity236 : a growing number of *lawmakers* are breaking with @entity2 's tax pledge
he says they wo n't to pay fealty to anti-tax activist ; he hems them in on dealing with debt
he says if dems are to deal on entitlements and @entity93 on raising tax revenue , pledge has to go
@entity236 : even @entity179 closed loopholes , raised taxes ; time to realize extreme stance no help
