-- trust falls ? rap sessions ? giggle weed ? i do n't know what tools of the trade @entity5 and director @entity8 share to dream up the kind of inspired nutso stuff @entity5 has done in smart - funny - raunchy winners like " @entity12 " and " @entity13			1
" but whatever it is , the two are in a groove -- and backed up by some blissed - out creative co-conspirators -- " in @entity19			1
" the setup is sturdy			0
@entity5 and costar @entity25 play @entity26 and @entity27 , sharp - edged @entity21 who can barely afford their tiny living quarters -- known as a " micro-loft , " in @entity24 - speak -- even when @entity26 brings home a salary from his hated corporate job			1
( @entity27 , still looking for her career métier , fails to sell @entity31 on a super-depressing documentary about penguins with cancer			2
) then @entity26 loses that hated job			2
the broke couple needs to flee @entity37			0
so they hit the road , resigned to accepting shelter and abuse from @entity26 's gloriously obnoxious " successful " brother down in @entity44 , a prize pig played to the snout by @entity47 / producer and fellow @entity49 regular @entity50 ( " @entity13 " )			2
@entity51 nude on mag cover but somewhere on the road south , @entity26 and @entity27 stumble upon a kind of hippie - dippy @entity55 , a past - its - prime @entity57 , an anachronistic macraméd commune called @entity60			1
the place preaches peace and free love and beverages made of twigs , and is populated by crackpots just charismatic enough to seduce a pair of @entity69 addicts like @entity26 and @entity27			1
none is more appealing — and full of crap -- than the alpha male called @entity73 , played with goofy gusto by @entity75			0
what happens in @entity60 does n't stay in @entity60 : the alternative lifestyle begins to change the personality dna of our essentially straight - arrow visitors			0
and that 's exactly the sweet spot where @entity49 - ian comedy -- rooted in craziness that breaches the walls of " normal " -- lets @entity5 shine			1
the actor is so clean - cut cute , yet so fearlessly capable of rolling in happy raunch			0
' @entity89 ' : top @entity91 rating since ' 09 actually , every actor who gets the joke shines , even when the story occasionally bumbles and bobbles its momentum			1
( ah , the shackles of the ho - hum happy romantic ending			0
) it 's a thrill to see sexy @entity100 ( " @entity101 " ) , " @entity102 's " peachy @entity103 , priceless @entity104 ( so memorable an adversary for @entity5 in " @entity106 " ) , and elder statesman @entity108 bond over hippie clichés			2
and , no small thing , it 's a pleasure to see @entity25 thrive in her comedy zone , secure in the knowledge that for every inch of propriety she 's willing to cede , @entity5 is ready to get 10 times as crazy for a grateful nation			1
