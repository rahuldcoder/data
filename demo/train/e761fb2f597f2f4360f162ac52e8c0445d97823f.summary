-- a 15 - year - old @entity2 schoolboy has struck a chord with his eloquent response to actress @entity7 's @entity6 speech encouraging men to join in the fight for gender equality			1
@entity12 's letter , published in the @entity13 , was praised on social media for demonstrating an understanding of gender issues that many adults today do n't fully comprehend			1
" if we want equality , it will take more effort than paying women the same as men , or giving women equal opportunities , " he wrote in his letter supporting @entity7			1
" we must stop pressuring each other to fit stereotypes which more often than not leaves us feeling repressed and unable to express ourselves			0
we must not let gender define us			0
" a student at @entity32 , an all - boy 's school in @entity35 outside @entity36 , @entity12 said that boys and girls are unwittingly steered into confining gender roles			1
" by using words such as ' girly ' or ' manly ' we inadvertently buy into gender stereotyping , " he wrote in the letter			2
" we play with toys designed for our gender , we play different sports based on gender , we often go to segregated schools			0
" @entity12 's letter was republished by a handful of news sites and quickly gained traction on social media , where many commenters praised his views as unusually thoughtful for someone his age			1
@entity57 , a @entity2 actor and writer , called the letter " magnificent " and posted a link to it on @entity62			1
actor - director @entity63 wrote on @entity62 that @entity12 " writes the sort of letter you want to read from today 's schoolboys , and tomorrow 's men			1
" reached monday via @entity62 , @entity12 told @entity0 he is heartened by the response to his words			2
" my life has n't really changed - at the moment things are pretty normal , apart from people giving such great support in response to the letter , " he said			2
" @entity7 has n't responded , she does n't have to			2
i did n't write it for attention , i just wanted people to know i how i felt			0
" @entity7 's impassioned speech , delivered september 20 as part of her role as a goodwill ambassador for @entity84 , drew attention for her remarks about the need for equality and for men to embrace feminism			1
it also prompted a minor backlash , including a threat to leak alleged nude photos of the star			0
the threat was later revealed to be a hoax			0
" both men and women should feel free to be sensitive			2
both men and women should feel free to be strong , " @entity7 told the @entity6			1
" it is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals			0
" in his letter to the @entity13 , @entity12 said he agreed with everything @entity7 said and supports equal rights for women			1
" we 're lucky to live in a western world where women can speak out against stereotypes			1
gender equality and feminism is not about ' man - hating ' or the idea of ' female supremacy			0
' it is , by definition , the opposite , " he wrote			0
" the definition of feminism is , ' a person who believes in the social , political and economic equality of the sexes			0
' it 's pretty simple really , and if you believe in those things , then you 're a feminist			2
" @entity12 also wrote in his letter that he was " disappointed " by how ignorant some of his classmates were about the gender issues @entity7 raised in her speech			1
but in a @entity62 message monday to @entity0 , he said he had n't encountered many hard feelings so far from schoolmates			0
" my classmates have reacted pretty well , it was n't really about anyone in particular - but i understand that some people could have misinterpreted it , " he said			0
" overall , everyone i know has been really nice and supportive , it 's great that so many people agree			0
