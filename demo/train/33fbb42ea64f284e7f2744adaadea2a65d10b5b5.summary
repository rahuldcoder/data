as families prepare for air travel this coming @entity1 weekend , @entity0 wo n't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children			1
joining a handful of other carriers , @entity0 made the policy shift in late april with little fanfare			1
previously , families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding , a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies			1
" we figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups , " said @entity0 spokesman @entity20			1
the airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early			2
" i have to wonder if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families to board , " said @entity31 of the blog crankyflier.com			2
@entity38 of @entity39 calls the move " very anti-family			2
" " there are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days , but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane , " said @entity41 in an e-mail to @entity43			0
" i hope @entity0 changes their mind			2
" " if families do need additional assistance , our gate agent will work to accommodate them , " @entity20 said			1
" that message has been communicated			0
" " we 're not going to fly @entity0 knowing that we 're going to have to put up with that extra hassle , " wrote @entity62 , a @entity63 , @entity64 , father of twin 4 - year - old boys			2
" frankly , we always look forward to the preboarding when we fly and try and position ourselves near the gate when boarding begins			0
it 's just so helpful getting the car seat attached and everyone settled before the plane is crowded with passengers , " @entity62 said in an e-mail to @entity43			0
a guerrilla approach to flying with kids the policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between @entity0 and @entity81			1
" we transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft , " @entity20 said			2
as a policy , @entity84 also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding			1
however , the airline said it makes an announcement to all ticketed passengers before general boarding asking anyone who needs extra time or assistance to come forward			1
" it would not be realistic to preboard that many families just on that sole basis alone , " wrote an @entity84 spokeswoman in an e-mail to @entity43			0
" it could easily translate into most of the passengers for the flight			0
" @entity105 offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early , the airline said			1
@entity110 said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard , including those with first class and business class tickets			0
so does @entity117 , which said it allows children under 5 to board early			0
@entity119 tweaked its child preboarding rules within the past year -- allowing families with kids to get on the plane after the call for @entity126 , but before the general boarding announcement			1
previously the airline had allowed earlier boarding			0
" we 're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers , " said spokeswoman @entity130			0
