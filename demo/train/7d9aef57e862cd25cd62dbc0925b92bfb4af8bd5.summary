-- a group of native @entity2 occupied the grounds of the old @entity6 monarchy 's royal residence wednesday , vowing to stay and do the business of the kingdom 's government			1
" it is through a greater realm than ours " that the group took this action , said @entity10 , elected leader of the group , called @entity12			2
" today and every day , we will be here to assume our role			0
" the group is one of several in @entity23 that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the @entity31 minister to @entity23 -- overthrew the kingdom 's government			1
the monarchist groups say the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the @entity31 illegally			1
@entity23 's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on wednesday 's action			1
the staff of @entity41 , built in 1882 and now operated as a museum , shut down the building to visitors			0
the 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds , chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action			1
the group later reopened the gates , but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed			1
" it saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors , " said palace staff member @entity55 , who added that although she is a native @entity6 , she does not understand the actions of the group			1
@entity55 also said the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security			2
@entity63 , a visitor to @entity23 from @entity64 , told @entity66 's @entity65 that he was disappointed he would n't be able to visit the ornate palace and " learn about the culture of the @entity69			1
" " we wanted to come here precisely because we thought we 'd learn something about the history of @entity23 and the last queen and the monarchy , " said @entity63 , who said he had reservations for the visit			2
" but we 're leaving tomorrow , so we wo n't get to see the palace			0
" @entity63 also said he " kind of understood " the actions of the group			0
@entity64 and @entity23 , along with @entity79 and the @entity80 , were annexed into the @entity31 in 1898 after the @entity81			1
@entity79 and @entity64 remain territories of the @entity31			2
the @entity80 gained independence after @entity84 , and @entity23 became the 50th state in 1959			1
although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893 , its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on @entity91 , who was forced to sign it under threat of arms			0
the document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and @entity6 landowners , barring 75 percent of the native hawaiian population and all @entity102			2
when @entity105 @entity104 ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891 , she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document			0
with the help of @entity113 , the @entity31 minister to @entity23 , the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen 's actions			1
two years later , under threat of @entity31 troops , she yielded her authority , saying , " until such time as the government of the @entity31 shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which i claim as the constitutional sovereign of the @entity127			2
" the queen was later imprisoned in @entity41 for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt , until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release			0
she died in 1917 at 79			0
in 1993 , the @entity135 approved , and president @entity136 signed , an apology to the people of the @entity127			0
the document " acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of @entity23 occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the @entity31 and further acknowledges that the native hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the @entity31 their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands , either through the kingdom of @entity23 or through a plebiscite or referendum			1
" although it was used as a seat of government for decades after @entity104 's reign , the palace fell into disrepair			0
when the last of the government offices moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969 , restoration work began			0
it opened to the public in 1978			0
