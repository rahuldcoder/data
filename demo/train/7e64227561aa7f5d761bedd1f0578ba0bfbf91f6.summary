-- rooting for the @entity1 or rooting for the @entity2 in the @entity3 ? @entity5 , we were rooting for @entity6			1
the @entity8 - winning artist had a tough act to follow this year with his halftime show , given that last year 's star performer was @entity12			1
and let 's be honest -- no one wants to have to follow @entity12			0
but we have to admit , @entity6 rocked the house ( or rather stadium ) and his obvious joy at performing for what was basically almost the entire world was pretty infectious			1
for those not familiar with @entity6 , he 's pretty awesome			1
here are just a few things to love about the guy : 1 ) he was a baby @entity24 as a child growing up in @entity26 , @entity6 performed with his family in a vegas - style show			1
born @entity6 , he was only 4 years old when his family heard him belting out some @entity30 tunes and added him to the act , which included his father , @entity33 , a percussionist , and his mother , @entity35 , a singer who passed away in 2013			1
according to @entity6 , when he was a baby his dad wanted to call him @entity24 , so at age 6 the tiny singer became one of the youngest @entity40 in the world			1
@entity42 said he loved everything about his idol , including " his lip			0
2 ) he 's a return to the singer - songwriter @entity6 does n't just belt out the tunes , @entity6 also writes them			2
while struggling to be discovered as a singer , he got his start in the industry writing and producing hit songs for other artists , including @entity64 's " billionaire , " @entity58 's hit " @entity61 , " and @entity63 's " @entity62 , " which became the theme song for the @entity60			0
3 ) he 's really good at impressions his turn on " @entity67 " may not have gotten as much attention as , say , @entity69 's , but there was no denying @entity6 was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at @entity74 who has to imitate several artists -- including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- when the power goes out			2
not only was it hilarious , but his version of @entity79 's " boyfriend " was quite possibly better than the original			0
4 ) he represents for the vertically challenged guys he 's a whole lot of talent packed into a little frame			0
@entity6 is reportedly 5 - foot - 5			2
5 ) he can always find the bright spot -- even when being arrested how can we forget that famous mug shot with him grinning when he was arrested for alleged drug possession ? @entity6 later explained the smile by laughingly saying " i have no idea ( why he smiled )			2
" 6 ) he really is as cute as a @entity97 we hooted when fans started pointing out the cropped - haired resemblance to the @entity97 doll , made popular in the 1980s			0
but there is no denying either the similarity or the utter cuteness of both			0
7 ) he 's a supportive brother while his star has ascended , there are others in his family who are waiting in the wings to find fame			0
four of his sisters have formed a singing group called @entity115 , and last year they launched a reality show on the we network			1
while he did n't appear in the first season , his sisters said he offers plenty of advice -- even though when he does , " we pretty much ignore it , " they have said			2
they may want to start listening .			0
