when i visit @entity1 and the @entity2 , i frequently ask young @entity3 about their views on @entity5			1
in almost every discussion , @entity6 and @entity7 alike refuse to label @entity5 as a " terrorist " organization			2
when i raise criticism of @entity5 and its targeting of innocent civilians , my comments never register			2
the responses are some variation of " @entity16 has taken over our lands and killed thousands of @entity3 civilians over the years			1
@entity5 is only resisting occupation and fighting for our rights			2
" i hear similar sentiments in @entity22 , @entity23 and even non-arab @entity24			0
@entity25 gives prominence to the popular @entity22 @entity28 cleric @entity27 , who has repeatedly called suicide bombings against @entity16 not terrorism , but " martyrdom			1
" he argues that since @entity16 all serve in the military , they are not civilians			0
even children , he despicably argues , are not innocent			0
they would grow up to serve in the military			0
i can name tens of @entity28 clerics , important formulators of public opinion in a region dominated by religion , that will readily condemn acts of terrorism against the @entity2 , but will fall silent when it comes to condemning @entity5 or @entity47			1
put simply , support for violent resistance against @entity16 among @entity3 and muslim - majority countries -- including allies of the @entity51 such as @entity52 , @entity23 , @entity22 , @entity53 , @entity54 -- remains popular			1
opinion : how this could be the last @entity57 war @entity5 benefits from that support			1
from radical @entity60 to moderate @entity54 , @entity5 ' prime minister @entity59 was welcomed by vast cheering crowds during visits this year			2
in a new @entity63 , where popular opinion matters more than ever before , to demand that people condemn @entity5 is a political nonstarter			1
@entity16 's talk of @entity5 terrorism has failed to convince the @entity28 and @entity3 masses			1
and worse , the label of " terror " loses its importance when entire populations , essentially , see nothing wrong with @entity5 's violent activities			1
in short , @entity16 's strategy has failed to win @entity28 hearts and minds			1
in the long term , it can not continue to rely on military superiority and @entity84 support in the face of popular hostility			0
@entity16 is a nation in the @entity63 , and it needs to find a home and place among its increasingly democratic neighbors			1
the old ideas of " we do not talk to terrorists " are not only strategically futile , but also untrue			0
timeline : @entity16 - @entity57 conflict in order to secure the release of kidnapped @entity16 soldier @entity99 , @entity16 ( in both official and unofficial capacities ) negotiated with @entity5			1
in spite of the @entity103 government 's bluster about refusing to deal with @entity5 now , securing a cease - fire involves doing exactly that with the help of @entity22 's new @entity107 government			2
in the past , @entity16 refused to talk with the @entity108 and @entity109 , and in 1988 , despite @entity16 's intransigence , the @entity51 opened a dialogue with the @entity108 and thereby helped steer the organization to its nonviolent politics today			1
similar examples abound in recent history from @entity116 , where @entity117 once called the @entity118 and @entity120 terrorists , to @entity122 's @entity121			0
opinion : messages of @entity57 violence -- @entity5 ca n't be ignored in short , when the political calculations shift , the actions of terrorists are altered			2
lest we forget , @entity129 was labeled a terrorist by the @entity132			0
but that label carried little weight amid his support base in @entity51			0
today , @entity16 's labels of terrorist mean nothing to the people of the region			1
newly empowered , their views and attitudes matter			0
@entity16 can not continue to swim against the tide			0
for its own security , to strengthen the interests of the @entity51 in the region and to show recognition of the changes that are sweeping the entire @entity63 , @entity16 needs to change			2
it must talk directly with @entity5			0
the old game is over			0
@entity5 is here to stay			0
in 2004 @entity16 killed its founder @entity150 , and then his successor @entity151 and now the head of its military wing , @entity154 , each time vowing to weaken @entity5 , only to see it return stronger			1
those mistakes can not be repeated again			0
to demand that @entity5 abandon violence , change its charter , or recognize @entity16 is not the beginning , but should be the end results of a peace process that builds trust over a period of time			1
to impose these as preconditions and thereby exclude @entity5 , while also neglecting the @entity166 government in the @entity2 , is to give a clear message to @entity3 that no strategy ( that of @entity166 or @entity5 ) is to @entity16 's liking			1
such perceived arrogance further alienates populations in important countries such as @entity53 and @entity22 , not to mention the @entity173			0
the @entity51 needs these newly emerging democracies on its side			0
better relations with 300 million @entity3 helps secure @entity16 too			2
a stronger @entity51 in the region is good news for @entity16			0
a tiny nation of seven million can not be allowed to damage ties between 360 million @entity51 and 300 million @entity3			0
conversely , @entity3 have a duty to recognize @entity16 as home to the children of @entity184 , the descendants of @entity186			2
opinion : @entity16 's mission in @entity57 is not about security across the @entity3 world , from @entity54 to @entity191 , we are witnessing turmoil and the rise of violent @entity196 organizations			1
attacks on @entity51 embassies recently served as a potent reminder of the forces that are being unleashed			0
@entity16 can help itself , its neighbors and the @entity51 by at least ending its old tactics of war and embracing the @entity3 peace plan offered since 2002 by @entity23 and endorsed by the @entity205			1
it is time for @entity16 to act like the democracy it claims to be and end the siege of @entity57 and the occupation of the @entity2 .			2

@entity211 : in @entity63 visits he notes clerics , young @entity3 do n't view @entity5 as terrorist
@entity211 : there 's support for violent resistance against @entity16 among @entity3 , @entity28 countries
he says @entity16 's might wo n't bring peace ; time to make @entity5 part of process
@entity211 : @entity16 should end war tactics , embrace @entity3 peace plan offered since 2002
