chances are , someone you know takes a sleeping pill			1
one in four @entity4 takes a sleep aid every year , according to the @entity6 , and the numbers are even higher for women -- one in three uses some sort of sleep medication a few times a week			1
many sleeping pills stop working after a few hours , and most should not be combined with other medications			1
why do women have such trouble sleeping ? the reasons are as numerous as the passel of pills on the market : anxiety , depression , chronic illness , restless legs syndrome , sleep apnea , everyday exhaustion ... the list goes on and on			1
no wonder so many sleep aids are available			1
but sleeping pills , while often quite helpful , are largely misunderstood			1
many stop working after a few hours , for instance , and most should never be mixed with other meds			2
so if you take one of these drugs now -- or plan to in the future -- there are important questions you need to ask			2
q : how do i know if i need a sleeping pill ? a : more than a third of @entity4 experience occasional insomnia , which is defined as a few nights of restlessness , poor sleep , or trouble falling asleep			1
the general rule of thumb : if insomnia lasts a month and does n't get better , talk to your doctor , says @entity53 , @entity54 , director of the @entity55 at @entity57 - @entity56 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
she may recommend a pill for a short period , but do n't be surprised if she suggests some tests or other non drug treatment options first			0
@entity65 : how much sleep do you need ? for starters , your doc may have you visit a sleep specialist to rule out sleep apnea , a common breathing disorder that wakes sufferers several times a night , sometimes without them even knowing it			1
if you have apnea , you may need a sleeping device that gently forces air into your windpipe			0
if you do n't have apnea , some docs recommend cognitive behavioral therapy : you work with a trained therapist to change how you think about sleep and learn sleep - inducing techniques ( like how to set up your sleep space and what to do before bedtime )			1
some studies say @entity91 is as effective as pills -- if not more -- and has no side effects			1
@entity65 : health risks of snoring and sleep apnea " often people attribute everything bad that happens to them , including being angry and crabby , to lack of sleep , " says @entity97 , @entity98 , clinical director of the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101			1
" it puts such a burden on sleep that not sleeping gets blown out of proportion			1
" @entity91 changes that kind of distorted thinking and in some cases is prescribed along with a pill			0
q : should i try over-the - counter drugs before a prescription pill ? a : many sleep experts are n't fans of @entity119 sleep aids because the meds do n't usually help people with significant insomnia			1
and many -- like @entity124 , simply sleep , @entity125 , and @entity126 -- contain antihistamines ( similar to the allergy medicine @entity129 ) that can have side effects like dry mouth and eyes and next - day grogginess , @entity97 says			1
@entity119 sleep aids are best for people who have occasional sleep problems			1
note : women who breast - feed should avoid them , as should the elderly , who sometimes are more sensitive to the effects of antihistamines			0
q : if i take a prescription pill and still ca n't fall asleep , can i take another ? a : if you 're taking a short - acting drug , such as @entity147 , @entity148 , or @entity149 -- and it 's still early in the evening -- you can take another pill			0
short - acting medications kick in and then fade out , which is why they are prescribed for people who have trouble falling asleep			1
@entity65 : is stress causing your insomnia ? " they last about three or four hours , so you could take another pill up until about 3 a.m. because it would metabolize before you wake up , " says @entity157 , @entity54 , a sleep specialist at @entity159			1
( the timing depends on your sleep schedule , of course , and it 's always wise to check with your doctor , she adds			1
) longer - acting drugs like the time - released @entity149 or @entity167 -- for people who have trouble falling and staying asleep -- should n't be taken more than once a night			1
q : is it safe for me to take a sleeping pill at 11 p.m. if i had a glass of wine or a cocktail around 6 p.m. ? a : it 's probably ok , doctors say , but the sleeping pill wo n't work as well as it should			0
here 's why : " alcohol becomes a stimulant about three to four hours after you drink it , so you 're actually working against your sleep medication , " @entity97 says			1
" it 's a terrible combination			0
" never drink and then immediately take a sleep aid			1
why ? alcohol acts like a sedative at first , so you 'd essentially be getting a double dose of sedatives			1
this can dangerously slow your heart rate and lead to dizziness , fainting , and shallow breathing , which can deprive your body of oxygen and damage brain cells			0
worst case : you may even stop breathing altogether			0
@entity65 : 11 kinds of insomnia because everyone metabolizes food and alcohol at different rates , there are no safety absolutes when it comes to the minimum number of hours you should wait between consuming alcohol and taking a sleeping pill , experts say			2
" but if you 're at a dinner party and really want a drink , have the alcohol early , " @entity157 says			1
" then eat dessert without any alcohol and wait as long as possible before taking your sleeping pill			2
" q : can sleeping pills give me nightmares ? a : not usually , @entity97 says , " but some sleep meds can suppress dream recall			1
" when you stop taking them , the dreams ( and possibly nightmares ) may return			0
the mechanism is n't fully understood , but once there 's a withdrawal -- even just when the dosage wears off during the night -- vivid dreams can occur			0
q : can i safely take sleeping pills for several months ? a : there are no known long - term health risks with most sleep aids , but some are more addictive than others			1
" the newer medications like @entity149 , @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity167 have been approved by the @entity243 without a limit on how long they can be prescribed , " @entity97 says			0
" they have a small addiction potential , and some have been shown to be effective up to one year			2
" the older sleeping pills with @entity250 ( @entity250 ) and pentobarbital ( @entity252 ) pose a much higher risk of addiction			2
tolerance is a common problem with all sleeping pills : after taking them for a while , you need more than the usual dose to help you sleep , which may lead you to think you 're addicted			1
if the drug does n't seem to be working as well as it used to or if you 're taking more than your prescribed dosage , tell your doctor ; she can change or adjust your medication			0
q : i 've been taking sleeping pills for several months			2
what 's the best way to wean myself off ? a : with your doctor 's help , gradually step down your meds			0
generally , you want to reduce drugs by one clinical dose per week : if you 're taking 10 milligrams of traditional @entity149 a night , start taking 5 mg a night for a week , @entity97 recommends			0
next , cut that pill in half and take that amount for a week			0
then , stop taking the drug altogether			0
medications in pill ( not capsule ) form that are n't time - release versions are ok to split			0
( you can split @entity149 , for instance , but not @entity149			0
) q : i 've heard of rebound insomnia			0
is it really harder to fall asleep and stay asleep without pills if i 've taken them a few times ? a : you might have some trouble , @entity157 says , though it 's less likely with the newer pills -- these include @entity148 , @entity147 , and @entity167			2
" give it a few days to adjust after you stop taking the medication , " @entity97 explains			0
if you still ca n't sleep , talk to your physician			2
rebound insomnia is one of the reasons some experts recommend @entity91 over sleep medications			2
q : if i do n't want to use sleeping pills , are natural remedies worth trying ? a : yes , but do n't expect miracles			2
melatonin , a sleep hormone your body makes naturally , and the herb valer Â­ ian may be helpful ( both are available at drugstores ) , but some experts feel there 's a lack of research to back up the effectiveness of these supplements			2
plus , they 're not regulated like drugs , so you do n't always know what you 're getting			0
that said , if you want to try melatonin , take 0.2 to 1 mg about four hours before bedtime : " it 's safe to take every day , " @entity157 says			0
" as we age , our bodies secrete less of it , so taking a supplement can be helpful			0
" melatonin may be particularly beneficial when you travel several time zones to the east ( like @entity339 ) and have trouble falling asleep			0
as for valerian , there 's no recommended dosage , and it 's not clear how the herb works			2
before using any supplement , check with your doctor ; combining them with other medications -- sleeping pills or otherwise -- can be risky			2
