@entity0 , @entity1 -- the war over women arrived in @entity1 this week -- in the form of a press release			0
" @entity13 @entity12 's @entity11 and @entity14 , " reporters were informed tuesday morning by email , just hours before sen. @entity9 was to host a women 's - themed campaign event in @entity0			1
@entity9 's ad is a brutal one -- particularly against someone who is a self - proclaimed " pro-choice independent @entity17			1
" in ominous tones , the ad reveals that when he was a state legislator in @entity21 , the state @entity12 used to live in and later represented in the @entity22 , he backed a bill that would " force women considering abortion to look at color photographs of developing fetuses			1
" though democrats in tough races nationwide have been running on women 's issues for the better part of a year , the message had not taken center stage in @entity1 's @entity22 race until this week			2
the shift foreshadows what could be a rough and tumble end to election season in this typically tranquil @entity41 state			0
@entity12 is less vulnerable to the " war on women " attack than other down - the - line conservative @entity17 -- one reason the issue is only now surfacing in the race			1
beyond his pro-choice stance , he has broken with his party by supporting the @entity51 and funding for @entity53			2
but @entity9 's new offensive struck a nerve , forcing @entity12 to throw together a slapdash press conference to respond to her " despicable attacks			1
" he was thrown off - message on a day when he was supposed to be talking about foreign policy and tying @entity9 to president @entity60 and his in - the - dumps poll numbers			1
the next morning , @entity12 went up with a defensive television ad stressing his support for abortion rights and accusing the senator of running a " smear campaign			1
" @entity9 , a cunning , no - holds - barred campaigner despite her pleasant demeanor , is leaving nothing to chance as she clings to a steady single - digit lead in a treacherous political environment for @entity29			2
in the latest poll of the race this week , from @entity76 and the @entity77 , @entity9 led @entity12 by 6 points , but she was topping out at 47 % : the under - 50 danger zone for any incumbent			1
but she has a healthy 15 - point advantage among likely women voters , and is doing everything she can to keep it that way			0
" you get the sense this race could turn at just a moment 's notice , " said @entity85 , the always - on political director at @entity87 television station @entity76			0
@entity85 was joining me for a slice of pepperoni at @entity96 in @entity0 for this week 's episode of " @entity98			0
" " the race seems to be primed for that , " @entity85 said			0
" it gets all the attention in this state			0
this state has got four major races			0
we have two congressional races and a competitive governor 's race			0
but all people talk about is @entity111 , every single day			0
" at her lone campaign event tuesday , inside a @entity0 - based food incubator called @entity113 , @entity9 rattled through a laundry list of female - focused issues she supports â € ” equal pay , access to contraception , abortion rights â € ” as a small crowd of women nodded in approval			1
the message was heavy - handed and impossible to miss , but @entity9 put an exclamation point on it just in case : " @entity12 , " she said , " is being disingenuous when he says he is pro-choice			1
" reporters surrounded her after her appearance			0
one asked her why she waited until october to thrust women 's issues into the campaign , using " probably the most negative ad of the campaign			1
" @entity9 has highlighted the topic before , memorably in july , after @entity12 hid in a restaurant bathroom when a reporter asked him about the @entity140 's controversial decision in @entity141 vs. @entity142 that allowed corporations to deny birth control coverage in their insurance plans			1
but her campaign had not put money behind a television ad on women 's health before , particularly such a blistering one			2
" i think this is something that we planned to talk about all along , " @entity9 responded			2
" i think access to health care , access to reproductive choice is critical to women			0
i 've worked on it my entire career			0
this is an issue that is important to women and families			0
ninety - nine percent of women use contraceptives at some point in their lives			0
" then i asked @entity9 about @entity12 's topic of choice : president @entity60 , whose disapproval ratings in @entity1 approach 60 %			1
what is it about him , exactly , that @entity29 are so wary of ? @entity9 would rather not talk about @entity60 , which is why @entity12 spent their first one - on - one debate on monday reminding voters that the senator has voted with the president " 99 % of the time			1
" it 's one reason he has seized on the ascendancy of @entity185 , the terrorist group roiling @entity186 and @entity187 , and border security			0
national security is becoming a winning talking point , @entity17 operatives here argue , claiming it scores points among the very women @entity9 is trying to keep in her fold			1
" there is a leadership void , " @entity12 said at an event tuesday in @entity0 , where he was joined by @entity199 sen. @entity198 , a foreign policy hawk and potential presidential candidate in 2016			2
" our allies do n't trust us , and our foes do n't fear or respect us			0
" like @entity17 candidates across the country , @entity12 wants the race to be about national issues			1
@entity9 does not , so she brings up another sore point for @entity12 : his decision to sell his home in @entity21 last year and move to the @entity1 to run for @entity22			1
@entity12 is not exactly a carpetbagger -- he 's long owned property in @entity1 and many thousands of people have moved here from somewhere else thanks to the low tax rates â € ” but it 's still a reliable campaign jab			1
" this race is not about president @entity60 , " @entity9 said			2
" this race is about @entity12 and me			2
i know that @entity12 would like to be running against the president , because he has not done anything in @entity1 , he does n't have a history here , he just moved here			2
i have spent my entire professional life here in @entity1			0
