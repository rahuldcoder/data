-- all athletes have ups and downs in their career , but few have touched the troughs that @entity7 has experienced			1
having topped the tennis rankings , winning @entity9 five times and her home @entity12 twice , she has had to rebuild her career after succumbing to injuries and a debilitating autoimmune disease			0
but those rocky moments are providing a powerful motivation for the 33 - year - old			1
" i have to say i feel more confident on the court than i have in my life , " @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity19 ahead of the @entity20 which starts wednesday			1
" i think it 's because i have really been to the bottom , so once you get that far down and you get back up , you realize you really have nothing to lose			1
" not since 2008 , when she won her seventh grand slam on the grass courts of @entity9 , has @entity7 tasted success at the sport 's biggest events			1
she has struggled since being diagnosed with @entity32 -- an autoimmune disorder which causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels -- which she revealed publicly when pulling out during the @entity36			0
by the end of that year she had plummeted outside the top 100 in the world rankings and faded into the background as her sister @entity41 -- who had to recover from potentially fatal blood clots on the lungs -- strengthened her reputation as the leading force in women 's tennis			1
while @entity41 has now won 17 grand slam titles , @entity7 has fought a very difficult battle -- coming to terms with her new condition , while trying to compete at the highest levels of the sport			1
her hard work was last month rewarded in @entity55 , where she collected the 45th @entity57 title of her career and helped to quash doubts over her ability to compete against the very best			2
a new vegan diet and an inexhaustible determination to overcome the syndrome has breathed new life into her tennis			2
such is @entity7 ' confidence that she has already set her sights on competing at the @entity68 in @entity69			1
now ranked 31st , she has a special relationship with the @entity71 , having won four gold medals including the singles title in 2000			2
the other three came after teaming up with her sister at @entity75 , @entity76 and most recently , @entity77 two years ago			0
and while the calling of the @entity79 may be some way down the line , @entity7 is adamant she 'll be ready for @entity82			2
" the @entity83 have been the most special moment for me and @entity41 in our lives , " she said			0
" playing doubles as well has been amazing			0
i get to play with my sister and we get along and support each other			0
" so the @entity83 is definitely on our radar			0
it 's only a couple of years away -- we think we can get there			0
