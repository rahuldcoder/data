-- indecisive foodies have another tool to help them find top - notch eating and drinking destinations			0
@entity4 on monday overhauled the @entity6 website and released new , free @entity6 mobile apps for @entity8 and @entity9			1
until now , @entity6 required people to login to access the reviews			1
with this overhaul , @entity4 is making @entity6 content free and accessible to everyone without having to sign up			1
@entity4 purchased the restaurant - review company in 2011 and added its database of reviews to existing @entity4 services like @entity19 and @entity20 in 2012			1
zagat ratings score dining , hotel and other entertainment venues on a scale of one to 30			2
they have n't replaced @entity4 's own @entity28 - like scoring system , which assigns locations a one - to five - star rating based on user reviews in @entity20			1
those scores currently show up in @entity34 search results			0
@entity6 competes with other review databases such as @entity28 and @entity36			2
unlike those crowd - sourced rankings , @entity6 still relies on a slightly older , less - freewheeling model			2
it collects information about the places it rates using surveys and then tallies the results for the final scores			0
the new @entity6 has four categories of content			2
there are listings for individual places that bear the familiar one - paragraph summary and ratings for food , decor , service and an average cost			0
there is also original content put together by local editors in the form of lists , blog posts ( called " buzz " ) and videos			0
the revamped @entity6 site and apps only cover restaurants and nightlife in nine cities to start , but @entity4 says it will add 50 locations in the coming months			1
it also plans to add in results for other types of destinations , including stores , hotels and places of interest			0
for now , anyone living in or visiting @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 or @entity87 can use the tools to choose an adventure .			0
