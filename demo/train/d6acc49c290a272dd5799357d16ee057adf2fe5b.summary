-- @entity4 president @entity3 bears at least some responsibility for the shooting down of @entity7 , former @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 said friday			1
" i think if there were any doubt it should be gone by now , that @entity3 , certainly indirectly -- through his support of the insurgents in eastern @entity15 and the supply of advanced weapons and , frankly , the presence of @entity19 and intelligence agents -- bears responsibility for what happened , " she told @entity0 's @entity11 in an exclusive interview that will air sunday			1
@entity24 's comments come just over a week since @entity25 crashed in eastern @entity15 , killing all 298 on board			2
pro-russian militants have been accused of downing the plane using @entity4 - supplied armaments and of interfering with the subsequent investigation at the crash site			2
who are @entity15 's @entity34 rebels ? @entity2 president @entity37 last week called the crash a " wake - up call for @entity36 and the world that there are consequences to an escalating conflict in eastern @entity15 , " a view @entity24 echoed in urging @entity36 to go further			1
" we have to up the sanctions that are required			2
the @entity2 has continued to move forward on that , @entity36 has been reluctant , " @entity24 told			1
" they need to understand they must stand up to @entity3			1
" her comments came as the @entity52 warned that @entity4 is preparing to transfer more powerful weaponry into @entity15 , a move it said could happen at any time			2
@entity3 has argued that @entity15 bears significant responsibility , saying in a statement that if military operations had not resumed in eastern @entity15 on june 28 , " this tragedy probably could have been avoided			1
" however , @entity24 joined a chorus of @entity62 voices laying much of the blame at @entity65 's door , and she lamented that the @entity2 and @entity36 had been " disabused " of their earlier hopes over the so - called reset in @entity2 - @entity4 relations that was announced during president @entity37 's first year in office			1
" @entity73 [ @entity3 ] has a strategic plan in mind , the @entity76 , which would be in competition to @entity36 , " @entity24 said			1
" his continuing efforts to intimidate @entity36 -- not just through energy , but through interfering in elections , putting money behind buying press outlets in @entity36 countries ... trying to discourage countries like @entity15 being able to join the @entity85			1
" how rebels in @entity15 built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies " and if the @entity2 and @entity36 do n't present a united front , i think @entity3 is the kind of man who will go as far as he can get away with			1
i think he is still smart enough and cautious enough to be pushed back			0
but there has to be a push in order to make that happen			0
" ' he 's a very arrogant person to deal with ' @entity24 also shared her thoughts on her interactions with @entity3 during her stint as @entity37 's secretary of state			1
" he 's very tough			0
he 's a very arrogant person to deal with , which i think is a combination of this vision of @entity4 and some fundamental insecurity , because when you are dealing with him , he often acts as though he could care less , " @entity24 said			1
" ... there was a @entity111 summit in @entity112 ( @entity113 , in 2012 ) and our president had a meeting scheduled			0
he kept president @entity37 waiting 40 minutes before he showed up			0
it was a very small meeting on both sides of the table			0
we , at the time , were very hopeful -- not realistically so , but idealistically so -- that we could get more cooperation from @entity4 to slow down ( @entity125 ) @entity124 and what he was doing in @entity127 , " she said			0
" @entity3 could not have looked more bored , more discomfited , and never apologized for being late			1
" " so then , of course , he wanted a summit in @entity4			0
he wanted to play the host			0
and my advice to the president was do n't go chasing after him			0
we 're not sure of what his real intent is			0
" opinion : @entity3 , just evil enough has @entity139 committed war crimes ? in a wide - ranging interview , @entity24 also discussed the ongoing violence in @entity143 as @entity139 's ground incursion entered its second week			1
asked about the warning wednesday by @entity147 @entity146 that war crimes may have been committed , and whether @entity139 has used excessive force , @entity24 said she did not agree with the war crimes assessment			1
" i think that the @entity139 are in a very difficult position			1
@entity154 , we know , embeds missiles , embeds command - and - control units in civilian areas , " she said			0
" now , some of that is just the geography			0
it 's a very small area , very densely populated			0
but some of that is a deliberate choice by @entity154			0
" however , she said , " too many people have died and too many of them are clearly innocent civilians , even children			0
" opinion : war crimes in @entity143 conflict ? let court decide more than 800 people have been killed in the more than two weeks of violence in @entity143 , as diplomats scramble to establish a ceasefire			1
@entity176 leaders called for a day of rage as protests erupted in the @entity179 following a strike this week on a @entity147 shelter			0
@entity139 's security cabinet on friday unanimously rejected a proposed one - week humanitarian ceasefire , @entity139 intelligence minister @entity182 told @entity0			2
secretary of state @entity185 said later that there was a framework for a cease - fire , but that more needed to be done to make it happen			2
" they [ the @entity139 ] understand the terrible box that they find themselves in because they want to end the rockets			2
and unfortunately , since the last ceasefire , the @entity154 leadership has felt cornered			0
and the only way out of that corner , in their opinion , was to get better , more accurate , longer range rockets			0
" and they 've been digging tunnels , apparently constantly , that can come up inside @entity139 territory			2
and the @entity139 have a perfectly legitimate objective to try to destroy as much as of the rocketry as they can and to destroy the tunnels			2
" @entity139 security cabinet rejects one - week @entity209 cease - fire how do we get a cease - fire to end the bloodshed in @entity143 ? watch @entity213 at 10am and 1pm et. for the latest from @entity213 click here .			1
