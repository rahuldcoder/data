-- liberals need to stop complaining about the right			2
in recent weeks , the chorus of criticism emanating from liberals has been intensifying , focusing on how right - wing @entity6 have shut down the government and are threatening the global economy			1
many observers agree with this criticism , including a number of @entity6 who are also frustrated with their own party			1
a recent @entity15 poll showed that support for the @entity6 has plummeted since september			1
but simply criticizing congressional intransigence never goes very far in @entity19 politics			0
liberals who rail against the right are unlikely to accomplish much			1
the 40 or so conservative @entity6 who have been controlling the @entity24 do n't really care what liberals in @entity19 have to say			1
even if some @entity24 @entity6 politicians are listening to their critics , most of the short - term electoral incentives are pushing them in a different direction than @entity32 hope			1
if liberals want to bring change and truly alter the political dynamics in @entity19 , they are going to need to build grass - roots pressure to shape national debate and genuine electoral pressure in the states and districts of @entity6 who are not among the hard - core of the right - wing -- still a majority of the @entity6			1
political scientist @entity45 estimates that there are 48 republicans in the " fearful caucus , " who are not in the hard " no " faction but whose primary concern is being at risk in a primary challenge			0
there are 29 republicans who are loyal to the @entity24 leadership , and 17 more in districts won by president @entity58 who are interested in a compromise			2
thus far , it has been striking during the federal government shutdown to see the relative inaction of the left in terms of mounting actual grass - roots pressure on legislators to reopen the government , raise the debt ceiling and deal with budgetary disputes through the normal paths of the legislative process			2
although the budgetary process is not an issue that has the same urgency as immigration reform or climate change , the stakes of continuing with this kind of budget politics are enormously consequential			0
the more that @entity6 can normalize the decision to shut down the federal government , the more comfortable they will be in disputes to do this again			1
if they are willing to go to the length of actually sending the government into default over health care , they will use this kind of threat in future policy disputes			0
republicans , to some extent , are comfortable with this outcome			0
they have been warning about the ills of government for decades , so this kind of breakdown fits well within their broader narrative			0
liberals need government to work , as they believe that government is an essential part of a fair and just society			2
in the past , liberals have scored their biggest breakthroughs against congressional conservatism through grass - roots pressure			1
between the late 1930s and the early 1960s , a conservative alliance of @entity32 and @entity111 @entity6 held up progress on legislation meant to benefit african - americans , union members and @entity116 living in the cities			1
since @entity32 chaired many of the major committees , they were able to prevent bills from coming up for a vote or they forced legislation to be so watered down by the time of passage that it was ineffective			0
in the @entity126 , they could use the filibuster on bills such as civil rights to ensure that bold measures did not come up for a vote			0
during the early 1960s , liberals were finally able to break the hold of this conservative coalition through a massive and dramatic grass - roots mobilization , spearheaded by the civil rights movement			2
this changed national opinion and created electoral pressure on @entity111 republicans to break ranks with their @entity143 counterparts			2
during the 1980s , liberals faced similar problems			2
after the 1980 election , president @entity146 allied with the newly @entity6 @entity126 and an expanded conservative coalition in the @entity24 to push through major legislation , such as the historic tax cut of 1981 , that took away revenue the federal government badly needed and made the tax code less progressive			1
@entity146 also obtained a huge increase in the defense budget and undertook an aggressive shift in foreign policy that heightened tensions with the @entity159			0
his team avoided negotiations with the @entity159 and insisted on a build - up of intercontinental missiles in @entity164			0
when @entity146 proposed cuts to @entity167 in 1981 , @entity24 @entity32 worked with organizations and citizen groups allied with the elderly to stop this in its tracks			0
during the 1982 midterms , liberals focused on " fairness " in the economy and blamed @entity146 's policies for the economic recession			0
in 1983 and 1984 , the millions of @entity116 involved in the nuclear freeze movement generated immense support for the need to reduce international tensions and created the framework for negotiations that started in 1985 when @entity185 emerged on the scene			0
a new book by historian @entity188 , " @entity189 , " shows how grass - roots activists in this period participated in a wide range of protests on issues such as industrial policies for depressed areas to gay rights			0
liberals have an opportunity to influence the political debate			0
an unusual alliance is possible			0
first , liberals will find support from republicans who care about the party 's national standing and are unhappy with the polls reflecting the public 's discontent with @entity24 @entity6 tactics			1
second , a growing number of leaders in the business community are starting to consider the possibility of funding primary challengers to hard - right @entity6 whose policy demands are threatening the economy			1
but liberals will have to be part of the equation of isolating the far right politically by building pressure in swing states , generating support for @entity32 who push back against these kinds of tactics , staging protests , holding marches and meeting with constituents in states where @entity6 politicians will feel pressed to moderate the ways of their party			1
conservatives have been quick to turn to protest politics , such as the recent protests at @entity19 monuments , so there is no reason liberals should be hesitant to do the same , although they will need to do so on a much larger scale			1
without that kind of grass - roots pressure from liberals , the current stalemate is likely to be the new normal			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			2

@entity248 : @entity251 complaints about the tactics of the right accomplish nothing
he says liberals should be looking for ways to pressure @entity6 members in their districts
if @entity6 can normalize shutdowns , it will use tactic again and again , he says
@entity248 : moderate @entity6 might help push back against conservatives
