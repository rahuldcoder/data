@entity0 -- we were somewhere down @entity3 in the back half of october 1996			2
i believe we were in a theater			2
i remember thinking how terrible the lighting was , how small and deflated the crowd			0
i remember the look on the candidate 's face			0
@entity13 presidential candidate @entity12 was on stage with @entity15 , the first deaf @entity16			1
she signed , " i love you " to the crowd			0
then he signed it , too			0
they said what they were supposed to say , but there was something wordless encapsulated in that moment			0
i remember for the first time thinking , " @entity12 knows he 's going to lose			1
" i have covered campaigns since 1984			0
it is the losing ones i remember most			0
sure , @entity12 had been the consistent underdog in his bid to unseat then - president @entity33			1
but politicians are like gamblers , wired to believe they will beat the odds			1
unlike gamblers , though , when presidential nominees run out of chips , they ca n't fold and go home			1
@entity41 : what it 's like to lose an election as it turns out , late october is about when @entity12 and company knew the game was lost but not over			1
one top aide tells stories of a dispirited @entity12 who said during a @entity52 swing that he was done and wanted to go home			1
the source says @entity12 was eventually persuaded to keep moving with a nonstop , cross-country trek to gin up some campaign excitement and try to help down - ballot @entity13			1
but a senior @entity12 strategist told me this week that it was the candidate 's idea to lead this last hurrah			1
' @entity62 says it all about the man ' " we knew we were going to lose ... and @entity12 came up with the selfless idea to do the 96 - hour fly - around and to help save the @entity67			1
@entity62 says it all about the man			0
" the result was a 96 - hour victory tour			2
staff wore 96 - hour victory t - shirts , and the press received caps that read " 96 hours until the @entity76			2
" we flew crazily around the country , visited bowling alleys and diners in the dead of night , @entity81 and factories by day , interrupted by " hygiene stops " at various hotels			0
it all led to a final sentimental stop in @entity12 's hometown of @entity88 , @entity89 , where he voted on @entity90			1
the @entity91 and @entity92 stayed in @entity13 hands			0
it was perhaps some solace for @entity12 , who exited the political scene on november 5 , 1996			1
he opened his @entity90 speech in typically wry , painfully truthful fashion : " i was thinking on the way down in the elevator -- tomorrow will be the first time in my life i do n't have anything to do			0
" politics : @entity104 trails in states with personal ties flash forward 12 years			2
sen. @entity107 , of a different generation but like @entity12 an old warrior , knew his political battle was lost as early as mid-september , according to former top aide @entity111			1
" with the ' ( on the ) right track ' number in the country dropping to 6 % and the stock market diving , we were the incumbent party			0
the blame would default to the @entity13			0
we knew at that point it was not survivable			2
" in contrast to the @entity12 campaign , losing was never spoken about out loud in @entity123			1
" i never said anything to him , " @entity111 says , " and he never said anything to me , but everyone was reality - based			2
" there was never a question in the @entity107 camp that the candidate would be out there fighting until the end of what everyone knew was coming			1
anything less than a full - on effort can shave a point or two off the percentages of down - ballot candidates			1
however long a candidate or his staff has to prepare mentally for defeat , it is still a blow of surprising proportions			2
those who have been through it liken it to having a terminally ill loved one -- you know what 's coming , but it does n't help			0
opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 ' we lost			0
it 's so hard ' @entity111 describes @entity90 with @entity107 like this : " when you are at that moment in the suite ' we lost @entity164			1
' you know it 's over			0
" in a graceful concession speech bowing to the sweep of history , @entity107 congratulated the nation 's first @entity174 - @entity173 president and told his supporters that " we fought as hard as we could			1
and though we fell short , the failure is mine , not yours			1
" if there is something worse than campaigning for weeks without hope , it may be losing in overtime			0
@entity185 won the popular vote and lost the electoral vote in a presidential election ultimately untangled 35 days later with a controversial @entity190 decision			0
@entity185 yielded , saying while he disagreed with the court , he accepted the decision " for the sake of unity of the people and the strength of our democracy , i offer my concession			0
" four years later , @entity200 went to bed in @entity202 on @entity90 believing that @entity164 absentee votes would make him the president			1
it was clear by morning he was wrong			2
politics : if @entity104 wins ... elated by early exit polling on @entity90 , @entity207 was both stunned and devastated			2
but the candidate insisted he did n't want to drag things out since there was no chance of winning : he ended his campaign at @entity214 in @entity202 just hours after a meeting of close aides			0
" i 'm sorry , " he told the crowd , " that we got here a little bit late and a little bit short			2
" people often say that candidates seem different -- better , bigger , more likable in their goodbye moments than at any point in the election process			0
@entity200 was seen as removed , unemotional and often peeved to be so challenged by a man he did n't believe should be president			1
there was none of that in his parting words : " i wish that things had turned out a little differently			0
but in an @entity173 election , there are no losers , because whether or not our candidates are successful , the next morning we all wake up as @entity173			1
" politics : if @entity239 wins ... @entity240 , shoulda , wouldas and a world of hurt as poetic and gracious as the losers generally are , there is bitterness over the slash - and - burn nature of campaigns that lasts for years , anger over lost moments , frustration over coulda , shoulda , wouldas and a world of hurt			1
one source in a losing campaign called the concession speech " the highest point of acting , but the lowest point of sincerity			0
" still , they do seem different at the end , maybe because it 's not about them			0
the finale of a losing campaign might be acting on the personal level , but it 's real democracy on a grand scale			0
in saluting @entity12 , @entity185 , @entity200 and @entity107 , @entity111 explains , " you have people who were all senators deeply rooted in the best aspects of that institution , duty - bound to play their part in ensuring a smooth and peaceful transition of power			1
" think about it -- the first person who addresses the winner as mr. president - elect is the loser			2
it is the loser who offers the first legitimization of the election with a concession speech , beginning a series of events that ends in the swearing - in of a president in january			2
@entity104 's vision for @entity173 @entity293 is easy in the winning			1
in some ways , democracy shines most in the losing			0
@entity239 's vision for @entity173			1

politicians are like gamblers , wired to think they can beat the odds
@entity12 knew he would lose but went on *marathon* to help down - ballot *republicans*
four years *ago* , @entity107 told supporters , " the failure is mine , not yours "
@entity200 in defeat : " ... the next morning , we all wake up as @entity173 "
