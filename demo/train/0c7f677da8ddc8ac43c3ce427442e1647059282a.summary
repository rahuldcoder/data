@entity0 -- three @entity3 congressmen from @entity4 are calling for the @entity5 to immediately reopen a slaughterhouse closed this week after videos showed what the agency called " disturbing evidence of inhumane treatment of cattle			1
" the videos , shot by an undercover activist and posted online tuesday by the organization @entity15 , show animals at the @entity18 , @entity4 - based @entity17 being repeatedly shot with a bolt gun			2
another is shown suffocated and others are seen hanging from a single hind leg while apparently still alive			0
" while some of the footage provided from this facility shows unacceptable treatment of cattle , it does not show anything that would compromise food safety , " a @entity5 statement sent to @entity1 by spokeswoman @entity23 said			1
" we are aggressively continuing our investigation			0
@entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 wrote secretary of agriculture @entity40 on thursday to urge the reopening of the plant because its closure caused " enormous economic stress in a community with double digit unemployment			1
" they called on the @entity5 to reopen the plant immediately and quickly deploy additional agency staff to make sure the slaughterhouse meets appropriate regulations			1
" this area and these families can not take this plant being closed , " @entity37 , who represents the district where many of the 500 slaughterhouse employees live , told @entity1 in an interview			2
" this is going to devastate many families who are already on the brink			0
" in recent years , the area around @entity18 , about 30 miles south of @entity63 , has seen home values plummet and unemployment rates reach as high as 20 % , according to @entity37			0
@entity66 , president of the @entity17 , on tuesday called the reports of inhumane treatment " disturbing and surprising			1
" " our company seeks to not just meet federal humane handling regulations , but to exceed them , " @entity66 said in a statement			2
he said federal inspectors continuously inspect the plant and are able to take action if they see a problem			0
" that is why these allegations are both disturbing and surprising , " he said			0
the company has submitted a plan required for reopening the plant to the @entity5 , @entity37 said , and he hopes the agency will approve it soon			1
" @entity5 is reviewing the corrective action plan to ensure that it would comply with humane handling regulations before the facility is allowed to resume operations , " agency spokesman @entity84 told @entity1 in a statement			1
when asked for his reaction to the images in the videos , @entity37 replied : " it 's a tough business			2
killing animals is not an easy business			0
the key point here is to make sure that everything is investigated and if any laws were broken			0
" in the letter , the congressmen also note the @entity5 had inspectors at the plant during the time the video was shot , yet " despite their active presence through out the facility at the time there is no record of non-compliance			1
" @entity111 , a 50 - year - old company , was one of the beef suppliers for @entity115 , a well - known fast food chain predominantly in @entity4 and the @entity117			0
@entity118 , chief operating officer for @entity115 , said wednesday that the chain has stopped doing business with @entity111			0
" @entity115 would never condone the inhumane treatment of animals , and all of our suppliers must agree to abide by our strict standards for the humane treatment of cattle , " he said in a statement .			1
