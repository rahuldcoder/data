@entity0 -- the @entity3 attorney general is trying to prevent immigration authorities from sending a @entity6 woman to her home country , where she was a victim of female genital mutilation			1
attorney general @entity9 ordered an immigration court to reconsider an @entity13 woman 's case			1
in a stinging order overriding federal immigration courts , @entity9 blasted a decision that said a 28 - year - old citizen and native of @entity19 should be expelled " because her genitalia already had been mutilated [ so ] she had no basis to fear future persecution if returned to her home country			1
" calling the rationale " flawed , " @entity9 sent the case back to the @entity25 with orders to reconsider			1
the woman , a native of @entity19 , begged the court not to send her back to her @entity30 tribe			1
the 28 - year - old said if she returned and had a daughter , the child also would be subject to mutilation			2
the woman also said she faced forced marriage if she had to go home			0
@entity9 cited what he concluded were two significant factual errors in the court 's rejection of her appeal			1
" female genital mutilation is not necessarily a one - time event , " @entity9 said			2
he noted that the board in a previous case had granted asylum in to one woman whose " vaginal opening was sewn shut approximately five times after being opened to allow for sexual intercourse and child birth			0
" he also concluded that the @entity25 was wrong to assume that the woman " must fear persecution in exactly the same form [ namely , repeat female genital mutilation ] to qualify for relief			0
" @entity9 had been urged to look into the matter by angered members of @entity61 in the wake of the january decision			0
" this recent action taken by the @entity25 is a step backward for the rights of women worldwide , " declared rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , in a january letter			0
" female genital mutilation is a gross violation of a woman 's human rights and has traditionally been grounds for the granting of an asylum claim , " rep. @entity71 , @entity72 , said in the letter			1
@entity81 chairman @entity80 , @entity82 , issued a statement applauding @entity9 's action , and declaring female genital mutilation a " barbaric practice widely regarded as a human rights abuse			2
" the @entity88 acknowledged it is extraordinarily rare for an attorney general to jump into a relatively low - level immigration case			1
the immigration courts decide about 40,000 cases a year , and an attorney general has issued an opinion on a case only three times in the past three years			2
female genital mutilation is common in parts of @entity13 , @entity99 and in some @entity101 countries , according to the @entity102			0
the operation is viewed by some ethnic groups as a means to control a woman 's sexuality and is sometimes a prerequisite for marriage or the right to inherit			0
the procedure can cause tissue injury , severe infection and fever , among other complications			0
the @entity102 has recorded cases in which hemorrhaging and infection lead to death .			0

@entity120 *ruled* that because woman already had surgery , she should not get asylum
in rare move , attorney general said court 's ruling was " flawed "
@entity9 ordered court to reconsider its ruling
@entity19 woman said she fears any daughter she had would be subject to mutilation
