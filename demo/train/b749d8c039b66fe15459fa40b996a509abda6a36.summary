@entity0 -- when @entity5 's decades - long rule came to an end in february , @entity3 's @entity2 was a scene of jubilation , as hundreds of thousands of people celebrated the fall of a man many had feared for years			1
today the square is once again a focal point for unrest and anger at the @entity17 regime , and the site of a bloody crackdown on demonstrations			1
so what has happened to change the mood of the country so dramatically ? why are @entity17 no longer satisfied with the revolution they helped bring about ? how was @entity5 ousted ? after more than 30 years in power , @entity5 was forced to step down as president on february 11 , 2011 following weeks of rioting and unrest across the country			1
what had begun as a protest over unemployment , poverty and repression became a widespread popular uprising , with hundreds of thousands of people staging mass demonstrations in @entity3 , @entity38 , @entity39 and elsewhere			1
after resigning and handing control of the country to the military , @entity5 retreated to the @entity44 resort of @entity45 , where he was subsequently detained by the authorities who is running the country now ? in the wake of @entity5 's departure , @entity17 's military dissolved the country 's parliament and suspended the constitution in its place , a council of generals -- the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) -- led by former defense minister @entity58 @entity57 , took charge			1
they promised new elections for the country 's houses of parliament and for the presidency			2
following the resignation of prime minister @entity69 in march , @entity67 was named as his replacement at the head of a new caretaker cabinet charged with paving the way for a new civilian government			0
but for many , the pace of reform in the months since revolution has been too slow			2
" the situation has become increasingly tense , " said dr @entity78 , @entity17 expert and associate fellow at @entity0 - based international affairs think - tank @entity80			2
" there is a growing perception that the military , the @entity55 , was the backbone of the previous regime , and that it is , in effect , a continuation of that regime			0
" what about the cabinet ? prime minister @entity67 and members of the @entity95 handed in their resignations on monday night in response to the military 's crackdown on demonstrators			1
" we have met the demands of the people and submitted our resignations , " @entity67 said , according to @entity17 's @entity101 , before urging the protesters to remain calm and return home			1
" now please put the interests of the country first			0
" " i resigned because of the events in @entity2 [ @entity2 ] , because of the political responsibility , " culture minister @entity109 told @entity110			2
on tuesday , @entity57 announced that the mass resignation had been accepted , and that another caretaker government would be put in place ahead of the upcoming elections			0
why has trouble flared now ? more than nine months on from @entity5 's overthrow , many of the things the country 's revolutionaries fought against remain : the country is , in effect , a dictatorship , elections have yet to take place , and protesters fear the military will not give up its hold on power easily			1
" there has been a build - up of grievances , because of the heavy - handedness of the military regime in dealing with the protesters , " said @entity78			0
" the hope was that with the @entity5 regime gone there would be freedom of assembly , freedom of speech , that the emergency laws would be repealed and that there would be no more human rights abuses			2
" but in the last few months we have seen 12,000 people subjected to military trials , protesters have been subject to crackdowns , workers have been denied the right to hold sit - ins			1
" many are also angry at proposed changes to the country 's constitution , which would protect the military 's budget from scrutiny			1
@entity78 says the @entity55 " may have gone too far " with its plans for constitutional change , which she says aim to protect it from accountability , and maintain the " opaqueness " surrounding its dealings			0
does @entity5 still have influence ? @entity5 is currently on trial for corruption and the deaths of more than 800 people killed during the protests in january , and his influence on the country has waned as a result			1
but high on the list of protesters ' concerns is the fact that many members of the @entity55 were close allies of the former president : the head of the @entity55 , @entity57 , served as @entity5 's defense minister			1
" what we 're seeing is a standoff between the population and the opposition , and the military , " said @entity78			0
" the protesters are calling for @entity57 to step down ; there is a feeling that if @entity17 is to move towards a civilian government , it has to rid itself of the remnants of the old regime			1
" what is the international community 's view ? @entity17 has long been a vital link between the @entity201 world and the @entity202 , and international leaders -- many of them longtime allies of @entity5 -- hesitated to back calls for him to step down			1
however , most were quick to voice their support for the protesters ' rights to demonstrate freely and peacefully , and urged restraint on the part of authorities when dealing with the demonstrations			0
nine months on , @entity78 said such calls for calm needed to be reiterated			0
" the international community , particularly the @entity216 , needs to call for restraint , to urge the @entity55 to control the security forces in their dealings with protesters , to ensure their safety , " she said			0
what happens next ? parliamentary elections are due to take place next monday , november 28 , however it remains unclear if they will be postponed , given the unrest in recent days			0
" unless we see an increase in violence in the coming days , i think the elections will go ahead , " said @entity78			0
" but if there is an increase in violence , if the situation deteriorates into riots , it will be very difficult for them to take place			0
" so many protesters have already died , there is a fear that if the trouble spreads then the situation will not be conducive to holding elections , and we may see a postponement			0
" on tuesday , @entity57 insisted the vote would go ahead as planned , pledging his " commitment that the parliamentary elections will be held on time			0
" however , presidential elections are still months away -- @entity57 says they will be held by june 2012 -- and protesters are concerned that the military will remain de facto rulers until a new president is named			2
until then , @entity78 says , @entity17 's is " an unfinished revolution			2
