@entity1 , @entity0 -- police cordoned off one of the busiest thoroughfares in the heart of the @entity0 capital thursday as a bomb disposal team investigated a suspicious package found at the entrance to a bank			1
" this is the second bomb i 've been to today , " said one motorcycle police officer , who said he was not authorized to release his name to journalists , as he guarded a police line blocking off the five - lane @entity16 , less than a block away from the @entity0 parliament building			1
moments later , a bomb disposal expert dressed in the heavy green armor made famous in the movie " @entity23 " walked briskly away from the suspicious package			1
another member of the team counted down loudly in @entity0 , and then a controlled explosion echoed down the empty boulevard			2
authorities later said the package was not a bomb , but that was n't the case earlier thursday , when police destroyed another parcel at a courier office			1
@entity38 spokesman maj. @entity37 confirmed the parcel contained a " booby trap bomb			2
" the parcel was addressed to the @entity41 in @entity1 and the bombers put the archbishop of @entity1 as the sender of the package			2
@entity0 officials said it was the 14th explosive device to be discovered originating from @entity0 in the past four days			2
the events came as the two suspects in the largest letter - bomb campaign in @entity0 history were remanded into custody after appearing for testimony before a prosecutor , the @entity48 said			1
the two men are accused of participating in a wave of attempted bombings that has forced the @entity0 government to suspend air postal deliveries outside of the country for 48 hours			2
they were arrested in @entity1 on monday in possession of two parcel bombs , glock pistols , a bulletproof vest , and a wig			2
many of the packages were addressed to various embassies in @entity1 , but one arrived at @entity72 chancellor @entity71 's office in @entity73 and another , addressed to @entity75 prime minister @entity74 , made it to @entity75			0
@entity78 , 22 , and @entity79 , 24 were also in possession of a delivery slip for another parcel containing an explosive device which had been delivered to a courier service and was addressed to the @entity85 in @entity0 , police said			1
" these are stake - holders ... important members of a terrorist group , " @entity37 said			0
@entity0 authorities have stressed that they believe the wave letter bombs is the work of a home - grown @entity0 terror group that does not have ties to international organizations like @entity96			1
before this week 's attacks , one of the suspects , @entity78 , already faced an arrest warrant for his alleged membership in an illegal organization called the @entity103			0
both suspects have so far refused to cooperate with authorities , @entity0 officials said			1
" until this moment , they keep silent			0
they do n't talk to anyone , " @entity37 told @entity2			0
" it is their strategic tactic			0
" when they appeared thursday before a prosecutor @entity1 , they refused to testify , saying they " do not want to take part in this process			2
" they were then remanded into custody			0
for decades , leftist - and anarchist - inspired radical groups have carried out acts of political violence in @entity0			2
the most notorious and deadly of these groups , november 17 , claimed responsibility for the assassination of the @entity125 embassy defense attache @entity124 in @entity1 in 2000			0
@entity0 police , backed by @entity125 investigators , eventually succeeded in arresting the masterminds of november 17 in the years that followed			1
terrorism experts say they have seen an increase in @entity0 acts of terror since the 2008 shooting death of a @entity0 teenager by police in @entity1			1
that incident sparked angry riots and a wave of small bomb attacks on banks and @entity0 police			1
the group @entity103 is believed to have emerged during this period			0
" this new generation of terrorists have a different motive ... money , publicity , " said @entity145 of the @entity146 in @entity1			0
@entity145 compared these groups to the anarchists who terrorized @entity154 at the start of the 20th century			0
" they do n't have a specific leftist ideology , " he said			0
" they just state in their proclamations that their aim is to destroy the system			0
" in june 2010 , a @entity0 police officer was killed opening a letter bomb that was addressed to the country 's top law enforcement minister			1
authorities have so far avoided linking that deadly attack to this week 's parcel bombs , which apparently contain smaller amounts of explosives and have so far wounded one female employee of a private courier service			1
in fact , some @entity0 officials have sought to downplay the threat posed by this week 's letter bombers , by describing the suspects as young , poorly trained amateurs			1
" the police found them with bus tickets and cards to make telephone calls			0
a professional would n't do this , " said @entity183 , a spokesman for the office of the @entity0 prime minister			1
but the letter bombers have succeeded in forcing the @entity0 government to take the unprecedented step of halting international parcel delivery for 48 hours			1
they also have further rattled a society that is already struggling to deal with a deep financial crisis			0
@entity0 prime minister @entity195 denounced the bombers wednesday , accusing them of trying to destabilize his government 's efforts to rescue the @entity0 economy			0
" democracy will not be terrorized , " @entity195 announced on local television .			0
