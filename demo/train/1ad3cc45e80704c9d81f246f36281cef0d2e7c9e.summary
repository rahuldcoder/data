@entity0 -- a program that puts air traffic controllers in the cockpit to view life " on the other side of the frequency " is being resurrected almost a decade after it was killed by sept. 11 security measures			1
the program allows controllers to fly in the cockpit " jump seat " of commercial jets so they can become acquainted with the pilots ' workloads and responsibilities , and ultimately become better at their own			1
@entity17 administrator @entity16 , a former airline pilot , said the program benefits both controllers and pilots			1
" it 's a two - way dialogue			0
and it helps both parties understand some of the work environment that the other is operating in , " @entity16 said			0
previously known as " fam trips , " short for " familiarization trips , " the program and the name both were casualties of september 11			2
the terrorist attacks led to barricaded cockpit doors and to strict protocols on who could pass through them			0
and the term " @entity36 " is now used by the @entity37			0
in the decade that has elapsed , thousands of new employees have joined the ranks of controllers , meaning that fully one - third of the work force has never had the chance to ride in an airline cockpit			2
" i think it 's an outstanding idea , " said @entity45 , a controller at an @entity17 facility in @entity47			1
" we tell the airplanes what to do , and they make it work			0
and if controllers got back in the cockpit , we would understand what it takes to make that request work , " @entity45 said			1
officials say the program has minimal costs because the controllers sit on a " nonrevenue " fold - down seat behind the pilots			2
the program will be voluntary , and will be open to controllers who meet certain minimum work experience requirements			0
@entity67 chief @entity66 , who participated in the former program , said he found the experience valuable , and it helped him understand when pilots have the busiest workloads and how to better communicate with them			0
@entity16 said the @entity74 has approved the program , and that he expects it to begin in the coming weeks			0
the @entity74 said it has worked with the @entity17 on " a tightly controlled , restricted access program			2
" " air traffic controllers who ride in the cockpit as part of training are vetted and are thoroughly screened at the checkpoint , " the @entity74 said			1
" from a security standpoint , it makes sense to ensure that air traffic controllers have a clear understanding of what happens inside the cockpit			1

air traffic controllers to get *flight* in cockpit
idea is to better understand pilot workload and vice versa
@entity17 is restoring program killed by sept. 11
