@entity0 , @entity1 -- pregnant women infected with the @entity5 virus are more likely to be hospitalized from it and perhaps even more likely to die from it , according to a federal study released wednesday			1
a federal study released wednesday says the @entity5 virus seems to be affecting pregnant women more severely			1
the authors of the study suggest that pregnant women infected with the virus , commonly known as swine flu , take antiviral drugs to protect themselves and their fetuses			1
" if they feel sick , they need to call their health care provider and their health care provider needs to prescribe antivirals promptly , " said dr. @entity17 , lead author of the study and a medical officer at the @entity20			0
some doctors are reluctant to prescribe the drugs to pregnant women because they are concerned about their possible effect on the fetus , but @entity17 urged them to put aside those concerns			2
" we know , in this situation , the benefits very likely outweigh the risks , because pregnant women could get pretty darn sick with influenza , " the obstetrician - gynecologist told @entity2			2
in fact , they could get more than sick			0
of the 45 @entity5 deaths reported to the @entity20 between april 15 and june 16 , six ( 13 percent ) were among pregnant women			1
all of them had been healthy before infection , and all went on to develop viral pneumonia , leading to acute respiratory distress that required them to be placed on ventilators , @entity17 said			0
she acknowledged that the numbers are small , but said data collected since then are still reason for concern			0
of the 266 h1n1 deaths investigated by the @entity20 to date , 15 ( 6 percent ) were among pregnant women , she said			1
that 's six times the percentage of @entity51 women who are pregnant at any given time			0
in addition , pregnant women infected with @entity5 were four times as likely as sick people in the general population to be hospitalized for it , she said			1
but the study cautioned that part of that increase may be because of doctors being more likely to hospitalize a pregnant woman than a nonpregnant person with similar symptoms			0
still , the apparent disproportionate impact of @entity5 on pregnant women is not surprising , given the body changes that occur during pregnancy , she said			1
" as the uterus grows and pushes the diaphragm up , there is less room for the lungs , " affecting a woman 's ability to breathe , she said			0
pregnancy 's impact goes beyond structural ; it affects the body 's ability to fight off illness , she said			0
" a pregnant woman has to accommodate this foreign body of the growing fetus , so there is an immunological shift that occurs in pregnancy , " she said			2
though it is not clear whether that immunological shift translates into a greater likelihood of contracting the virus , there is no doubt that it can result in more severe illness among pregnant women who are infected with it , she said			2
" they are more severely affected , and that is consistent with what we are seeing with this @entity5 , " she said			0
still , @entity17 said she is not recommending that pregnant women avoid crowds or take any other precautions that would affect their daily routines			2
she said she hopes to continue to track what happens to the @entity5 - infected pregnant women in the report , though the details have yet to be worked out .			1

of 45 @entity5 deaths between april 15 - june 16 , 13 percent were pregnant women
