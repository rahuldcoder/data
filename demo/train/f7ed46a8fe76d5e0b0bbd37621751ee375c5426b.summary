-- eating well while traveling does n't always mean hitting up the newest , hottest and trendiest locales			2
besides , given the notoriously high failure rate in the restaurant industry , chances are the memorable new restaurant you try this year wo n't be around in the years to come			2
those who want a side of history with their dinners -- and a higher probability for a return visit -- should seek out some of @entity15 's wonderful , still - thriving historic restaurants , from the centuries - old steakhouses in @entity17 to @entity19 's 100 - year - old seafood counter , @entity21 's midcentury four - star , and the @entity23 breakfast spot that @entity26 , @entity25 , politicos , from @entity28 onward , have called home for decades			1
a second helping of historic @entity15 restaurants @entity32 , @entity33 @entity33 icon the @entity32 has been attracting the likes of presidents and beltway movers and shakers since its opening in 1856			1
it is the city 's oldest bar and restaurant , and though it has relocated twice -- most recently to 15th street two blocks from the @entity44 in 1983 -- many of the original spot 's artifacts , including taxidermy and gas lamps , made the move			1
like many of the country 's oldest restaurants , @entity32 serves a take on saloon fare -- meatloaf , chops , burgers -- but the chefs here also rotate in specials based on local ingredients and seasonality			1
the very famous @entity63 should not be missed			2
675 15th st. nw , @entity33 , 20005 10 best new bars in the @entity15 @entity65 , @entity66 @entity66 teems with venerable , historic restaurants and boasts a fair share of the country 's most distinguished steakhouses , yet @entity65 stands above the rest			1
@entity72 founded the restaurant in 1885 in what was then the @entity75 , @entity76			1
now , it 's a living relic , with a handful of clubby , wood - paneled rooms decked out in historic paraphernalia , framed old paintings , photographs and menus			1
the ceilings heave with 90,000 clay pipes once smoked by regulars , including @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
what to order ? that 's easy : the famed mutton chop , on the menu from the beginning and perfected year after year			1
72 west 36th street @entity66 , @entity66 10018 are you a travel over-sharer ? @entity97 , @entity21 @entity97 is a baby on this list , clocking in at just 62 years old , but it 's a treat for any traveler who appreciates lineage , architecture and high - caliber food			1
first , the building is a midcentury masterpiece --- all windows and stone and soaring ceilings -- designed by the father of @entity112 architecture @entity110 and @entity114 - based @entity113			1
inside , diners find an elegant four - star restaurant , run by third - generation owners @entity118 and @entity97			0
they revamped the menu offerings in 2008 when they brought chef @entity120 on board , snatching him up from the @entity123 - starred @entity122 in @entity66			1
now the restaurant is at the forefront of the @entity21 dining scene , relevant and revered			1
@entity127 , @entity128 98109 @entity129 , @entity130 in 1921 , when @entity130 was transfixed by train travel and urban trollies , @entity131 and @entity132 built and opened a trolly car specifically designed as a restaurant			0
it was a quick hit , and they were able to pick up and move easily when their rent grew too expensive			0
now , @entity140 has been parked solidly in the same spot for almost 90 years ( and expanded into a new location in @entity143 )			0
since they age prime beef on the premises , the restaurant is known for its excellent steaks			0
because it 's one of the few fine dining options open 24 - hours a day , it enjoys a solid patronage from late - night eaters			1
@entity153 6th street @entity130 , @entity154 90017 @entity155 , @entity19 come lunchtime @entity19 food lovers looking for pristine seafood , a clubby atmosphere , white tablecloths and power players head to 163 - year - old classic @entity161			0
those looking for the same pristine seafood but less pomp and more fun head to @entity155 , one of the real restaurant gems of the @entity169			0
the space consists of just one long raw bar , with around 20 stools , manned by a handful of friendly shuckers and servers doling out oysters , clams , lobster , chowders , seafood salads and wine			0
it 's all about the charm , not about the pretense			1
getting there outside of prime time lunch hours will guarantee a shorter wait to get in , as the secret has been out on this place since it opened in 1912			0
1517 polk street @entity19 , @entity154 94109 @entity191 , @entity192 @entity192 , of course , is rife with historic tourist attractions , including restaurants			1
and though @entity198 pub @entity191 is the second oldest restaurant in the city , having opened in 1868 , it is more of a local hangout and @entity75 go - to than a tourist hub			0
they serve solid pub grub -- burgers , mozzarella sticks , fish ' n ' chips -- as well as authentic @entity209 fare like @entity210 and sauerbraten and have one of the biggest beer selections in the city ( with taps that are changed regularly , given the crowds )			0
there are sing - a - longs every friday night to complete the beer hall vibe			0
31 @entity192 , @entity219 @entity221 's @entity220 , @entity26 widely known for serving the best breakfast in @entity26 , 62 year - old @entity23 spot @entity221 's is family run and has been a local favorite for generations			1
the migas are legendary , but do n't miss their huevos rancheros and complimentary hot fluffy biscuits			0
it is an established hangout for @entity26 politicos and looks about the same as it did when @entity28 held court here many mornings during his days in the @entity233			1
1511 e 6th @entity234 , @entity26 , @entity25 78702 - 3375 @entity235 , @entity236 of @entity236 ' historic grande dame restaurants , and there are a few , @entity235 , built in 1880 in a stunning @entity240 house , is the one that is n't just banking on its storied reputation			1
the kitchen has produced @entity236 legends , from @entity246 to @entity247 , and today showcases the food from future culinary rock star @entity249			0
the space suffered severe damage during @entity252 but was successfully refurbished and reopened in october 2006			0
the guidebooks will report that brunch is popular , and it is , but that 's not the time to go			1
@entity255 over there for an elegant dinner of haute @entity259 dishes like @entity261 crawfish gnocchi , pecan - crusted @entity263 fish and tenderloin of fire - spiced pork			0
1403 @entity266 , @entity130 70130 @entity267 or @entity268 , @entity269 @entity267 is not really a restaurant			0
it 's a take - out fish shack and smokehouse on the edge of the @entity274 in @entity269 , offering all manner of gorgeous smoked and fried fish to seafood - loving locals who wait patiently for their lunches and then chow down in their cars			2
it 's a classic institution , attracting crowds since 1948 , and a must for visiting seafood fanatics			2
@entity283 95th street , @entity269 , @entity284 60617 those seeking a historic @entity269 dining experience with actual chairs and tables better head toward the @entity268 , the 114 year - old @entity198 icon and one of the oldest family - run businesses in the country			0
what started as a men 's - only beer hall to showcase the @entity268 family 's signature beer has evolved over the century into a modern @entity198 restaurant with pierogis , @entity303 schnitzel , beer - battered cod and some un-german selections like mushroom paninis and @entity308 chicken salads			2
17 @entity269 , @entity284 60603 @entity309 's , @entity310 @entity309 's , the oldest @entity312 restaurant in the country continuously owned by the same family and a one - time favorite of @entity316 , serves the classic rib - sticking red sauce @entity312 - @entity15 fare that is now so ubiquitous it 's almost passe in the food world -- lasagna , spaghetti and meatballs , eggplant parmesan			2
but as one of the true @entity312 - @entity15 originals , @entity309 's serves this food well and serves it with pride in a boisterous row house			2
the three floors of the restaurant quickly fill on most nights with regulars , locals and visitors wanting to get an authentic introduction to the @entity312 culture of @entity337 , so reservations are recommended			0
