-- they call politics a blood sport , a battle royale , a bare - knuckle brawl			2
but why use bare knuckles when you can smack your presidential rival with a microphone , light saber or red , white and blue @entity12 ? a new video game for @entity15 , @entity16 and other @entity18 devices lets players do just that , with the help of president @entity22 or rival @entity23			1
" vote ! ! ! " comes from @entity25 ' @entity24 , best known for revolutionizing the mobile gaming space with its console - style " @entity28 " franchise			1
" @entity28 " games have generated nearly $ 50 million in revenue since launching in december 2010			0
" vote ! ! ! " allows political junkies ( and gamers alike ) to pick a stylized cartoonish version of their preferred presidential candidate and then duke it out through multiple rounds			2
the game focuses on arcade - style fighting and encourages players to keep on swinging for more votes			1
the game includes three 75 - second rounds			1
the fight starts at a national debate and then moves to the @entity45 lawn and concludes in the @entity46			0
before each round , players can customize their @entity50 or @entity51 candidate with an outfit , a weapon and an accessory			2
in keeping with the humorous tone , everything about this game is over the top			2
" we have some great outfits like an @entity64 costume , @entity66 - like boxing shorts , a super hero get - up and even ' 70s disco duds , " said @entity59 , creative director and co-founder of @entity24			2
" weapons are also on the fun side with things like an ice cream cone , a rocket pop , a @entity75 sparkler and a @entity76 , which is the handle of the @entity77 with a light saber coming out			0
" my favorite is the microphone , because when you hit your opponent with it , there 's a feedback sound			2
accessories include things like sunglasses , an eye patch , a baseball hat , a clown nose , an old powdered wig and a big , handlebar mustache			0
" as political pundits know all too well , the road to the @entity45 is a long and arduous fight			0
this arcade game replicates that campaign by going " old school " and focusing on earning high scores with these bouts			2
players are fighting for points , which , in turn , unlock votes			0
the votes come in tiers , so players earn one vote for a score of more than 10,000 points in a round , two votes for a score of more than 75,000 points in a round , and three votes by topping 250,000 points in a round			1
chair has married the gameplay with the vote counting and turned it into a globally connected experience			0
using the same technology that allows thousands of players to connect in " @entity129 's " clashmobs multiplayer experience , " vote ! ! ! " keeps a running tally worldwide of who 's collecting the most votes			1
" the game becomes more than just a single - player fight between @entity22 and @entity23 , " @entity59 said			1
" there 's this cool metagame where millions of people around the country will be playing the game and earning votes			1
if you 're actually voting for @entity22 , then you 'll likely be playing as him in the game			1
so we 'll have this running tally of who 's winning the election , at least in terms of battling it out in this cool new game			1
" using the same game mechanics of the " @entity28 " games , players will be able to rack up some seriously high scores through those additional weapons , accessories and costumes			1
during each round , players will have the ability to pull off a special move such as a back flip or kick flip to hit their opponent and literally knock a bunch of gold coins out of him			0
" there 's a lot of depth here as you 're shifting between trying to rack up as many points as you can while not getting hit , but then collecting gold as fast as you can so that you can then get to the end of the round and can get a bunch of free hits on your rival and knock all the money out of him , " @entity59 said			0
in keeping with the election theme , chair has partnered with @entity178 to encourage gamers to vote in the 2012 election			0
" it 's our way of having a fun @entity184 built into the game that is relevant and fits in with the subject matter , " @entity59 said			1
" we want to encourage our younger voters to pay attention			0
" bringing authenticity to the presidential candidates , @entity24 enlisted voice - alike actors to add humorous quips to the fighting game experience			1
gamers who choose @entity22 might hear him say , " oh , yeah			2
that 's what @entity22 is cooking ! " upon winning a fight , @entity22 will do a little dance and say , " i 'm gon na @entity22 your socks off ! " @entity23 has lines such as " it 's time to believe in @entity203 ! " and " i 've got a good feeling about this one ! " " we 're keeping it all nonpartisan and safe but very funny , " @entity59 said			1
" it 's not too heated			0
we 're not getting into health care or issues like that			0
these lines spice up the gameplay and keeps things fun			0
" making an election fun is no easy task			0
and it 's also nice to have something for free , especially during a time when @entity50 and @entity51 are asking everyone for donations			0
" vote ! ! ! " is n't your typical free app. it runs on the same game engine that 's responsible for some of the biggest game franchises of all time			1
and it brings to life a rich cartoon - style world of politics and deep fighting mechanics , offering a gameplay experience that can be played by veteran voters , and first - timers , alike			0
" vote ! ! ! " is a free app and is due to be released thursday .			1
