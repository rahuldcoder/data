-- perhaps your history teachers failed to alert you to these @entity4 facts : @entity5 nearly got mugged by an angry female mob ; @entity7 loved the @entity9 anthem " @entity10 , " and @entity11 was a @entity4 casualty			1
" @entity10 " was was a huge hit across the country and quickly became one of @entity7 's favorite tunes			1
the @entity4 , in addition to being among the defining moments of @entity20 history , is also the source of some bizarre and surprisingly cool trivia			2
@entity23 's first solution to slavery was a fiasco early in his presidency , @entity26 was convinced that white @entity20 would never accept black @entity20			1
" you and we are different races , " the president told a committee of " colored " leaders in august 1862			1
" ... but for your race among us there could not be war ... it is better for us both , therefore , to be separated			2
" @entity7 proposed voluntary emigration to @entity40 , seeing it as a more convenient destination than @entity42			1
this idea did n't sit well with leaders like @entity45 , who considered colonization to be " a safety valve ... for white racism			2
" luckily for @entity45 ( and the country ) , colonization failed spectacularly			2
one of the first attempts was on @entity51 , @entity52 , a small isle off the coast of @entity55			2
the island was owned by land developer @entity57 , who claimed he had approved a black @entity20 colony with the @entity55 government			2
no one bothered to call him on that claim			2
following a smallpox outbreak on the boat ride down , hundreds of black colonizers were abandoned on the island with no housing prepared for them , as @entity57 had promised			1
to make matters worse , the soil on @entity52 was too poor for any serious agriculture			2
in january 1864 , the @entity71 rescued the survivors from the ripoff colony			2
once @entity51 fell through , @entity7 never spoke of colonization @entity75 to @entity76 2			1
hungry ladies effectively mugged @entity5 the @entity9 's image hinged on the notion that the rebellious states made up a unified , stable nation			1
however , the hard times of war exposed just how much disunity there was in @entity86			2
civilians in both the @entity88 had to cope with scarcity and increased food prices , but the food situation was especially bad in the @entity92 because outcomes on the battlefield were directly linked to the @entity9 's currency -- rising food prices were hard enough to deal with without wild fluctuations in what the money in your pocket could buy			1
invading northern troops , of course , poured salt on the wounds of scarcity , burning crops and killing livestock			2
but in @entity110 , @entity111 , those who could n't afford the increasingly pricey food blamed the @entity9 government			1
hungry protesters , most of whom were women , led a march " to see the governor " in april 1863 that quickly turned violent			1
they overturned carts , smashed windows , and drew out governor @entity121 and president @entity5			1
@entity5 threw money at the protesters , trying to get them to clear out , but the violence continued			1
so , he threatened to order the militia to open fire , which settled things down pretty quickly			0
@entity127 used hot air balloons and submarines the balloons , directed by aeronaut @entity131 , were used to spot enemy soldiers and coordinate federal troop movements			0
during his first battlefield flight , at @entity135 , @entity131 landed behind @entity9 lines , but he was rescued			1
the @entity138 got no respect from military officials , and @entity131 resigned when he was assigned to serve , at a lower pay grade , under the director of the @entity143			1
in all , the balloonists were active for a little under two years			0
@entity146 in contrast , the paddle - powered @entity148 submarine saw exactly zero days of combat ( which is why it ca n't officially be called the @entity148 )			0
it suffered from some early testing setbacks , but after some speed - boosting tweaks , it was dispatched for @entity155 , @entity156 , with an eye towards aiding in the sack of @entity159			0
it was to be towed south by the @entity161 , but it had to be cut loose off of @entity162 on april 2 , 1863 , when bad weather struck			0
divers and historians are still looking for the @entity148 today			0
but the undersea capers do n't end there			0
a few months after the loss of the @entity169 , the @entity9 launched their own submarine , the @entity171 , named after its inventor			1
the @entity173 attacked and sank the @entity174 off the coast of @entity159 , making it the first submarine ever to sink an enemy ship			0
the only problem is that it also sank soon afterwards , and all eight crewmen drowned			0
" @entity10 " was only a northern song the precise details of when composer @entity183 wrote " @entity10 " seemed to change every time he told the story ( and some even dispute that @entity183 was the author in the first place )			0
but he first performed it in @entity188 in 1859 , with the title " @entity10			0
" @entity183 was a member of a blackface troupe known as the @entity191 , but he was indignant when he found out that his song had become an unofficial anthem of the @entity9			1
he went on to write a musicians ' marching manual for the @entity197 army			0
before and during the war , the song was a huge hit in @entity188 and across the country , and quickly became one of @entity7 's favorite tunes			1
the day after the surrender at @entity205 , @entity7 told a crowd of @entity197 revelers , " i have always thought ' @entity10 ' was one of the best tunes i have ever heard			1
our adversaries over the way attempted to appropriate it , but i insisted yesterday that we fairly captured it			0
" he then asked a nearby band to play it in celebration			0
@entity11 was at @entity216 @entity217 , that is the famous @entity11 's grandson			1
unfortunately for fans of the first @entity11 and his partly mythical ride , @entity219 was in the infantry , not the cavalry , with the 20th @entity225			1
he and his brother @entity227 were captured at the @entity228 in october 1861			0
after being released in a prisoner exchange , the @entity229 rejoined the fight			0
@entity11 was promoted to lieutenant colonel in september , 1862 , shortly before he was wounded in the brutal @entity233 ( a.k.a. the @entity233 )			1
@entity227 , however , was n't so lucky -- he was one of more than 2,000 @entity127 soldiers who did n't make it out of @entity236 , @entity237 , alive			0
by the following year , @entity11 was promoted again to @entity232 , leading the 20th @entity225 at @entity238 and , in his final days , at @entity216			1
on july 3 , 1863 , he was mortally wounded by a shell fragment that pierced his lung , and he died the next day			0
he was posthumously promoted again to brigadier general , and is buried in @entity242 , @entity243 to remember about @entity244 6			0
@entity245 fired one shot and then left at least , that 's what he claimed in " @entity249 , " a semi-fictional short story published in 1885 , after @entity251 , but before @entity252			1
in it , he recounts a whopping two weeks spent in 1861 with a @entity9 militia in @entity255 , @entity256			1
but he introduces the tale by saying that even the people who enlisted at the start of the war , and then left permanently , " ought at least be allowed to state why they did n't do anything and also to explain the process by which they did n't do anything			0
surely this kind of light must have some sort of value			0
" @entity245 writes that there were fifteen men in the rebel militia , the " @entity272 , " and he was the second lieutenant , even though they had no first lieutenant			1
after @entity245 's character shoots and kills a northern horseback rider , he is overwhelmed by the sensation of being a murderer , " that i had killed a man , a man who had never done me any harm			2
that was the coldest sensation that ever went through my marrow			0
" however , his grief is slightly eased by the realization that six men had fired their guns , and only one had been able to hit the moving target			2
the armies were n't all - male hundreds of women on both sides pulled a @entity292 , assuming male identities and appearances so that they might fight for their respective nations			1
some of them did it for adventure , but many did it for monetary reasons : the pay for a male soldier was about $ 13 month , which was close to double what a woman could make in any profession at the time			0
also , being a man gave someone a lot more freedoms than just being able to wear pants			0
remember , this was still more than half a century away from women 's suffrage and being a man meant that you could manage your monthly $ 13 wages independently			1
so it should come as no surprise that many of these women kept up their aliases long after the war had ended , some even to the grave			2
their presence in soldiers ' ranks was n't the best - kept secret			0
some servicewomen kept up correspondence with the home front after they changed their identities , and for decades after the war newspapers ran article after article chronicling the stories of woman soldiers , and speculating on why they might break from the accepted gender norms			0
perhaps not surprisingly , in 1909 the @entity339 denied that " any woman was ever enlisted in the military service of the @entity20 as a member of any organization of the @entity344 or @entity345 at any time during the period of the civil war			0
