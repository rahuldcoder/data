-- the deadly attack in @entity2 on @entity4 worshippers celebrating the feast of @entity6 adds one more layer to the country 's overlapping security crises			1
and they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in @entity12 and @entity13 , where animosity between @entity15 and @entity16 runs deep			1
@entity17 has its own cultural rifts -- between ethnic @entity19 and @entity20 , for example -- but it 's rare to see such an explosion of religiously motivated violence			1
@entity25 , with the @entity26 in @entity2 , described the attack as " a real shock			0
" " whatever else has happened in the past 30 years we have n't had this sort of sectarian attack aimed at killing lots of people , " she told @entity0 by phone from the @entity17 capital			1
the first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the @entity17 capital has come from a militant @entity15 group in @entity13 with a history of sectarian attacks against @entity16			1
a man identifying himself as a spokesman for @entity45 , a group with links to @entity47 and the @entity13 @entity48 , claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to @entity52 , a @entity54 - language station in @entity13 sponsored by the @entity56 government			1
a similar call was reportedly made to the @entity59 's urdu - language service			0
the group is an offshoot of the powerful @entity45 ( @entity62 ) , which has a record of high - profile suicide bombings in @entity13 , including the attack on the @entity66 in @entity67 in 2008			1
@entity69 's most destructive attack to date was a double suicide bombing in northwest @entity13 last year			1
the bombers -- wearing burkas -- killed 42 people belonging to tribes that opposed the @entity13 @entity48 , also known for its antipathy toward @entity16			1
if the claim by @entity69 proves valid , it would not surprise some @entity16 , who were quick to point the finger at some form of @entity13 involvement in the attacks tuesday			1
@entity62 has a long history of targeting the @entity85 community in @entity13			2
the @entity86 are numerous in both @entity13 and @entity17 , and make up much of @entity17 's @entity16 minority			1
they have endured decades of persecution in both countries , and @entity15 militants have frequently painted then as collaborators with occupying powers			0
this year , apparently in retaliation for the killing of @entity96 , @entity62 gunned down several @entity86 in @entity97 , capital of @entity99 province and also home to the @entity17 @entity48 's political leadership			2
in a subsequent open letter , the @entity62 warned : " we will rid @entity13 of [ this ] unclean people			2
@entity13 means land of the pure , and the @entity4 have no right to be here			1
" in october , @entity15 militants killed dozens more @entity86			0
in one instance , they stopped a bus of @entity16 pilgrims on their way to @entity110 from @entity99 and shot dead 26 male passengers in front of their families			0
@entity62 has not been obviously active in @entity17 since it maintained training camps there during @entity48 rule in the 1990s			2
but other @entity15 militants -- especially factions among the @entity13 @entity48 -- have established a presence in some @entity17 border provinces			1
and regional analysts perceive fluid links , contacts and cross-fertilization between the myriad groups operating in the @entity17 - @entity13 border region			1
the @entity48 were quick to disown and condemn the attacks			0
@entity25 says that while she is circumspect about the @entity48 's denial , such an attack would be at odds with the @entity48 leadership 's claim to be a national movement -- and is not part of a pattern of such attacks by the group			0
@entity137 also points out that @entity140 in his @entity139 message last month urged @entity48 fighters to " protect the lives , wealth and honor of ordinary people			0
" that being said , 80 percent of all civilian deaths in @entity17 are attributed to the armed opposition ; and orders from the @entity151 , as the leadership is known , are only patchily enforced by field commanders			2
the @entity48 are not a monolith , as one @entity17 observer puts it , and it is possible that at local level there may have been collaboration between a @entity48 operative and @entity62			2
the @entity48 have not played the sectarian card since becoming an insurgency			0
but when in power in the 1990s they brutally persecuted @entity17 's @entity86 community			2
@entity165 documented two massacres of @entity86 in 2000 and 2001 by @entity48 forces			0
and after capturing @entity170 e @entity168 in 1998 , @entity48 fighters killed hundreds of @entity86 in retaliation for the mass execution of its own soldiers the previous year			0
since the overthrow of the @entity48 , @entity17 's @entity86 have prospered -- in higher education , the government and the military and they have embraced new democratic processes			2
the annual @entity6 celebration in @entity2 has become more elaborate			0
that may have been temptation enough for the @entity86 ' enemies			0
if the bombings on tuesday were an attempt to sow sectarian strife in @entity17 , they most obviously imitate @entity47 in @entity12 , which when led by @entity187 tried to ignite a sectarian war between @entity15 and the country 's @entity4 majority in a series of attacks aimed at holy @entity4 occasions and shrines			1
read the latest on the attacks and the cancellation of @entity198 's trip @entity25 of the @entity199 believes that in @entity17 restraint will prevail			0
@entity86 leaders have already called on their community to remain calm and not to take the bait offered by these attacks			0
on all sides , @entity137 says , there is a realization that sectarian conflict is a no - win situation in which tit - for - tat attacks would claim hundreds of lives .			0

@entity4 worshippers were attacked as they celebrated @entity6
the attack *harkens* violent sectarian rivalries in @entity12 , @entity13
this kind of sectarian *aggression* is rare in @entity17
