-- the puppeteer who gave @entity5 's @entity4 his voice allegedly threw a crystal meth sex party for a teenage boy in 2004 , according to a federal lawsuit filed this week			1
@entity9 , now 24 , is the fourth man to sue @entity4 , but he was the first one to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen			1
@entity9 ' lawsuit is " meritless and barred by the statute of limitations , " @entity13 lawyer @entity12 told @entity0 tuesday			1
" mr. @entity4 continues to deny any wrongdoing , and we intend to defend this case forcefully			2
" although @entity9 called it an " an adult consensual relationship " last november , the revelation triggered @entity13 's suspension from @entity5 and eventually his resignation			1
clash , who provided the high - pitched voice of the iconic furry red @entity4 since 1984 , acknowledged a relationship between " two consenting adults " when @entity9 ' story first emerged , but he said it otherwise was a " false and defamatory allegation			1
" " i am a gay man , " @entity13 , 52 , said in a statement in november			0
" i have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter			0
" when heroes disappoint our kids three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits , filed last november and december , accusing @entity13 of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them			0
they are all represented by @entity44 lawyer @entity43 , who also filed @entity9 ' lawsuit monday			1
@entity4 's lawyer has asked a judge to dismiss the three other suits based on his argument that the men waited too long to sue			1
the federal statute of limitations on such civil cases is six years , while their allegations involve relationships that ended more than 10 years ago , @entity51 said in a court filing this month			2
each lawsuit contends that the men only realized in the last year or so that they suffered psychological and emotional damage from their encounters with @entity13			2
" @entity13 was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers , while at the same time he was , in secret , preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests , " the @entity9 suit alleged			1
while the allegations in the newest suit mirror what the other men contend , @entity9 ' complaint is the only one to allege drug use by @entity13			1
" @entity13 smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with @entity80 , " the lawsuit said			0
" @entity13 also gave @entity80 ' poppers ' as a sexual aide			0
while @entity13 had sexual contact with @entity80 , the chauffeur watched and masturbated			0
" " poppers " generally refers to alkyl nitrites in capsule form that produce a physical rush when broken and inhaled : crystal meth refers to crystal methamphetamine			0
@entity9 was 16 when he met @entity13 in @entity92 " at a social networking event for models and actors , " the suit said			1
" @entity4 told @entity80 he would help @entity80 with his acting career , " it said			2
@entity4 resigned from his job on " @entity5 " after the first lawsuit was filed in november			2
" i am resigning from @entity101 with a very heavy heart , " @entity4 said in a written statement at the time			0
" i have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization			0
personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work @entity5 is doing and i can not allow it to go on any longer			0
i am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately			0
" despite his stepping down , @entity13 's voice will be used for @entity4 through 2014 , as the next season of " @entity5 " has already been filmed			1
@entity0 's @entity111 contributed to this report .			0
