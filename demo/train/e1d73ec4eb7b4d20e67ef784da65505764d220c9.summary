-- he was once considered the obvious choice to become the next leader of world football , but that vision appears to be waning			1
@entity6 is so disillusioned and frustrated at the way @entity8 conducts itself that it would take an almighty change to persuade him to run for presidency of the ruling body , @entity0 has learned			1
while @entity14 has yet to approach anybody to stand against incumbent @entity16 , there is only a 10 % chance that @entity6 will be that man , a source close to the @entity18 told @entity0			1
@entity6 , the president of @entity21 football 's governing body , believes there would need to be unrecognizable change within @entity8 to eradicate all traces of corruption before he considered his candidacy , the source said			1
last weekend , @entity28 newspaper @entity27 published allegations claiming a @entity31 official paid more than $ 5 million in an attempt to secure support for the @entity36 state 's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament			0
according to allegations , @entity38 made secret payments to soccer officials in the run - up to the controversial 2010 ballot			0
@entity43 , the former president of the @entity44 , was a member of @entity8 's powerful 24 - person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010			2
@entity43 , who was banned for life from football the following year after separate bribery allegations , said he would not be making any comments on the new scandal other than he believed " that the truth will find its way to ( the ) public one way or another			0
" the @entity31 2022 bid committee strenuously denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of any payments made on its behalf			0
on tuesday , the @entity28 @entity64 reported @entity6 met with @entity43 just days before the @entity65 was awarded to @entity31			0
the source confirmed to @entity0 that while @entity6 did meet with @entity43 , the subject of the conversation was the @entity8 presidency and not the @entity71			1
according to the source , @entity43 wanted @entity6 to stand against @entity16 in 2011 but the former @entity18 international player refused			1
it was then , according to the source , that @entity43 decided to challenge @entity16 himself , but was unsuccessful after being found guilty by a @entity8 ethics committee of offering cash for votes and was banned for life			2
in a copy of a letter written to the @entity64 and provided to @entity0 , @entity6 describes the allegations as " astonishing			0
" " i have obviously met with mr. @entity38 on many occasions in 2010 as we were both members of the same @entity84 since 2002 , " read the letter			0
" during those conversations with mr. @entity43 , the topic of the discussions was my potential candidature for the @entity90			0
mr. @entity43 was indeed trying to convince me to become a candidate for the 2011 @entity8 presidential elections			2
" additionally , i wish to reiterate that i am the only member of the @entity84 who publicly stated for which bid i have voted -- proof of my full transparency -- and that no - one ever dictates terms or conditions to me			0
" unfortunately , i am no longer surprised by the circulation of unfounded rumors which aim at tarnishing my image , especially in such an important time for the future of football			0
" the source told @entity0 that the current allegations have not damaged @entity6 's reputation within @entity14 , although he is believed to have grown tired of the constant sniping , while @entity6 has been one of the only men to reveal he voted for @entity31 , the admission has left him open to attacks , while others who did likewise remain in the shadows			2
the episode has made @entity6 seriously consider whether he will ever run for @entity8 , the source told @entity0 , adding that the @entity18 believes he may be best suited to remaining in @entity115 and working on a number of other football projects			1
while @entity6 , 58 , does not intend to stand against @entity16 in the presidential contest , @entity14 would like to avoid a scenario where the 78 - year - old runs for a fifth consecutive term unopposed			1
@entity16 , 78 , is expected to declare his intention to stand once again when he addresses @entity8 's 209 members this weekend and go back on the promise he made not to stand again			1
the other man who could challenge @entity16 is @entity18 @entity126 -- a man who has already stated he is unlikely to win should @entity16 stand again			1
his campaign has inspired little confidence at @entity14			0
@entity14 is keen to ensure it picks a candidate , thought to be from its committee , which does not stand to lose their career if defeated			0
a number of @entity14 officials are expected to stage a sit - down protest against @entity16 at the @entity137 meeting in @entity138 , @entity139			2
it is hoped that the protest will give @entity8 an indication of the frustration and annoyance at the way the game 's governing body is running football .			1

@entity14 president @entity6 *unhappy* with way @entity8 runs world football
@entity18 unlikely to stand for @entity8 presidency at next year 's elections
@entity16 expected to stand for fifth term , breaking his 2011 promise
@entity14 , @entity14 's governing body , does not want @entity16 to stand unopposed
