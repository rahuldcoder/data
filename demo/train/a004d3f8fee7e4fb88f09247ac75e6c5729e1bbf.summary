-- @entity1 says he 's not listening to any of his critics in the buildup to the masters , as the world @entity5 reflects on his troubled start to 2013			1
the @entity8 missed the cut at january 's @entity10 after announcing a deal with sponsor @entity12 which could see him earn as much as $ 250 million			1
@entity1 followed that by walking off the course at the @entity15 a month ago before apologizing , having struggled to produce his best golf with a new set of clubs			1
that stuttering start to the season prompted the 23 - year - old to change his schedule -- pulling out of a charity event -- to unexpectedly play this week in the @entity24 , citing the need for more practice ahead of the year 's first major at @entity28			1
" no one knows what i 'm trying to do more than me , " he told @entity0 's @entity29 in an exclusive interview			2
" there was a lot of hype at the start of the year obviously with the switch to @entity12 , coming off the back of such a great year last year			1
it 's nice now everything 's settled down a bit			0
" i know what i 'm doing			0
and i know what i 'm working on the course			0
of course you see some things sometimes , but you try just to block it out and try , i guess , to have faith in what you 're doing			0
" @entity1 was intending to be in @entity51 this week as part of his role as a @entity55 ambassador , but the two - time major winner took the advice of his caddy @entity58 and traveled to @entity59 to play more competitive golf ahead of the masters			1
" i decided after my second round in @entity63 last week , " explained @entity1			1
blog : putting key to @entity67 's revival " my caddy mentioned it to me and i took a moment to think about it			2
and i thought it was the best thing to get ready for the masters			2
" @entity1 's play was patchy at @entity63 , and he laughed as he recalls hitting the ball in the water 10 times			2
but he was also the longest driver in the @entity79 tournament , and the seventh best putter			0
he finished tied for 45th , 12 shots adrift of winner @entity82			0
resurgent @entity83 @entity1 , who won the @entity84 and the @entity85 , readily admits such play will not be good enough to prosper this year -- especially given the form of a certain player who has just knocked him off the top of the world rankings			1
" @entity67 's played great golf this year , " said @entity1 of his new @entity12 stablemate and 14 - time major winner @entity67			1
you could see last year he was getting very close			0
he won three times last year as well			0
" he 's been putting very well , which is a big key , and if he putts like that for the rest of the season he 's going to be very difficult to beat			0
" after @entity101 , for which @entity1 made the deadline to enter by just half an hour , he heads to @entity28 -- where he will seek to win his first coveted green jacket			1
at the 2011 masters , @entity1 missed out on the first major win of his career as he threw away a four - shot lead in the fourth and final round			1
" it 's still the same , " he said			0
" it might not be quite the same as the first time i went down but you still get a special feeling , a special excitement when you drive down @entity116			0
it 's just a different atmosphere to anything in golf			0
" his excitement will be more than matched by golf fans should the @entity121 turn into a showdown between @entity1 and a resurgent @entity83 .			2

@entity1 is paying no attention to his critics heading into the masters
the world @entity5 has endured a troubled 2013 since switching to @entity12 clubs
he has been *replaced* at the top of the world rankings by @entity12 stablemate @entity67
the 2013 masters at @entity28 begins on april 11
