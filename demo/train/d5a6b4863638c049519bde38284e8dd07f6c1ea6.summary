@entity0 -- before @entity3 asked a doctor to treat his insomnia with propofol , he tried falling asleep to the physician reading him bedtime stories			1
the pop star 's desperate decades - long search for sleep ultimately led to his death when he overdosed on the surgical anesthetic on june 25 , 2009			2
the trial to decide if @entity3 's last concert promoter is liable for his death is nearing an end after more than four months of testimony			1
@entity19 's lawyers plan to rest their defense case this week , with @entity3 lawyers presenting several rebuttal witnesses			2
closing arguments are likely the last week of september			0
dr. @entity24 , whose video testimony was shown to jurors friday , refused @entity3 's request for propofol infusions in 2003 , but six years later -- in dr. @entity24 's words -- another physician " put him to sleep like a dog			1
" @entity3 's mother and three children contend @entity19 is liable for his death because the company hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity36 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for @entity3 's propofol overdose			1
@entity36 told investigators he gave @entity3 nightly infusions of the drug to treat his insomnia the last two months of his life			1
@entity19 lawyers argue @entity3 , not their executives , chose and controlled @entity36 and that the company had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments in the privacy of the singer 's bedroom			1
the producers ignored warning signs that @entity3 's health was deteriorating , and instead of finding another doctor to intervene , they kept @entity36 and made him responsible for getting @entity3 to rehearsals for his comeback concerts , the @entity52 contend			1
@entity3 and doctor were " best friends " dr. @entity24 's practice is near the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , where @entity3 lived until his acquittal in a child molestation trial in 2005			1
" we were best friends , you know , " dr. @entity24 testified			0
" i did n't have a better friend and i do n't think he did			0
" @entity3 " would just show up " at @entity24 's home every week or so without warning , he said			2
the doctor would open his door to leave for work in the morning " and he would just be standing there			0
" his driver told him once that @entity3 had been waiting at his door for 35 minutes , not wanting to knock because he thought that was impolite			2
@entity24 's children would stay home from school some days @entity3 visited			2
" i 'd come home from work and there 's @entity3 there at the house and they 're watching cartoons or , you know , eating pizza , " @entity24 said			2
at first it was a novelty , but after several years it was routine , he said			0
the doctor was asked under cross examination if @entity3 a good father			1
" no , he is an amazing father , " he answered			0
" because i 'm a good father and he was better than me			0
he respected them and as they respected him and he would correct them gently			0
" doctor : @entity3 did n't fake pain to get drugs @entity19 's defense includes the contention that @entity3 cultivated friendships with doctors to gain access to drugs to feed a secretive addiction			1
but @entity24 denied @entity3 ever used their friendship to get prescriptions to medication that were not clinically indicated			2
although he was compelled to testify as a witness for @entity19 , @entity24 's testimony boosted the @entity3 case by showing that @entity3 's use of painkillers was medically justified by chronic pain suffered in a 1997 stage accident , @entity3 lawyers said			1
the doctor said @entity3 showed the " classic symptoms of lower back pain " and an @entity129 study confirmed a bulge in a disc in his lower spine consistent with where his pain was			1
dr. @entity24 said he never suspected @entity3 was faking his pain to get painkiller shots			2
" i looked for that because there are plenty of people that come in and try to scam me , so i 'm always looking for that , " he testified			0
while the doctor said " nothing implied " that @entity3 was abusing painkillers , there was one incident during house call in 2002 that caused him to suspect @entity3 might be getting additional shots of the powerful opioid @entity146 from another doctor			1
he noticed " a little blood spot " on @entity3 's t - shirt after he gave him a shot , he said			2
" i lifted it up and there 's a little @entity154 over it and i said , ' @entity3 , ' i said , ' you have another doctor that gave you a shot			1
' i said , ' you realize what risk you put yourself and me at by doing that ? who came and gave you a shot ? ' ' oh , no , i did n't -- it was not a shot			2
" @entity19 contends @entity3 kept doctors in the dark about other doctors ' treatments			2
the argument is important to their contention that his dangerous drug use would have shortened his life even if he had not died in 2009			0
the shorter his life expectancy , the less money they might be ordered to pay in damages if found liable in his death			0
" i told him , i said , ' you know what , i ca n't do this , okay , ' cause if you 're doubling up , you know , i give you a shot and then you 've already had one , ' i said , ' i could kill you , ' " @entity24 testified			0
@entity24 remained close friends with @entity3 even though he stopped treating him soon after that incident , he said			2
bedtime stories versus @entity193 the doctor 's testimony revealed more about @entity3 's relationship with the drug that killed him -- the surgical anesthetic propofol , also known as @entity193			1
@entity19 lawyers contend it was a drug @entity3 knew a lot about , but that their executives had no knowledge of			0
@entity204 , @entity3 's former wife , testified earlier that @entity206 doctors infused the singer with it in a @entity210 hotel on two nights to help him sleep between " @entity213 " tour shows in 1997			1
@entity3 lawyers pointed out that @entity215 , who is now the @entity19 co-ceo , was @entity3 's tour manager then			0
five years later , @entity3 asked @entity24 to help him go to sleep			1
" sometimes , he 'd say , ' @entity24 , do me a favor , see if i can sleep , i 'm going to get under the covers on that rollout couch , ' and he said , ' just read me out of a book , ' " @entity24 testified			0
" i 'd find a book that looked interesting and i 'd just start reading or i 'd tell him stories			0
that did n't work because often times he got excited about the story and say , ' that really happened ? ' or something			0
anyway , i 'd read to him -- and when it seemed like he was asleep i 'd slip out , you know , kind of hard because the door made a little noise			0
if i thought he was asleep i 'd leave , and once in awhile he 'd say , ' good night , @entity24 , ' and when i got to the door , he was n't asleep at all			0
" dr. @entity24 also tried to help @entity3 sleep with sedatives , including @entity237 , without success , he said			1
@entity3 , however , revealed to him in 2003 that he had a stash of propofol in a closet of his @entity63 bedroom , @entity24 said			1
" he said , ' would you put me to sleep , i have n't been able to sleep for four days , ' and i said , ' with what ? ' and he goes , ' well , i have this stuff , ' and i said , ' @entity243 , i do n't do @entity248 sedation			1
you need an anesthesiologist to do that			0
' and he said , ' oh , it 's safe , man , i used it for all those years between shows and i got put to sleep			0
' i said , ' i ca n't imagine that was good sleep			0
" you know , he said , " no , it works really well			0
" he said @entity3 told him that during his world tours him a doctor " would put in the @entity248 and put me to sleep , and he 'd stay there for eight hours and wake me up ' cause i would go -- if i had three days between shows , i would have three days i did n't sleep and , you know , that i could n't put on the show i wanted to have , you know , i mean , i want my shows to be , you know , as high end as possible			1
" " sounds like a doctor who did his job , not like this other guy , who just started the drip and left the room and basically put him to sleep like a dog , " @entity24 said			1
@entity3 was " pretty complacent " when he rejected his request for help with propofol and he never asked for it again , @entity24 said			1
dr. @entity36 told @entity1 's @entity282 in april that @entity3 had " his own stash " of propofol in his home before he began treating him with it in 2009			1
" i did not agree with @entity3 , but @entity3 felt that it was not an issue because he had been exposed to it for years and he knew exactly how things worked , " @entity36 said			0
" and given the situation at the time , it was my approach to try to get him off of it , but @entity3 was not the kind of person you can just say ' put it down ' and he 's going to do that			1
" @entity3 lawyers argue that @entity19 was negligent for not checking out @entity36 's distressed financial situation before agreeing to pay him $ 150,000 a month			0
it created a conflict of interest that led @entity36 to ignore safe practices and his responsibility to @entity3 's health , they contend .			0
