@entity0 -- nearly half of all @entity4 are worried about the collapse of a bridge somewhere in the @entity4 , yet nearly two - thirds reject higher taxes to inspect and fix them , according to a new @entity9 poll released thursday			1
the collapse of a bridge in @entity11 has put @entity4 's infrastructure on the political agenda			1
in the poll , 52 percent were either " very worried " or " somewhat worried " about a bridge collapsing			1
forty - seven percent were either " not too worried " or " not worried at all			1
" one percent had no opinion			0
but only one in three @entity4 are concerned that a bridge that they drive across regularly will collapse , while 69 percent are not worried			1
in an effect called @entity18 -- " @entity19 " -- that is common in polling , @entity1 polling director @entity21 said people often feel that situations locally are better than the national averages			0
the new numbers come eight days after an interstate highway bridge in @entity27 , @entity11 , collapsed into the @entity28			0
at least five people were killed in the collapse			0
despite the concerns , only one - third of those polled favor increasing the tax on gas to pay for bridge inspections and repairs			1
the federal program to inspect and repair bridges is funded mostly by the federal tax on gasoline			1
sixty - five percent of those questioned were against raising that tax			2
" polls sometimes show that the public is willing to accept higher taxes to pay for popular projects , but not in this case , " @entity21 said			2
" with the price of gasoline hovering around $ 3 , it may not be surprising that @entity4 do n't want to pay any more at the pump , even though they worry about bridge safety			1
" several members of the @entity53 are calling for the tax hike in the wake of the @entity57 bridge collapse in @entity27 last week			1
congressman @entity58 , @entity59 , on wednesday said he would introduce legislation for bridge repair funding and increased inspections			2
he says a 5 - cent increase in the gas tax would pay for the proposed three - year program by generating $ 8.5 billion a year			2
citing 74,000 bridges rated by the federal government as " structurally deficient , " @entity58 told reporters " we can not wait for another tragedy			0
we must , and we will , act decisively			0
" at a news conference thursday morning at the @entity73 , president @entity71 dismissed raising the federal gasoline tax , at least until @entity75 changes the way it spends highway money			0
" it 's an interesting question , about how @entity75 spends and prioritizes highway money , " the president said			0
" my suggestion would be that they revisit the process by which they spend gasoline money in the first place			0
" " if bridges are a priority , let 's make sure we set that priority first and foremost , before we raise taxes , " @entity71 said			2
the poll involved telephone interviews with 1,029 @entity4 adults conducted august 6 - 8 , 2007			1
