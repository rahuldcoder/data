editor 's note : @entity3 strategist @entity2 was a former campaign consultant for @entity5 's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns			1
@entity2 is a partner in @entity7 , a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising			2
he has produced many @entity3 political ads and has clients such as the @entity12 @entity11			0
@entity2 says @entity14 's change theme has buckled to " top - down liberalism			1
" ( @entity16 ) -- in theater , they say the second act is the hardest to write			0
it requires relentless focus and discipline			0
the writer must give himself fearlessly to one central idea and never waver , though temptation is the opposite : there are many paths a story can take			0
so it is in politics , as @entity14 's campaign is learning			1
the clear campaign of change ran into trouble in @entity36 when it was tasked with explaining what change actually meant			2
@entity14 , as they say in show business , " ran out of script			2
" the wind in his sails stalled in the hot calm of august and he has yet to recover			0
after @entity48 's improbable resuscitation to seize the @entity3 nomination , the @entity46 senator 's top aides briefed him about his exacting challenge : he would go into the conventions trailing @entity14 by at least 8 percentage points and then battle back through the fall to parity			1
yet , as cooler days and hotter rhetoric mark the start of the fall finale , it is @entity14 who finds himself clawing back , forced to attack , launching uncharacteristic partisan and personal attacks against a @entity48 who has " lost track " of and is " confused " about how many houses he owns			2
how did the soaring campaign of change become grinding politics - as - usual and crash so thunderously to earth ? the @entity14 campaign 's clear message in the primaries was a bottom - up , organic populism that cast voters themselves as the agents of change			1
" we are the change we have been waiting for , " @entity14 told his supporters during the primaries			1
in return , they sang , " yes we can			0
" this heady mix of populism and change swelled his campaign into a cause			1
in marketing terms , it is called " voter as hero			0
" @entity14 empowered his supporters , telling them they , not the old political establishment , could achieve anything			2
bottom - up politics is one thing , however			1
bottom - up government , another			1
when @entity14 became the nominee of the national @entity100 establishment , the candidate of hope ran into political reality : his party 's canons of governing are the opposite of change			1
@entity14 may believe " change does n't come from the top down , it comes from the bottom up , " but the leadership of his party does n't			1
the national @entity100 establishment , from the @entity114 and @entity115 to @entity116 and @entity117 in @entity118 , still believe in top - down big - government from @entity120 , especially if they get to run the factory			1
politically , they are industrial - age dinosaurs they believe the era of big government is back , not over			1
they would keep money and power in their hands , not devolve it to the average @entity12			0
that was not something the @entity132 @entity100 were eager to confess			2
instead , they advocated a sly @entity135 - style socialism that would not speak its intent			0
" @entity138 , quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege , " the @entity100 offered during the first night of their convention			2
a big - government health - care factory run by @entity120 ? that 's change ? why not the same for food , clothing and shelter ? but relax , @entity148 , an even bigger public - sector industrial plant will impose no cost on your family			1
@entity14 's party promises not to tax you , just business -- the people who sell you your groceries and gasoline and sign your paychecks			1
as @entity159 noted in his @entity3 convention speech , " they wo n't take any water out of your side of the bucket			0
" this is not " voter as hero " but , instead , " voter as victim			0
" a heroic @entity120 has all the money , the power , and the answers			2
same old , same old			0
so the candidate of change fell silent			0
and he sang change never again			0
@entity14 could have spoken truth to power			2
he could have pledged to confront the @entity100 establishment			1
he could have brought a more natural , organic era of bottom - up government , not just bottom - up politics , to a dated party clinging to a decaying philosophy of authority			1
but when the irresistible force of @entity14 's bottom - up politics met the immovable object of @entity100 power , it was the dream , not the power , that conceded			1
" yes we can " turned out to mean not " yes the people can " , just " yes @entity120 can			2
it would have refreshed the @entity100 and the country			0
this movie is not new : the candidate who runs to change the establishment does n't			0
instead , we see it change him			0
the hope for real change in @entity120 has been suffocated by an older generation 's embrace			1
now , @entity14 finds himself trapped without a post-partisan message			2
instead of challenging politics - as - usual , he sells the usual partisan politics : " @entity211 " , he shouts from rooftops , sounding like every other @entity208 in the chorus , pretending partisanship is fresh			0
the story ? bottom - up change ran into top - down liberalism			1
old - fashioned liberalism won			0
that 's @entity217 by for the play 's end			0
this opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : @entity14 's message was populism and bottom - up change
@entity14 campaign taken over by @entity100 establishment , he says
@entity2 : @entity100 champions big government and opposes change
" yes we can " turned into " yes @entity120 can , " @entity2 says
