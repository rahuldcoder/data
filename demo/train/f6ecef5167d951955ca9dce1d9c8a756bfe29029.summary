-- here 's what the @entity1 weekend taught us : @entity4 really likes the " @entity6 " franchise , but @entity4 loves movies			1
the four - day holiday racked up $ 314 million in receipts , the largest - ever @entity1 weekend at the box office			1
as for " @entity12 , " it 's hard to talk about the successful opening without resorting to cliché			2
despite hitting theaters in a crowded may marketplace , the @entity16 film earned an estimated $ 120,019,000 , the fourth - highest @entity1 opening in history , for a per - theater average of $ 33,400			1
that 's the second - biggest opening this year , behind @entity23 3 , and a sizable leap from the trajectory of the previous two @entity26 ( and most predictions )			0
the franchise 's appeal seems to be growing in reverse ( we wrote a cover story on it ! ) , getting bigger with each film			0
the newest installment earned an " a " @entity35 ( " @entity36 " from audiences under 25 ) with an almost even split between men and women ( 51/49 percent )			0
conventionally , that would indicate that " @entity12 " will hold up better than the typical tent pole — however , @entity42 also earned an " a " and good reviews while still dropping more than 60 percent in its second weekend			1
that said , it still would n't affect the success of the latest film so far : @entity12 has grossed $ 317 million globally against a $ 160 million budget			2
and in case you have n't heard : " @entity51 " is coming soon			0
speaking of big - budget , male - skewing films : " @entity55 " earned an estimated $ 51,215,000 over the four - day weekend , for a per - theater average of $ 14,406 , and $ 63 million since thursday			1
that 's hardly nothing — especially for a hard - r comedy , which has a notoriously rocky record at the box office			1
but the $ 100 million film 's " @entity61 and middling reviews indicate that word - of - mouth wo n't help subsequent weekend grosses			2
from here , it 's hard to see @entity55 matching the $ 250 + million grosses of the first two films , though strong foreign sales should help @entity71 overcome the sting			2
the weekend 's third wide release , " @entity74 , " topped expectations with an estimated $ 42,600,000 for the four - day and a per - theater average of $ 10,974			1
tracking suggested an opening in the mid- 30s , but the @entity80 film had a plum release spot at the start of the tent pole season without any major family - friendly competition			0
good reviews and an " a " @entity35 suggest real legs , which means " @entity74 " could finish with more than $ 150 million domestically on a $ 93 million budget			2
last week 's " @entity91 " earned an estimated $ 44 million for the long weekend , which softens its second week drop to 33 percent and an overall domestic gross of $ 155.8 million			1
the well - reviewed but maligned sequel may not top the previous film 's gross of $ 257.7 million , but it should easily top $ 200 million			2
" @entity97 " earned an estimated $ 24,351,000 , lifting its total domestic gross to $ 372.4 million			1
with a new director and a surge of post- " @entity101 " buzz , the third " @entity23 " has already beaten the previous two installments and is on track for a domestic finish above $ 400 million			0
in limited release , @entity106 's critically - acclaimed romantic drama " @entity110 " opened with a per - theater average of $ 64,400 at five theaters			0
@entity12 — $ 120 million 2			1
the @entity55 — $ 51.2 million 3			1
@entity91 — $ 47 million 4			0
@entity74 — $ 42.6 million 5			0
@entity23 3 — $ 24.4 million check back next week when @entity112 's post-apocalyptic " after @entity115 " opens against the @entity114 thriller " @entity111			0
