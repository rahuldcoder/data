-- @entity1 , then 11 , thought she was heading to the trophy store with her gymnastics coach			1
instead they ended up in his apartment -- and , she said , she ended up naked as he " forced himself inside of me			0
" she screamed out -- in pain , and for him to stop			0
" he would n't , " she recalled			2
" and i 'll never forget the words he whispered in my ear at that time : ' this is what you want			0
this is what all the girls want			0
' " @entity1 is not alone , as several of @entity23 's ex-elite young gymnasts -- speaking to @entity0 decades later , now as a group of adults -- detailed similar , graphic allegations of sexual and physical abuse			1
besides an initial " no comment " in a phone conversation weeks ago , @entity23 did not return repeated phone calls or e-mails from @entity0 , nor did he respond to a knock at his door			1
but in an interview earlier this year with @entity0 @entity36 affiliate @entity35 , he defiantly insisted that those accusing him are all lying			1
" i was not abusive to them , " said @entity23 , now in his 60s			1
" i did n't do anything wrong			2
" he was acquitted by a jury in 1982 on child abuse and battery charges , after two young athletes in his @entity46 , @entity47 , gym accused him of wrongdoing			0
the parents of two of the ex-gymnasts who are now alleging abuse by @entity23 helped finance his defense during that trial			1
one was the family of @entity56 , a star gymnast who was on @entity58 ' @entity57 in 1983 - 1984 , according to that organization 's website			0
she said that @entity23 " was somebody that my parents trusted			1
" another , @entity65 , recalled how her father referred to @entity23 as an " adoptive son " in messages sent out to family and friends before @entity71			1
her parents did not know , she said , that @entity23 was physically abusing her -- and how that turned to sexual abuse when she was 8 or 9 years old			1
" i would ride with him in a car to a meet , " @entity65 recalled			0
" he 'd be tickling me at a stoplight or something of that nature , and his hands would reach down and go into my privates			0
" some days at the gym , @entity56 said , could be " fantastic , and other days it was kind of a living hell			0
" the intent was to produce world - class athletes -- like @entity88 , who won the 1985 @entity91 @entity90 and 1987 @entity92 all - around titles -- by pushing them to their limits , with the ex-gymnasts claiming @entity23 sometimes used physical force to make a point and exert his authority			1
@entity65 , for instance , pointed to a cigarette burn on her finger that she said came from @entity23			1
and @entity104 described how " he used to grab you by your neck and he would pin you up against the wall			0
and basically just choke you			0
" several remembered @entity23 standing over them , as they were on all fours -- sometimes kicking them in the stomach , at other times poking them with a toothpick he was known to chew on in his mouth			1
" girls would be sobbing , crying , " recalled @entity1			0
@entity23 was n't @entity119 ' coach , though she was a regular at the gym because her sister was one of his students			1
she remembered being 13 and heading with him to his apartment -- she thought to pick up some equipment , until she felt his hand " around the back of my neck , really hard " and she sensed " something good was n't going to happen			2
" " and i was right , " @entity129 said			0
in a different incident , @entity130 , daughter of former @entity132 mayor @entity131 , recalled seeing a teammate , naked and running out of @entity23 's bed during one road trip			1
she told her father , who called the teammate 's parents -- only to be told that they " wanted to keep it quiet			0
" " but i did bring @entity23 down to my office , " @entity131 said			1
" and he denied everything			0
" most parents had no idea what was happening , partly because they 'd signed a waiver that barred them from attending practices			0
by talking now , these women -- now in their 40s and 50s -- say their main focus is not necessarily to bring more charges against @entity23			1
rather , they want to make sure that no other girls , from here on out , have similar stories			0
@entity56 began spearheading the effort after , about six years ago , she discovered that @entity23 was " still coaching			1
" " i just kept seeing his name and seeing his name and i thought to myself , i ca n't let this man continue coaching , " a tearful @entity56 recalled			2
in 2008 , she contacted @entity58 president @entity165 , who encouraged her to speak to her former teammates			2
several of them ended up writing letters detailing alleged abuse , spurring an official investigation one year later			0
" the biggest challenge with this particular case was that it happened 30 years ago and , not only that , he had been acquitted , " @entity171 said			0
@entity23 maintains some support -- including from @entity176 , whom he coached at the @entity177 in 2005 , 2007 and 2009			1
" i obviously do n't want to believe it , but all i can share is the good experience i had , " said @entity176 , adding that she neither witnessed nor experienced abuse			2
@entity58 concluded its investigation in 2010 by putting @entity23 on its permanently ineligible coaches list			1
that means he can not coach at a @entity58 member gym , though he still can at a non-affiliated gym			2
and he did just that , at a facility in @entity188 owned by a coach once convicted of a sex offense involving a gymnast			2
" that really made me angry , made me livid , " said @entity192 " that someone like that , with such a history of abuse can still be able to coach in this field of gymnastics			1
" today , @entity176 says that @entity23 is no longer coaching -- adding that , with that , she 's not sure what his critics are trying to accomplish			2
but his accusers say that 's not the point			0
" this is about a group of women who want no more harm coming to any children for the sake of becoming a competitive athlete , " @entity1 said			0
@entity0 's @entity214 contributed to this report .			2

women claim gymnastics coach @entity23 physically , sexually abused them
they *decided* to speak now , decades later , hoping that he wo n't coach again
he did not respond to @entity0 , but has claimed that his accusers are lying
