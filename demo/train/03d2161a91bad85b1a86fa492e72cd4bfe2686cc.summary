-- sen. @entity1 of @entity2 is giving people whiplash			1
in the last month , he has shifted , flip - flopped and pandered so strikingly on a range of positions and statements that it makes you wonder whether he has suddenly developed a deep disregard for his own convictions , or never had any to begin with			1
at the @entity13 's @entity12 in @entity14 in july , @entity1 expressed support for the 1964 @entity16 and the @entity17 and talked about the necessity of protecting the rights of minorities			1
kudos to him for even showing up , not a usual move for @entity23			0
but we must hold him accountable for his past statements that private businesses had the right to deny service to anyone they wanted , something the @entity16 specifically forbids			0
last year when the @entity32 struck down key provisions of the @entity17 , @entity1 seemed to suggest it was n't necessary , since we had an " @entity36 president			1
" just a few days ago , in a flip - flop worthy of the @entity39 , a straight faced @entity1 denied ever saying the @entity40 should stop sending any military aid to @entity42			1
does he really think that little of @entity36 voters ? let 's refresh the senator 's memory			1
in 2011 , @entity1 put forth a budget proposal that would have cut $ 500 billion from the federal budget and would have ended all foreign aid , including to @entity42			1
he has since engaged in pretzel - like messaging maneuvers trying to rewrite history to fit reality -- one where a @entity23 candidate perceived as even the slightest bit @entity56 can kiss any chance of the @entity23 presidential nomination good - bye			0
or at least more cringe - worthy			0
@entity1 has repeatedly said he is a huge proponent of immigration reform and understands how wrong his party has been on this issue			1
frankly , this is one instance on which i have given @entity1 props for being on the right side of history , the @entity36 people and the long - term viability of his party with at least a glimmer of hope and an opening to start a conversation with @entity77 voters			1
that hope fizzled recently when first , @entity1 decided to go campaign for rep. @entity80 of @entity81 , the most anti-immigrant / anti-immigration reform member of @entity83			1
then , in a grand gesture , a profile in courage , @entity1 could not have fled faster as @entity87 , an undocumented " dreamer " confronted @entity80 at an event , with @entity1 sitting right next to him			1
according to his staff , @entity1 left so abruptly because he was late for a media interview			2
or maybe , he did n't have the guts to reconcile his hypocritical pro-immigration reform statements with his support of someone like @entity80			0
at least @entity80 , who stayed and spoke with the young woman , had the courage of his convictions , twisted as they are			0
maybe there is something in the water in @entity81			0
or something in the voters			0
oh , yes , they get to decide presidential nominees			0
that must explain why @entity1 , in another rewrite of his record , said he did n't think anyone there wanted to ban birth control			2
this is a tad bit different from reality			0
@entity1 's staff should remind him we can all do internet searches for what our elected officials have said and done in the past			1
in 2013 , @entity1 introduced the personhood amendment that would not only have banned abortions but also would have in effect banned many forms of birth control , including some forms of the pill			2
@entity1 also supported the @entity128 , which would have given employers an excuse to deny contraceptive health care coverage based on their conscience			2
when this was defeated in the @entity135 and the issue made its way to the @entity32 in the form of the @entity140 case , @entity1 praised the decision that lets employers deny such coverage on religious grounds			2
every one of these flips underscores how the @entity23 has flopped in gaining traction with key demographics it will need to be competitive in a 2016 general election			0
this last one underscores how nervous @entity23 are that even in the midterms , the ever - growing gender gap might be big enough to deny the " @entity23 wave " the party is dreaming about -- and that would include taking over the @entity135			0
as a strategist , i understand @entity1 's ( and his party 's ) frustration and the need to try to bamboozle the public into thinking he supports something he has denied in the past , and sometimes vice versa			1
but as a woman and a @entity77 , a member of two key constituencies where @entity23 desperately need to gain support if they are ever to see the inside of the @entity170 , i am offended			0
this is not @entity173 's " 1984			0
" @entity1 does not get to rewrite history and pretend he is not doing so .			2

@entity176 : @entity1 has been shifting positions so often , it could give you whiplash
she says he 's talking now about minorities ' rights , but previous statements will haunt him
she says he denies saying @entity40 should stop aid to @entity42 . but he did . voters can use @entity189
his moves on *reproductive* rights , immigration will *alienate* groups he needs , she says
