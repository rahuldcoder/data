-- @entity1 on thursday issued a first - person account of the incarceration and torture in @entity5 of one of its consultants -- an outspoken human rights advocate , journalist and blogger			1
@entity11 holds his baby in an undated family photo			1
" the torture of @entity11 : how the @entity20 , " recounts @entity17 's 22 - hour incarceration last may in the southern @entity19 country			1
@entity17 was blindfolded and taken at gunpoint from his home in front of his wife and infant child , according to the account			1
he was beaten and threatened during the ordeal , retold in the 39 - page report			0
@entity1 says the report " highlights abuses under the country 's state of emergency and the interim government 's failure to restrain the security forces			0
" " i have a moral responsibility to tell this story , " said @entity17 , who has done free - lance reporting for news organizations including @entity0			1
" i 'm going to tell my story again and again and again , " @entity17 told @entity0			1
" it 's not only my story			0
" @entity17 is one of tens of thousands of people , the report says , who have been detained by security forces after a government with a " reform agenda " came to power in january 2007			1
it says @entity17 was punished for criticizing " the security forces ' role in extrajudicial killings , torture , arbitrary arrests , and other abuses			1
" he described being taken to a small room that resembled a " torture cell " and being severely beaten			0
then his interrogators took off his blindfold to have him write a " confession " of his crimes			0
" i was sitting in front of a table and three batons were on the table along with some stationery			0
one was a wooden baton , about a meter long			0
the other two were covered with black plastic			0
poking out of the end of these two were metal wires , " @entity17 recounted			1
" i 'm not sure if they used electricity on me			0
the pain often came like shocks , but they were hitting me so hard that i 'm not sure whether it was just the force that hurt like this or if it was electricity			1
" @entity17 is now a consultant for @entity1 in @entity77 , which gave him and his family asylum after the ordeal			1
" rampant illegal detention and torture are clear evidence of @entity5 's security forces running amok , " said @entity80 , the @entity19 director of @entity1 who was quoted in a news release about the report			2
" @entity11 's prominence as a critical journalist may have prompted his arrest , but it also may have saved his life			1
ordinary @entity5 held by the security forces under the emergency rules have no such protections			2
" @entity17 was freed " after tremendous international and national pressure , " the group said			1
@entity1 is calling for the government in @entity5 " to make the protection of human rights as much of a priority as its fight against corruption			1
" " while few would dispute that corruption , organized crime , politicization of the bureaucracy and political violence had to be addressed in @entity5 , the interim government must realize that reform can not be built on midnight knocks on the door and torture , " said @entity80			2
" a peaceful democratic society requires respect for basic rights			2
" @entity80 said there have been " no serious attempts " to hold people accountable for torture and arbitrary detentions			2
it urged the international community to persuade the government to deal with these matters			0
" the security forces have been arbitrarily detaining and torturing people , but there have been no serious attempts at holding those responsible for these criminal acts to account , " said @entity80			0
" why has n't the government made the protection of @entity5 from this scourge a priority ? are they reformers , or do they just say they are reformers ? " @entity5 government officials could not immediately be reached for comment			2
@entity17 , contacted in @entity77 by @entity0 , said he wants justice for himself and the many others who have gone through the same ordeal			2
" i absolutely want to see the people responsible for my torture and for my detention tried in a court of law in a transparent way			0
i want justice , " he said			0
at the same time , he said , " i am fully aware this is not going to happen " at this time , given the mindset of the government			0
