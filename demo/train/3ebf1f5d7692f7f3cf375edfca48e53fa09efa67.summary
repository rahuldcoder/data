" the bloodshed which i regret so much in @entity14 has nothing to do with @entity104 , nothing whatsoever , " @entity106 said in an interview with @entity0 on monday			1

" and we do n't take any advantage of the civil war in @entity14			1
we do n't consider that we should or can intervene			0
" he added , however , that " if they want to have an additional war ... well , that 's their choice			0
" the @entity135 reported that there was no damage and no injuries , but the latest fire portends how what 's happening in @entity14 could seriously rattle the entire region			1

we believe that @entity104 is not the target here			2
we are looking at either stray bullets or stray mortars			0
" @entity106 said he hopes @entity14 wo n't make the same mistake again			1
@entity14 " must understand their own limitations , " he said			2
" but if it ever happens , we shall defend ourselves -- that 's what i can say			0
i do n't want to exaggerate and to make great declarations and bellicose interests			0
" @entity106 continued , " no , we are not interested			2
we understand that @entity14 has enough problems of their own			2
and it does n't give us again any pleasure			0
but if they endanger our lives , we shall defend ourselves			0
that 's what i can say in a certain manner			0
and i do n't want to fire declarations because i do n't like fire -- unnecessarily anyway			2
" @entity156 @entity190 ban ki - moon reacted with a statement sunday saying he " is deeply concerned by the potential for escalation			1

@entity104 's ambassador to the @entity43 , @entity202 , told @entity0 sunday that " a greater possibility " from the exchange of fire " is the inundation of refugees -- @entity208 , @entity148 , @entity149			1
" " we 'd give them refuge , " @entity202 said			0
" these are populations with which we have good relations			0
we 've been prepared for it for a long time , but it has n't happened			0
" @entity106 , asked whether @entity104 would accept refugees from @entity14 , said : " there are 24 @entity45 countries			1
there is one @entity147 country			0
why should they come to @entity104 ? " he noted that there are @entity227 in @entity104 , " and we respect the @entity227 here			2
" but , he said , " to add more does n't make sense			0
there is a huge @entity45 world			0
@entity104 is ... of the space of the @entity237			2
... they want to be @entity227			0
they want to be nations			0
why create an artificial problem ? what for ? " the solution , he said , is " to stop the war and not create more refugees			0
" sunday 's incident in the @entity110 area is the fourth @entity156 complaint @entity104 has filed			1
so far no one has been injured			0
