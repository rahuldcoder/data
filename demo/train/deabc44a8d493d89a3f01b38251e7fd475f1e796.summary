-- a virulent strain of @entity2 that has killed 18 people in @entity4 has not affected produce in the @entity6 , according to food safety and health officials who conceded friday there 's much to learn about the organism			1
even as efforts continue to determine what caused the outbreak , cucumbers , tomatoes and lettuce imported from @entity18 and @entity19 will be tested and cleared before they are sold in the @entity6 , according to @entity21 of the @entity22 , and the results will be shared with the @entity24			1
" i want to emphasize that this outbreak has not affected the @entity6 , " @entity21 told reporters in a conference call			1
" produce remains safe , and there is no reason for @entity6 to alter where they shop , where they buy or what they eat			1
" two adult women and an adult man who traveled last month to northern @entity18 remain hospitalized in the @entity6 with hemolytic uremic syndrome -- a form of kidney failure -- said @entity39 of the @entity40			1
those three cases were reported in @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			0
a fourth person developed bloody diarrhea , but was not hospitalized , he added			2
two @entity6 service members in @entity18 also developed diarrhea , @entity39 said			1
" we have no expectation that this will spread in our country			0
" the e. coli infection has spread to 12 countries and is blamed for at least 18 deaths -- all but one reported in @entity18			1
about 1,800 people have been sickened			2
the @entity55 initially said enterohemorrhagic @entity2 ( @entity56 ) , a strain of @entity2 , was found in organic cucumbers originating from @entity19 , packaged in @entity18 and distributed to various countries			1
but authorities have said that the source of the contamination has not been pinpointed			0
the @entity62 , @entity18 's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention , has advised @entity18 consumers not to eat raw tomatoes , cucumbers and lettuce			2
@entity18 and @entity19 account for a small fraction of produce that is sold in the @entity6 in a given year			1
officials said tracking the source of the illness could be difficult			0
if it , in fact , stems from the produce , the tomatoes , cucumbers and lettuce could have been eaten together in a salad			2
" we do n't know yet what is the cause and each of these ( vegetables ) , individually or perhaps in some combination , appear as likely culprits , so i do n't think we know enough to hypothesize at what point in the supply chain contamination may have occurred , " said @entity81 of the @entity22			0
" we do n't know which one that actually had the contamination in it			0
" the @entity40 is warning any @entity6 citizens who have recently traveled to @entity18 to seek immediate medical care if they begin to show symptoms of the bacterial infection			1
@entity39 said officials were unable to identify the source for an outbreak of this e. coli strain in the republic of @entity103 in 2009			0
the strain is more common among women and adults , he said , and officials are not certain how it may be associated with produce			0
" we have a lot to learn about this particular organism , " @entity39 said			0
the officials told reporters the @entity6 @entity112 signed by president @entity113 this year provides steps that minimize the risk of @entity2 at @entity6 farms and production facilities			2
" we believe prevention is superior to responding to an outbreak such as this one , " @entity81 said .			0
