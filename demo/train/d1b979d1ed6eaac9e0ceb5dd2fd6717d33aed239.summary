-- people with depression are more likely to have a stroke than their mentally healthy peers , and their strokes are more likely to be fatal , according to a new analysis published this week in the @entity7			1
depression is a relatively minor risk factor for stroke compared to high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and other health conditions and behaviors that damage blood vessels , the researchers say			1
still , their analysis suggests that as many as 4 % of the estimated 795,000 strokes that occur in the @entity18 each year can be attributed to depression			0
" if you have depression but no other health issues , you probably do n't have to pay too much attention to stroke risk , " says @entity19 , @entity20 , the lead author of the analysis and a research fellow at the @entity23 , in @entity24			1
" but if you are depressed and are also obese , or have hypertension or ... unhealthy lifestyle factors , your risk is going to increase dramatically			1
" @entity0 : the 10 most depressing states in the @entity18 @entity19 and his colleagues combined data from 28 studies dating back to the mid- 1990s that included about 318,000 people overall			2
roughly 2.7 % of the participants had a stroke during the studies , which ranged in length from two to 29 years			0
compared to those who showed no signs of depression , people who received a depression diagnosis from a doctor or who reported feeling depressed were 45 % more likely to have a stroke and 55 % more likely to die from a stroke , the researchers found			1
@entity2 increased the risk of ischemic stroke , in which a blood vessel becomes blocked and can not send blood to the brain			1
but it did not measurably raise the risk of the other major type , hemorrhagic stroke , in which a blood vessel leaks or bursts open			1
@entity0 : 12 signs of depression in men the new study is the latest in a long line of research linking depression to chronic disease and serious physical health problems			0
" we knew that depression raises a person 's risk of developing diabetes , obesity , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease , " @entity19 says			0
" we also knew that depression can occur after patients suffer a stroke			0
we just did n't have strong enough evidence to know if the reverse was true , or what really comes first			0
" researchers have already established that depression increases the risk of heart attacks ( and especially fatal ones ) , so it makes sense that depression would have a similar association with stroke , says @entity89 , @entity90 , a clinical professor of psychiatry at the @entity92 , in @entity93 " @entity94 and heart attacks both represent blood vessels becoming blocked and blood being withheld from a vital organ , whether it 's the heart or the brain , " says @entity89 , who was not involved in the new study			1
" they 're essentially the same disease			0
" @entity0 : careers with high rates of depression @entity2 could contribute to strokes in many ways , @entity19 says			2
for starters , people who are depressed are more likely to smoke or drink heavily , to follow an unhealthy diet , and to neglect their personal health			1
most of the studies included in the analysis controlled for these and other risk factors , but the data suggests that at least some of the stroke risk in depressed people can be explained by an unhealthy lifestyle			1
there are other possibilities , as well , that are n't as easily measured			0
@entity2 can increase the production of stress hormones in the body , for instance , and can trigger dangerous inflammation in the blood vessels			2
" little things , like keeping up good dental hygiene or socializing with friends , all affect inflammation levels -- and these are things that a depressed person is less likely to do , " says @entity89			0
@entity2 may also cause people to slack on taking medications needed to control other stroke - related conditions , such as diabetes or high blood pressure			1
on the other hand , some medications prescribed for depression -- most notably the class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics -- have been shown to cause weight gain and obesity , a known risk factor for stroke			2
more research is needed to determine whether depression drugs contribute to stroke risk			2
doctors should monitor weight gain and blood pressure levels in patients taking these drugs , but there 's no reason for patients to stop taking them , @entity19 says			0
" for now , physicians should prescribe medication if they think it is necessary , or if non-drug treatments have n't worked			0
" although depression is n't the most important risk factor for stroke , the researchers say it likely has a noticeable impact on the stroke rate			2
they estimate that depression is responsible for an additional 106 strokes per 100,000 people in the @entity18 each year			0
