@entity0 , @entity1 -- my son @entity3 called me at work one morning recently			1
he wanted to know my thoughts about the word " mankind " and whether it 's ok to use the term in an essay			1
so i blurted out , " not if you do n't want to exclude more than half of the human race ! " only then did i learn i was on the speaker - phone with other students in the principal 's office listening			1
so i asked the boys in the room the question : " would you feel left out if you were referred to as part of ' womankind ? ' " the answer was , of course , yes			1
with my son 's innocent question , memories flooded back of all those times at work as a journalist in the newsroom when the male reporters were sent out on the big stories , but not the women			1
it reminded me of that same left - out feeling i had the first time i saw a " @entity39 " construction sign on the roadside			2
the sign made me wonder where the women were			2
why did n't they get those jobs digging ditches and waving orange flags in the fresh air ? sometimes there would be a woman on the job site			0
but you would n't know it from the sign			0
now that women constitute fully half the work force , the signs and words that exclude them seem even more noticeable and incongruous			1
conversations that omit one group or another have no place in organizations that value diversity			1
in the workplace , we try to steer away from terms that alienate certain people			0
such sensitivity helps with little things such as office culture , retention , productivity and profitability			0
plus , it 's the right thing to do			2
despite much progress , most women in business can still relate to being left out of discussions daily			1
it 's most pronounced in male - dominated professions			2
" when i read something that refers to everyone as ' men ' -- that bothers me , " says @entity82 , one of few women captains operating charter trips through the @entity86 isles			2
@entity82 , who spent much of her career in the competitive world of sales for telecom conglomerates , became comfortable early on as an outsider			0
" i 'd be in a conference room with 15 guys			0
a lot of times i 'd feel excluded cause it was the good ol ' boys network			1
i do n't take it personally			0
" still , when the ceo asked , " gentlemen , what do you think ? " from the back of the room , @entity82 wondered " what about me ? " @entity110 's only female corporate officer can relate			1
in an interview with @entity114 magazine , @entity111 said , " during the ' warm - up ' conversations before big meetings , all the guys will discuss some big game that happened last night or last weekend			0
it 's not inclusive -- and not just to women who are n't into sports			1
" just sharing stories like @entity111 's and @entity82 's raises awareness and shifts culture , even if just slightly			2
it 's amazing how simply considering something like the words we use can result in change and greater inclusiveness			1
not everyone sees the need : @entity134 editor - in - chief @entity135 for one			0
i remember him glaring at me across the table at lunch one day a few years ago in the @entity134 dining room , saying : " @entity142 , if it 's a good stock price -- it 's a good stock price whether you 're a man or a woman			1
what difference does it make ? " it makes a big difference			0
what @entity135 and so many others miss is that when you do n't speak directly to your audience , they do n't hear you			0
that 's why so many women tune out when stories and pictures of men , often only men , fill the pages of @entity134 , or when network tv shows feature only male experts			1
women will wonder , " what about me ? " but does all this fuss cross the line of political correctness ? are we becoming overly concerned to the point of absurdity ? before answering those questions ; consider this question			1
is it absurd that while women now have parity in numbers in the workplace , they still lag far behind men in pay and position ? and yet , we put up with this just as we tolerate language that undermines women			2
historically , one can argue that words such as " man " and " mankind " were never intended to be sexist			1
after all , the word " man " comes from the @entity189 " manu " which means human being			2
" mankind " comes from @entity193 , ' homo ' ( human and humanity ) meaning both male human and human being in general			2
yet , @entity201 dictionaries , such as @entity202 define " man " first , as " an adult male human			0
" and this is a common interpretation			0
let 's face it -- men are n't the only ones to blame here			2
old habits die hard even for those with the best intentions			0
growing up in @entity214 , just about everyone , myself included , used the phrase " you guys			0
" during one news interview on the " @entity39 " signs issue , i found myself , saying , " well as you guys know ... " oops			0
even the best leaders will lapse into familiar territory , resorting to language and behaviors they 're used to			0
but the real test is this : when we use a particular word or phrase , will others feel ostracized ? of course in many cities across the country , you 'll still see those pesky " @entity39 " signs -- which , by the way , could jeopardize states from receiving @entity240 dollars , since the @entity241 requires that all signs be consistent with their 700 - page manual			1
" @entity245 " is the accepted language			0
it may not be always possible to use inclusive language , but it 's worth trying			0
anyway , how hard is it to use the word " humankind " when referring to all people ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			1

@entity254 asked son , boys if they would feel left out if called a part of " womankind "
@entity254 's question was to show why women and girls might feel excluded by word " mankind "
words excluding females seem antiquated now that women are half the workforce , she says
good : phrases that omit a group have no place in organizations valuing diversity
