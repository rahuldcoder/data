-- for some @entity1 , 2016 is 1992 : hating @entity2 is chic again			1
only more so , since the former secretary of state is also the partner of and potential successor to the last two @entity7 presidentsâ € ” @entity8 and @entity9			1
some of us believe , with good reasons , that the @entity1 are " mad - dogging " @entity2 with the @entity13 hearing to damage not only her presidential prospects , but also to damage president @entity9 's credibility			1
polls show @entity9 is trusted more than his @entity18 opponents , especially on the economy			0
so , to defeat his economic agenda and substitute their own , which has already lost on logic , they 've decided to undermine @entity9 's credibility and authority			0
the @entity13 hearing , which @entity28 speaker @entity27 , @entity29 , orchestrated and planned for months , is a classic " killing two birds with one stone " scenario for @entity1			1
or maybe three : they see an opportunity to smear @entity9 , sabotage @entity8 and fundraise like giddy televangelists			1
@entity13 hearing chairman @entity35 , @entity36 , said @entity8 is not a target of his committee			1
that does n't seem to jibe with statements by @entity1 sens. @entity41 of @entity42 and @entity43 of @entity44 , among others			1
and further contradicting @entity35 's protestation , the @entity46 was boasting that its @entity8 / @entity13 fundraising page was the most successful in its history			1
@entity13 is a rather unseemly subject to turn into a political weapon			1
it 's one thing to try to drag the former secretary of state through the mud			0
but the @entity1 are trying to drag her through blood -- blood that 's tainted with partisan politics			1
the @entity1 cut the funding for embassy security by $ 128 million in 2011 and $ 331 million in 2012			1
@entity8 warned that doing so would be " detrimental to national security			2
" republicans scoffed then , scream now			0
@entity9 called the @entity13 hearing a circus			2
it 's not a transparent , due process hearing			0
@entity7 have complained they were excluded from much of the investigations , were n't allowed to call witnesses or to look at documents			1
as rep. @entity69 , @entity70 and ranking member of the @entity72 , said wednesday after the @entity28 's release of approximately 100 pages of e-mails relating to the attacks in @entity13 : " these documents undercut the reckless accusations by @entity1 that the @entity28 scrubbed the @entity13 talking points for political reasons and in fact show just the oppositeâ € ” that the primary goal was to protect the @entity85 's ongoing criminal investigation and our nation 's intelligence operations			1
" @entity89 : @entity9 has explaining to do on @entity13 a transparent , due - process hearing would call the witnesses who would testify that the @entity93 @entity92 in @entity94 mistakenly believed @entity95 in @entity13 had claimed credit for the attack			1
the group did n't make the claim and later denied any role			0
but that was an on - the - ground , in - the - moment embassy mistake			0
( while no friend of the @entity93 , the @entity104 organization has not , so far , been implicated in terrorist activity			0
) it came from mistaken identity : there were two distinct and unrelated @entity95 militant groups in @entity111			0
even @entity112 interviewed an expert , @entity113 of the @entity114 , who said these groups have no formal affiliation with each other			0
they are grass - roots up organizations , whereas @entity120 organizes from the top down			0
it is suspected that the @entity95 in @entity123 was involved in the attack in @entity13 that killed four @entity93			2
its leader is a former prisoner at @entity127 who was released under the @entity129 administration and deported to @entity111 for jail			0
in a transparent hearing we would learn that the @entity1 ' chief witness , deputy chief of mission @entity135 , was likely , even today , in error about which @entity95 was involved			2
it is the difference between a local militant militia group and professional terrorists			0
@entity135 clearly was referring to the @entity142 when he testified about his concern that ambassador @entity144 was taken to the hospital that the @entity13 group then guarded			2
but , this week the same hospital was bombed ; the rival @entity146 in @entity123 , with @entity120 links , is a reasonable suspect			0
getting the facts right matters			0
posturing for propaganda points not only misleads us , it endangers us			0
for whatever the @entity13 hearings are about , they 're not about learning the lessons from this tragedy and improving securities at @entity93 embassies and other facilities overseas			1
they are , in fact , a partisan campaign fundraiser for the @entity1 , and not a fact - finding inquiry to help the @entity165 and military correct their mistakes			2
@entity170 's @entity169 has already taken on @entity2 , spending megabucks on a 2016 attack ad that savages her judgments			0
some republicans , to their credit , ca n't stomach any more from their fellow @entity1			2
former secretary of defense @entity177 , a @entity1 , appeared on @entity179 ' " @entity180 " and said he would have handled @entity13 just as @entity9 handled it			1
he added a flat , " no " that he did not think @entity2 would be involved in any kind of a cover - up			0
@entity183 , conservative editor and commentator , told @entity112 sunday , " i wish the @entity1 would just be quiet for a while and that the partisan @entity1 groups that are fundraising off this would be quiet ... for a while ... and let 's find out what really happened			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : @entity13 hearings aimed at *hurting* @entity8 prospects for 2016
she says hearings cooked up by @entity27 . @entity1 says not aimed at @entity8 , but statements belie this
she says @entity7 excluded from much of probe , *including* calling witnesses who could shed light
@entity192 : facts , truth matter , but hearings aimed at fundraising for 2016 race against @entity8
