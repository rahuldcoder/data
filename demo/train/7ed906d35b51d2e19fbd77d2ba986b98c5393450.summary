( but , if that were the case , i would n't have anything to write about , now would i ? ) a recent tweet by a potential @entity36 employee , for example , turned ugly when he decided to tout a recent job offer : " @entity36 just offered me a job ! now i have to weigh the utility of a fatty paycheck against the daily commute to @entity42 and hating the work			1
" unfortunately for " theconnor " ( the handle for the would - be employee ) , @entity47 , a " channel partner advocate " for @entity36 , saw the tweet and responded with this : " who is the hiring manger , i 'm sure they would love to know that you will hate the work			0
we here at @entity36 are versed in the @entity56			0
" terrible tweets everyone has their " my - job - sucks , " " i - hate - my - co - workers , " or " give - me - more - money " moments			2
but , they seem to forget that as employers increase their online presence using social networking sites as recruitment and branding strategies , it might be best for their career not to have these moments on the @entity72			2
@entity73 , a freelance / corporate web marketer and blogger , found several of such moments on @entity77 , a social networking and micro-blogging site , and posted these " @entity80 to get you fired " [ sic 'd ] : 1			1
" hate my job ! ! i want to tell my bosses how dumb they are and how meaningless this job is , then quit , and be happy ! " 2			2

" huh , with my boss on twitter , maaaybe i should take down that sexy picture of her ... but her reaction will be priceless ! " @entity124 fired @entity77 is not the only culprit in career self - destruction			1
@entity124 , a popular social networking site , has housed its fair share of user firings : @entity130 , a former employee for @entity131 of @entity132 , @entity133 , thought her job was boring -- and she said so on her @entity124 page , according to an article in @entity137			1
@entity130 was called into her manager 's office and handed a letter that cited her @entity124 comments as the reason for dismissal : " following your comments made on @entity124 about your job and the company we feel it is better that , as you are not happy and do not enjoy your work we end your employment with @entity153 with immediate effect			1
" an @entity156 article remembers @entity157 , the legendary young intern who e-mailed his boss , claiming a " family emergency " would keep him out of the office around @entity160			0
his co-workers ( and @entity124 friends ) , however , saw a photo of @entity157 dressed as a fairy at a @entity160 party time - stamped on the same day of the " emergency			1
" @entity157 's boss responded to him with an e-mail @entity170 'd to the entire company , firing him and including the incriminating fairy picture			0
in march 2009 , the same @entity156 article cites @entity174 , a @entity175 stadium employee , who was fired after slamming the football organization for trading a player in this status update : " @entity174 is [ expletive ] devastated about @entity179 signing with @entity180			1
@entity182 @entity181 ! ! [ @entity183 ] " two days later , the head of event operations said they needed to talk about his @entity124 status ; instead , he got the boot			1
@entity189 networking don'ts if you want to use your profile to get hired or -- or at least not get fired -- here are three basic rules to keep in mind : 1			1
do n't announce interviews , raises or new jobs as exemplified by " theconnor , " how you talk about any of these sensitive topics on your social networking site is key			2
if you 're unemployed , writing " interview today -- wish me luck ! " would be ok , or if you got a job , something along the lines of " so excited about my new job ! " is totally acceptable			2
if you 're currently employed , however , i do n't think your boss would be too happy to see something like , " trying to con my boss into giving me a $ 5k raise			1
do n't badmouth your current or previous employer just like in an interview , keep your rants about your boss or company to yourself			2
if hiring managers see that you 're willing to trash a colleague online they assume you 'll do it to them , too			0
plus , there 's always the possibility of getting fired if someone sees your negative comments			0
do n't mention your job search if you 're still employed if your boss knows you 're on the lookout for a new job , feel free to advertise it in your status			1
if you 're keeping your search below the radar , however , do n't publish anything , anywhere			1
even if you are n't connected to your boss online , somebody can get the information back to him or her			1
the information contained in this article may not be published , broadcast or otherwise distributed without the prior written authority			0

as social media increases , it is also becoming a way to get reprimanded or fired
touting a job offer or badmouthing your job could get back to the boss *upstairs*
the same rules for @entity77 also apply to your @entity124 status update
another good rule ? do n't mention your job search if you 're still employed
