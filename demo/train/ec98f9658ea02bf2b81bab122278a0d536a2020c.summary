-- @entity2 scientists say levels of polonium - 210 measured in the personal effects and body tissues of @entity8 leader @entity7 " moderately " support a proposition that he died of polonium poisoning			1
the findings released by the @entity13 of @entity14 of @entity15 -- first reported wednesday by @entity16 -- do not address how @entity7 , who died in 2004 at age 75 , might have been poisoned or who might have done it			1
the report comes a year after @entity7 's widow , suspecting he was poisoned , had the body exhumed for tests after the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 was found on some of his personal belongings in 2012			1
the @entity2 center said it identified " significant quantities " of polonium in biological stains on those belongings			2
some polonium also was found in samples of remains taken during last year 's exhumation , it said			1
what polonium does to the body the scientists ' findings may renew controversial allegations over how @entity7 -- the most prominent face of @entity8 opposition to @entity45 for five decades -- died			1
the @entity47 , which runs the @entity48 , has said @entity45 would have been behind any poisoning of @entity7 , who was regarded by many @entity8 as a father figure			1
" i believe that all fingers are pointed at the @entity45 occupation ... who have experience in such cases of poisoning , " said @entity51 , a member of the executive committee of the @entity53			0
@entity51 called for a " criminal international committee " to be formed to investigate the report			0
an @entity45 @entity63 spokesman said wednesday that any such accusation would be " utter nonsense			0
" " this is nothing to do with us , and for the moment they refrained ( from ) making accusations , " @entity45 @entity63 spokesman @entity66 said			0
" they know why -- there 's no strictly no connection to @entity45			2
" the @entity2 center pointed out some caveats : -- the testing was based on " very small specimens			2
" the center noted that blood , urine and other specimens were destroyed after @entity7 's hospitalization			0
-- eight years passed between the death and the exhumation			2
because polonium - 210 has a half - life of just 138 days , its detection after eight years is " very difficult and subject to uncertainties			1
" -- the " chain of custody " of @entity7 's personal effects -- from the time he died and when the center began to study them in 2012 -- is unclear , it said			1
@entity96 , a professor of radionuclide metrology in the physics department at the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , agreed that the years that have elapsed since @entity7 's death make it more difficult to estimate how much isotope was there originally			2
" it 's like a blindfolded man holding the tail of an elephant and using that to estimate the weight of the elephant , " @entity96 told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
" you can do it , but there is a huge amount of extrapolation involved			0
" and the mere presence of the isotope -- in amounts significantly higher than what occurs naturally -- does not necessarily mean that that is what killed @entity7 , he added , citing the scientists ' measurement of a urine stain on @entity7 's underwear			2
" if you were being cynical about such a thing , if you wanted to put a false trail out there , you could put a tiny amount of polonium 210 on that urine stain , " he said			1
" that does n't mean that the urine stain came from inside him			0
" @entity137 prosecutors launch murder inquiry in @entity7 's death but the report expressed doubt that that could have occurred			0
it said that @entity7 's widow had " certified that the measured personal effects have been stored in a secured room			2
" and biological samples -- including from bone -- also contained a higher concentration of the isotope , said @entity96 , who complimented the work of the @entity2 experts			2
" these are good forensic scientists , " he said			0
" these results imply that , at the time of his death , mr. @entity7 had an amount of polonium - 210 present in his system that would be significantly detrimental to his health			1
" how much would it take ? " it 's a terrifyingly small amount , " @entity96 said			0
" the size of a grain of salt , something like that			1
" @entity7 , who first led the @entity53 and then the @entity47 , died in a @entity167 military hospital in november 2004 after suffering a stroke after weeks of illness			1
@entity8 officials said in the days before his death that @entity7 had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems			1
rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but the @entity47 's then - foreign minister , @entity176 , said he " totally " ruled them out			0
@entity137 authorities -- responding to a request from @entity7 's widow -- opened a murder inquiry into his death in 2012 after high levels of polonium - 210 were detected on @entity7 's toothbrush , clothing and his keffiyeh , the trademark black - and - white headscarf he often wore			1
@entity137 opened the investigation partly because @entity7 died there			0
forensic experts from @entity2 and @entity190 took their own samples for independent analysis			0
radiation poisoning from polonium - 210 looks like the end stage of cancer , according to medical experts			1
the radioactive substance can enter body by eating or drinking contaminated things , breathing contaminated air , or inhaling or ingesting bodily fluids from someone contaminated with it			1
a wound can also become contaminated			0
@entity190 spy dies after polonium poisoning @entity0 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0

a dose " the size of a grain of salt , something like that " could be deadly , professor says
the @entity8 leader died in 2004 at age 75
last year , his widow , suspecting he was poisoned , had the body exhumed for tests
polonium - 210 -- a radioactive substance -- had been detected on his clothing and toothbrush
