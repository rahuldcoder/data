-- if you are like a lot of people , you 've probably thought about trying to find out more about your family history some day			1
how did your parents first meet ? where did your grandparents come from ? what were the family secrets that no one ever discussed ? two years ago , i set out to do just that			1
mine was a story with some superficial details that had always made for good dinner party conversation : my parents were an interracial couple who met in the mid- 1950s , when " miscegenation " was still illegal in most states in @entity22			1
my father was an undergraduate at @entity25 , the only black male student on campus			1
my mother was a white @entity29 professor who cast him in a student play			0
when they fell in love , they had to meet in secret for a year and a half until he graduated , after which they immediately married			1
they both came from fascinating backgrounds : he was the son of black undertakers from @entity44 , who had grown up in a world that was a cross between an @entity49 play and " @entity50			0
" she had come to @entity22 from @entity29 as a teenage refugee with five of her seven sisters while their father , a @entity56 pastor , stayed behind to organize the small mountain village where he preached to hide thousands of @entity58 from the @entity59			1
read an excerpt from " @entity61 " but as intriguing as those facts were , i knew that my family story did n't end there			1
it also included what happened after my parents divorced seven years later : my mother struggled with depression and financial hardship as she was forced to support my younger brother and me on her own			1
my father plummeted into an alcoholic spiral that destroyed his promising career as an @entity74 scholar			1
i battled loneliness and obesity and teenage fury as i coped with feelings of abandonment			0
i knew i could n't revisit the romantic aspects of the story without also reliving the tragic parts , and for most of my adult life i had no desire to do that			2
then , on the saturday after @entity86 , a year to the day after my father died , i woke up in the middle of the night with an urgent epiphany : i was finally ready to write my family 's story			1
i got out of bed and started recording memories on my laptop computer			0
but i quickly realized how much i did n't know , or was n't certain i recalled correctly			0
so i decided to tackle the project as a reporter , applying all the skills i had acquired in 35 years as a journalist			2
and for anyone who has thought about embarking on a similar journey , here are some of the lessons i learned : do n't take " i do n't remember " for an answer			0
many of the " sources " for my story -- my mother and her friends , my father 's older sister , his other wives and mistresses -- were now in their 70s or 80s			1
at first , they all insisted that they had forgotten most of what happened			0
but i asked to speak with them anyway , always arranging to meet them early enough in the day that they were n't tired and to make sure that they had all afternoon and evening free if necessary , so that we would n't be cut short			0
luckily , their mental faculties were still intact			0
once they got started , one memory led to another , and i ended up talking with them for hours and filling notebook after notebook			0
their recall became particularly sharp when they were telling me why something i thought i knew was wrong			0
the urge to correct the record , i discovered , is a powerful aide - memoire			0
look for every written document you can find			0
i asked all of my interview subjects to give me whatever they had on paper from the time : diaries , letters , academic notes and reports			2
some of it no longer had relevance , but the prospecting yielded many nuggets of gold			0
my mother found a diary that her father had written as a missionary in @entity74 in the 1930s , dreaming of returning to @entity156 to help battle @entity157			2
longtime friends gave me a series of letters that my mother had written in the happy early years of her marriage , when i was a toddler and my parents took me with them to @entity163 and @entity74 while they did field research			2
there was another batch from the ugliest days of their divorce , when we were living in @entity170 and she was on the verge of losing her mind			0
my father 's brother - in - law searched through a drawer and found a 12 - page testimonial that my black granddad dictated to an attendant in a nursing home on his 75th birthday			1
his " autobiography , " as he called it , recorded how he grew up on a tenant farm in @entity183 , the son of a sharecropper who was born a slave , and how he made his way north as a teenager to work in the @entity44 steel plants and then became one of the city 's first black funeral home owners			2
with the help of interlibrary lending and the @entity197 , i tracked down archives and out - of - print books and court records that helped paint a larger picture of the worlds that my parents and grandparents inhabited			2
thanks to @entity207 ' @entity206 , i was able to look at pictures of some of the many homes where i lived as a child , some remarkably the same as i remembered , others sadly gone or condemned			0
and like any good investigative reporter , i used the details i discovered in the written documents to question my sources again			1
these later interviews often elicited secrets that had n't emerged before -- like the grounds for my parents ' divorce , or the legal battle my father fought after being fired from one of his university jobs , or the details of the hard - core rehab facility where he stayed for six months to finally stop drinking			1
not everyone who reports their family story will be obsessed enough to write a book about it , as i have done			1
but you are bound to discover things that will surprise , amuse and even shock you			0
and if you 're like me , you will find it enlightening to start seeing your family members not just as forces in your life , but as characters in a drama -- shaped by historical time and geographical place and their own personal angels and demons , like protagonists in a novel			2
" was it therapeutic ? " people ask me , and the answer is yes , but in a different way from conventional treatment			0
call it " contextual therapy " : the placement of your own story in a wider human narrative , where every family story is utterly unique yet entirely universal			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			1

@entity262 set out to tell the story of his family , a year after his father died
his parents were an interracial couple who braved *prejudice* and faced many struggles
to tell your family 's story , act like a reporter , interview your older relatives , @entity262 says
search for any documents that could help and explore surrounding history
