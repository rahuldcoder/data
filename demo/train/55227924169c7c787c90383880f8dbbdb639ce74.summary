-- the families of @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and other unarmed black men felled by bullets or police force filled a podium in the nation 's capital			1
" this is a history - making moment , " said @entity5 's mother , @entity12			1
" it 's just so overwhelming to see all who have come to stand with us			2
look at the masses -- black , white , all races , all religions			0
... we need to stand like this at all times			0
" invoking the familiar names of black men who died at the hands of police , tens of thousands marched throughout the nation on saturday to protest what they see as rampant racial injustice			0
the throngs -- young and old , black and white -- took to the streets in major cities , including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40			1
in @entity36 , a crowd of thousands snaked up @entity42 to the @entity43 in a protest that evoked memories of past civil rights marches			1
the crowds appear to represent a burgeoning movement sparked by the decisions of grand juries in @entity51 and @entity35 not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men			1
@entity5 died in july when @entity35 police officers on @entity56 wrestled him to the ground , with one of the officers wrapping his arm around @entity5 's neck			1
' sea of people " " what a sea of people , " said @entity64 , the mother of @entity3 , who was fatally shot by a @entity66 , @entity51 , officer in august			2
" if they do n't see this and make a change , then i do n't know what we got to do , " thousands marched in @entity37 , starting at the @entity43			0
police arrested 23 people on disorderly conduct charges , according to the @entity75			0
one man was charged with assault and battery on a police officer			0
from @entity35 's @entity83 , thousands marched to police headquarters chanting " i ca n't breathe " -- @entity5 's last words -- and " how do you spell racist : @entity87			1
" the march was largely peaceful , although a protester from a splinter group hurled a garbage can through the window of an @entity87 traffic car			2
" i stand here as a black man who is afraid of the police , " said marcher @entity94 , " who is afraid of never knowing when my life might end , never knowing when i might be ... gunned down by a vigilante or a security guard or a police officer			0
" @entity102 , a writer and frequent @entity0 guest who participated in the march , said the demonstrations signal a lasting movement			0
" the collective self - esteem that 's happening with these young people is really powerful , " she said			1
" they know they are part of history			2
" protesters demand change in @entity36 , many carried signs with now familiar messages : " black lives matter , " " hold cops accountable " and " i ca n't breathe			1
" " it 's systematic racism that is instilled in our government , " said @entity119 , her hands in the air as she marched to the @entity43			1
" we come in peace but we come strong , " said @entity126 , daughter of the rev. @entity127 , an organizer of the @entity36 march			1
" we come with demands			0
we want the government to get involved			2
" protesters are demanding a more aggressive federal response to racially charged incidents involving police			1
another marcher was @entity137 , whose 12 - year - old son , @entity138 , was carrying a toy gun when a @entity141 police officer fatally shot him in a park			2
the local medical examiner ruled his death a homicide			0
@entity146 , head of the @entity147 , said protesters are demanding body and dashboard cameras for police , special prosecutors to investigate police misconduct and laws against racial profiling			0
@entity35 councilman @entity156 , who marched in @entity36 , said the protest needed to move beyond police brutality and focus on issues such as housing , unemployment and better schools			1
" that 's where we need to steer the conversation , " he said			2
" that 's where the anger is			0
" what the officers say @entity172 , the @entity35 police officer shown on video wrestling @entity5 to the pavement with his arm around his neck , spoke with internal affairs investigators this week			1
his attorney says @entity179 did not use a chokehold but a " takedown technique " he learned in the police academy			0
" he said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure mr. @entity5 , " attorney @entity183 said			1
police had confronted @entity5 on the sidewalk for allegedly selling loose cigarettes			1
@entity66 police officer @entity189 resigned from the department last month			0
he testified to a @entity192 grand jury that he shot @entity3 after the 18 - year - old tried to take his gun and then charged at him			0
the results of autopsies , including one by a @entity198 medical examiner , showed that among @entity3 's multiple gunshot wounds was one to his hand at close range			2
that supports @entity189 's account of a struggle at his patrol car but does n't explain why @entity189 continued shooting at least five more times			0
@entity0 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
