-- a relatively obscure drug used to treat mouth sores has made obese mice thin -- and the mice did n't have to eat less or exercise more , according to a study at the @entity6			1
doctors at the university will begin studies in human beings later this year			1
hopes are high , even though many drugs that work in mice do not work in humans			1
" it is a tour de force and offers a new and potentially exciting opening for developments of new anti-obesity drugs -- something which is badly needed , " says dr. @entity15 , chief of the @entity16 and @entity17 at @entity18 at @entity19			0
in the study at the @entity6 , researchers gave mice a high - fat diet , and they became obese			2
they then injected the animals with a drug called amlexanox , which has been on the market for more than 15 years to treat canker sores			1
the mice lost weight , even though they kept eating the same number of calories			1
when they were taken off the drug , the mice gained all the weight back			2
if amlexanox works in humans -- and that 's a big if -- @entity15 said it could become like the story of @entity41 , which was originally developed to treat one condition , chest pain , but serendipitously was later found to treat a different condition , erectile dysfunction			1
" it could well be that what works for one disease will turn out to work for another , even though that was n't the original intent , " he said			0
the researchers screened several drugs and found that amlexanox , used in an ointment to treat canker sores , changed the action of genes that control metabolism			1
when injected in mice , the drug worked by increasing metabolism , not by suppressing appetite			0
" one of the reasons that diets are so ineffective in producing weight loss for some people is that their bodies adjust to the reduced calories by also reducing their metabolism , so that they are ' defending ' their body weight , " says dr. @entity65 , the lead researcher at the @entity6			0
" @entity75 seems to tweak the metabolic response to excessive calorie storage in mice			0
" the findings were published sunday in the journal @entity80			0
clinical trials are expected to begin later this year to test the drug 's effectiveness in humans			1
in the mouse study , the researchers took pains to make sure that it was the drug , and not something else , that was making the mice lose weight			1
they used a laser machine to trace the mice to see if perhaps the weight loss was because they moved around more while on the drug			2
" they do n't move more			0
the movement is exactly the same			0
the increased energy expenditure was due to something called thermogenesis , meaning they generate a little bit of heat , " @entity65 said			0
if the drug helps humans lose weight , researchers would have to make sure it 's safe			2
" one concern will be whether these drugs , by increasing energy expenditure and body temperature , may have unintended consequences on other systems , such as the heart			0
" experts say that 's an especially important concern because if the drug is ever used in humans for weight loss , patients would likely need to stay on the drug indefinitely , or else see the weight return .			2

study : obese mice given a canker sore drug lost weight without cutting calories , moving more
doctors will begin testing the drug , amlexanox , in humans later this year
if the drugs works , it could be like @entity41 , which originally was meant to treat chest pain
