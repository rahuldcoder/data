now that a @entity2 grand jury has decided not to indict officer @entity3 , what will happen to the man who killed an unarmed teen in the line of duty ? technically , the 28 - year - old officer could have returned to his job at the @entity10			1
but many believe he will never work as a cop again			0
on saturday , @entity3 resigned from the force , his attorney confirmed to @entity15			1
the eight - year police veteran wrote in his resignation letter he was leaving to help protect his fellow officers and @entity20 residents			2
" it is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal , " he wrote in the letter , provided by his attorney			0
what @entity3 told the grand jury " it would be senseless for him to go back to @entity20 , " @entity15 legal analyst @entity27 said			1
" and i do n't even think he can go back to law enforcement , for the same reason			2
he is still now going to carry with him this mantle that he was the cop who killed the young black kid that sparked the controversy nationwide			0
" most people believe @entity3 will never again wear a badge			2
" if i 'm the mayor of @entity20 , believe me , you would want that cop out because you know that he will be controversial , " @entity15 legal analyst @entity37 said			1
" he will be distrusted by the citizenry and maybe subjected to abuse when he 's out on the street			0
it 's just going to be nothing but trouble			0
" how prosecutor defended grand jury 's decision more investigations @entity3 is still the subject of an internal investigation by the @entity10 over what happened on august 9 , the day he fatally shot unarmed teenager @entity54			1
and the @entity55 is conducting two civil rights investigations : one into whether @entity3 , who is white , violated @entity54 's civil rights , and the other into the police department 's overall track record with minorities			1
@entity27 says he believes the federal investigation into @entity3 's actions will lose steam			1
" a federal investigation for civil rights violation is very difficult to accomplish , " he said			0
" you really have to show that the person acted with the intent to take away your civil rights , meaning i did what i did because you 're black			0
that 's a protected class			0
" the decision to open a federal probe of the @entity20 shooting was largely political , he said			2
since the grand jury declined to indict @entity3 , one could conclude that the shooting was justified based upon @entity3 's and @entity54 's actions			1
" that 's more evidence that he acted in self - defense , " @entity27 said			1
' more stringent ' federal probe possible @entity37 said the lack of an indictment could push the federal government to " open a much more stringent and powerful investigation " of @entity54 's shooting			0
" now they know he 's not going to be prosecuted on a state level , and the feds have a right to do a completely independent investigation , and they 're not bound in any way by grand jury determination , " he said			1
whether the @entity55 brings charges , however , is another story			0
" as a general rule , the feds really only get involved when they have a really strong case			0
" i would n't imagine they 're going to swoop in on this one too quickly			0
" wrongful death lawsuit possible @entity54 's family will probably file a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity3 and the @entity10 , @entity37 and @entity27 said			1
the @entity107 recently hired famed pathologist @entity108 to conduct a second autopsy of @entity54 's body , which @entity37 says is a move presumably " to support a civil lawsuit for money damages later			0
" " they 're going to sue a lot of people , and there 's no reason not to , " @entity27 added			1
@entity37 said @entity54 's family could file a lawsuit against @entity3 and the police department under @entity121 of the @entity122 -- a federal statute that permits damages against state officials for violations of legal or constitutional rights			1
but , @entity27 points out , law enforcement officers are afforded certain legal protections			2
" we strap guns on them and say , ' go out there and put yourself in danger , ' " he said			0
" so they even have an extra level of immunity of sorts			0
... overall , @entity3 probably acted within the confines of what he 's supposed to do			1
" but @entity3 will forever be connected to this divisive case that sparked weeks of unrest in the @entity145 suburb			2
" @entity3 is going to have a tough time because even if the presumption was he did nothing wrong , that does n't matter			2
he is now the focus point for all the anger and animosity that exist in the black community			0
" complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity20			1

@entity3 resigned from the @entity10 on saturday
it 's not clear whether @entity3 will continue being an officer somewhere else , but *experts* doubt it
" it would be senseless for him to go back to @entity20 , " lawyer and analyst @entity27 said
the grand jury had considered charges ranging from *manslaughter* to murder
