-- as a first - grade teacher , @entity1 is exposed to a horrifying number of germs on a daily basis			1
" i 've been thrown up on ; they sneeze and cough on me			2
and lost teeth are a real big thing for first - graders , " said @entity1 , who teaches at @entity7 in the suburbs of @entity9			1
" they 're so cute and unaware , though			2
they 'll have boogers hanging out of their nose and will be talking to you and not think anything of it			0
some teachers flip out , but i tell my students , ' go get a @entity23 and wash your hands			0
' when they sneeze , i teach them to do it into their elbows			0
" on average , elementary school children get eight to 12 colds or cases of the flu each school year , according to the @entity32			1
for the older kids , it is about half that			1
teachers and parents commonly refer to it as the @entity39			0
but there are simple ways to keep your kids healthy			1
@entity1 , who is getting her son @entity44 ready to go to kindergarten , is n't worried			0
" i 've taught my kids healthy habits ; i 'm sure they 'll be fine , " @entity1 said			1
she makes sure they get plenty of sleep , exercise regularly and eat healthy food			1
she 's taught her children to wash their hands often , and she 's hooked antibacterial gels on their backpacks for when they ca n't			0
" i 'm not a germaphobe like some of my colleagues who have put antibacterial lotion all over the place : their cars , their classrooms , " @entity1 said			1
" i do feel like some germs are ok			0
" danger zones @entity67 candy stores : that 's what dr. @entity68 , a professor of pediatrics at the @entity70 and author of the book " @entity73 , " calls schools			0
" it is stunning how many times kids touch their faces and then touch other kids , " @entity68 said			1
" this is a very touchy - feely demographic , and that 's how we share germs			1
... and the little ones do n't have the same exposure to germs that we do , so until their immune systems get built up , they get sick			0
" schools are full of " hot zones " for germs , @entity68 says			0
" most people think that 's the bathroom , but it really is n't			0
" if he had to rank the germiest places in school , no. 1 would be the drinking fountain			1
it 's germier than the toilet seat , he says , but " does n't get disinfected as much			0
" plus , it 's the perfect spot for kids to ingest these microorganisms as they put their mouths on the stream of water -- or right on the fountain itself			1
@entity68 suggests teaching students to run the water a little first and then drink			0
or better yet , children should bring their own water bottles to school and not share them with anyone			1
cafeteria trays are another germ hot zone			0
" those do n't get wiped down nearly as well , " he said , recommending that kids bring the tray to their table and then use hand sanitizer before they pick up their food			1
" there is a real delicate balance though ; we do n't want to make kids paranoid , " @entity68 said			1
" we need to be prudent			0
germs for people who are healthy really are n't a big deal			1
" staying healthy @entity68 tells parents to make sure their children get enough rest			2
school - age children should get get 10 to 11 hours of sleep every night , according to the @entity32			1
sleep deprivation lowers the immune system 's ability to fight off infection			2
exercise , @entity68 says , is another effective way to keep kids healthy			1
he suggests a daily dose of 40 minutes of running - around time , even in the winter			2
if it 's cold , children need to keep their jackets zipped and hats on their heads			0
" your mother was right : studies have shown that people who do bundle up against the cold are less likely to catch colds later on in the year , " @entity68 said			1
your child 's diet also plays an important role in warding off illness			1
@entity160 rich in vitamin c ( @entity162 ) do n't keep colds away altogether , but they can shorten the length of a cold			2
and make sure little @entity166 or @entity1 gets a flu shot early in the season			2
in order to stop germs from ever entering the body , hand - washing is key			1
every year , @entity1 invites a nurse to teach her first graders the proper techniques			2
" i 've got a bathroom with a poster about hand - washing right in my classroom , and if i do n't hear them wash their hands -- even if i 'm in the middle of a lesson and the principal is doing my evaluation -- i stop what i 'm doing and say , ' wash your hands , ' " @entity1 said			1
" it 's that important			0
" @entity190 , a foods and nutrition professor at the @entity192 , says studies she 's conducted show that most kids do n't know how to wash their hands properly ( only 28 % knew the right method )			2
properly washed hands cut down on gastrointestinal problems , as well as the cold and flu			2
@entity199 designed the " @entity201 , @entity202 ! " ( @entity162 ) hand - washing initiative			1
" i teach them to sing ' happy birthday ' to yourself twice to make sure they wash for at least 20 seconds , " @entity199 said			0
she also teaches them to clean between their fingers and around their fingernails and to use a clean paper towel or a hot air dryer to dry off			0
a lot of people think hand sanitizer is better , she says , but really , washing with soap and water is the most effective way to eliminate germs			1
" my kids are obsessed with hand sanitizer , " said @entity220 , a seventh - grade science teacher who teaches at @entity221 in the suburbs of @entity9			1
" it 's a part of the school supply list we send home for kids to bring , along with @entity23			1
i 'd prefer they wash their hands , but i know it will do in a pinch			0
" @entity220 used to think the " school plague " was more of an elementary school thing , but with increasing pressure to get good grades , some older students do come to school sick			1
and that gets others sick			0
" i 've never been a sickly person , but i did catch strep throat about three years ago , " @entity220 said			0
" i 've never had it in my entire life , but i had it			0
" @entity220 's been teaching for more than 20 years			0
she 's noticed that some of the newer teachers are getting sick more often			0
" when you are new , you are killing yourself to impress , and some young teachers really do forget to take care of themselves , " @entity220 said			0
she advises new teachers to make sure they keep up with their own healthy habits			2
" eat healthy , get sleep , do whatever you do to reduce stress			1
" @entity220 coaches her school 's @entity260 program			2
it helps her and her students decompress , as well as stay in shape			0
" that 's especially important for me as a teacher			0
i ca n't really miss school , " she said			2
" i 've got kids lined up at my door every morning			2
i need to be there for them			0
staying healthy is totally doable			2

@entity32 : elementary kids get eight to 12 colds or cases of the flu every school year
the " germiest " place may be the drinking fountain , expert say
