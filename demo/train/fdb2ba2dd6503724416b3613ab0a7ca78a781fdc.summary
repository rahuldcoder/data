-- few countries in @entity2 have suffered as much turmoil and internecine warfare in recent decades as @entity5			1
the " secret bombing " campaign in the early 1970s , orchestrated by the soon - to - be - impeached president @entity7 and his secretary of state , @entity9 , the most contentious of @entity11 winners , pushed many moderates towards the @entity14 , who stormed into @entity16 in april 1975 to declare victory and begin a reign of tyranny that some historians have called the most radical experiment in communism ever conducted			2
with an agenda of half - baked @entity24 and class warfare that included emptying cities , banning money , and executing intellectuals -- or anyone wearing glasses -- the @entity14 tried to create an agrarian utopia			1
instead , they wound up masterminding a genocide that left an estimated 1.7 million @entity33 dead			1
that legacy is on grim display in @entity16 's most popular dark tourism sites of the secret prison at @entity38 and the @entity39			1
textbook tortures known by the code name @entity38 , the former high school of @entity38 became the @entity14 's secret prison and the most potent symbol of its brutality			1
over the course of four years as many as 20,000 prisoners passed through here , including four @entity49 , one @entity50 and two @entity51			0
interactive : five faces of @entity5 's @entity14 only seven survived			1
upon arriving at the prison , each inmate was photographed			0
these black and white portraits hang in the second of four buildings			0
they are the most haunting part of this memorial site			0
some inmates are wide - eyed with fright			0
others appear resigned to their fate			0
others are women with babies			0
all of them put a human face on what was an inhuman regime hell - bent on extinguishing every last spark of individuality and family loyalty from its citizenry , for the @entity14 referred to itself only as " @entity77 " ( the @entity78 )			1
its leader was a paranoid megalomaniac whom , as @entity83 recounted in his comprehensive biography , " @entity85 : the history of a nightmare , " believed in preserving secrecy at all costs , to the point where his handwriting has never yet been identified			2
an ongoing struggle for justice after @entity14 building a has been preserved exactly as the @entity97 invaders , weary of @entity14 attacks , found it in early 1979 , right down to the bloodstains on the floor and the implements of torture left on the bed frames scabbed with rust			1
in another building , paintings by @entity106 , one of the seven survivors , illustrate in living colors how the prison 's torturers went about their deathly business , extracting the most trumped up confessions through the most barbaric of means			2
far from being a museum piece , the tragedy of @entity38 continues to play out in the last act of a un-backed genocide trial			2
the prison 's former chief , @entity119 , the alias of @entity122 , has already been sentenced to life in prison for war crimes , while two other members of the @entity14 top brass , @entity128 and @entity129 wait in the wings for their trials to begin			1
burial grounds the first time i visited the @entity39 outside @entity16 in 2003 , i was transfixed by a tree with a sign that read in @entity137 and @entity138 : " @entity140 tree against which executioners beat children			2
" that was done to save bullets			0
my driver pointed at nails sticking out of the tree -- they had been used to drive home the regime 's barbarity and speed up the executions			2
just then , a little girl appeared beside the tree , her face peeking over an urn stacked with bones that went up to her neck			0
she looked like a ghost , but in fact was one of the child beggars in the area			0
the tree still stands , but the urchins have been evicted			0
when local authorities renovated the @entity39 in 2011 , this series of mass graves , where the @entity14 executed and buried the prisoners trucked in from @entity38 , they turned it into a site that documents , with painstaking accuracy , the @entity174 ' atrocities			1
complete with a pagoda of skulls for an epicenter - piece , these burial grounds have a concussive impact on visitors			0
thanks to the refurbishments , you can listen to the strident battle hymns of the @entity14 once blasted from speakers to drown out the cries of the condemned men and women being beaten to death with the axles of oxcarts , or having their throats slit with the serrated edges of a palm frond			2
to really come to grips with @entity5 's dark past and understand why 70 % of its populace are under 30 , these two memorial sites stand as tombstones to those times of turmoil and the @entity33 ' courageous resilience in the face of peril			1
read more : 35 years on , top @entity14 leaders face justice in @entity5 @entity211 has worked as a writer and editor in @entity214 since 1992			1
his books include the acclaimed non-fiction collection , " @entity217 : tales of @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 " and a collection of short fiction , " @entity218 and @entity219 of @entity217			0

@entity5 does *n't* hide from its brutal past , with evidence of @entity85 's regime on show at @entity38 and the @entity39
@entity14 attempt to create an agrarian utopia left an estimated 1.7 million people dead
@entity38 's former chief , @entity119 , already sentenced to life in prison , other senior @entity14 *officials* await trials
