-- @entity1 has urged the world of golf to come together and unite over the controversial rule changes on putting			1
the @entity5 fears that the game could be torn apart with the @entity7 joining the @entity8 in opposing the proposed ban of advanced anchored putters from 2016			1
@entity14 's governing bodies , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) and the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , announced the plan last year with the 90 - day consultation period set to expire on thursday			1
the @entity11 is the rule - making authority throughout the world of golf , excluding the @entity19 and @entity20 where the @entity12 runs the sport			1
" anchored " putting method to be banned from 2016 @entity7 commissioner @entity23 has already stated that the organization did not see " a competitive advantage to be gained by using anchoring			1
" but @entity1 , who has previously spoken in favor of the ban , says a decision needs to be taken across the whole of the sport from the @entity7 to the @entity32			1
" i saw what @entity35 had to say and it seems like the @entity32 is going to go a different way , " @entity1 told a press conference ahead of the @entity34			2
" i read a thing @entity40 ( @entity41 ) said that this divide is n't good for golf and i do n't think it is			0
we either need to all be on one side or the other			0
" it 's up to the governing bodies at the end of the day to decide			0
i sort of think it was a bit of a knee jerk reaction to how much success people were having with it ( players using long putters have won three of the last five majors )			0
" i 'm all for people enjoying the game and trying to make the game as easy as possible and bringing people to the game , and if that means they should allow anchored putters to make it easier for the general public then that 's a good thing			0
" but then they talk about bifurcation , whether you should have one set of rules for us and one set for the amateurs and it 's just a bit of a mess and opened a can of worms			0
" @entity7 against ' belly putter ' ban the @entity7 runs the @entity19 circuit and plays a leading role in staging @entity84 events			1
it has traditionally adopted the rules of the @entity86 and @entity12 , which runs the @entity87 and @entity88 , while the @entity8 organizes the @entity90 and @entity19 @entity91 team			0
with the @entity32 already having announced its intention to abide with the @entity86 agenda , @entity1 feels the rest of the world should fall in line			0
he added : " we have put the game of golf in the hands of the @entity86 and @entity12 for i do n't know how many years and have always abided by the rules that they 've set and i do n't think there should be any difference			2
" if it were up to me , whatever decision the @entity12 comes to , maybe the pressure the @entity7 has put on them , they might change their minds and rethink about it , and if they do that it 's totally fine with me			2

@entity5 @entity1 wants *uniformity* over putter ban proposal
the @entity7 opposes the proposed ban of anchored putting in golf
the @entity12 and @entity11 plan to outlaw the *technique* by 2016
@entity7 says there is no *evidence* that using the " belly putter " offers an advantage
