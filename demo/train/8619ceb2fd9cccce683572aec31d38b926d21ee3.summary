a former @entity1 engineer has been charged with destroying 200 - plus text messages about the @entity3 , including one concluding that the undersea gusher was far worse than reported at the time			1
@entity8 faces two counts of intentionally destroying evidence requested by authorities , federal prosecutors announced tuesday			0
the charges mark the first criminal case brought in conjunction with the 2010 blowout in the @entity16 , which spewed nearly 5 million barrels of crude into the sea			1
mix had been assigned to estimate the size of the spill , and one of the messages investigators recovered " includes real - time flow - rate analysis " during an effort to plug the damaged well			2
that data contradicted the company 's public statements about the ongoing disaster , according to an @entity33 agent 's affidavit outlining the charges against him			0
the effort , called a " top kill , " involved plugging the ruptured deep - sea well by pumping heavy drilling fluid into it from the surface , nearly a mile above			0
" before @entity45 commenced , @entity8 and other engineers had concluded internally that @entity45 was unlikely to succeed if the flow rate was greater than 15,000 barrels of oil per day , " the @entity41 said in a statement announcing the charges			2
on the first day of the operation , @entity8 sent a message back to his supervisor that read , " too much flowrate -- over 15,000 and too large an orifice , " an @entity33 affidavit outlining the charges states			1
that data indicated " that @entity45 was not working , contrary to @entity1 's public statements at that time , " the affidavit states			2
when the operation began , the publicly announced estimate of the spill by @entity1 and federal agencies was 5,000 barrels a day , though @entity1 had acknowledged the amount was likely higher			1
the day after @entity8 's message , the @entity66 government raised its estimate of the spill amount to 12,000 barrels a day ; two days later , @entity1 announced that the " @entity45 " attempt had failed			1
according to the affidavit , an early estimate of the blowout @entity8 produced ranged from 64,000 barrels a day to 138,000 ; another ranged from 1,000 to 146,000 per day			0
the @entity75 ultimately concluded that about 59,200 barrels of liquid oil a day flowed from the well before it was capped , making it the worst oil spill in @entity66 history			2
in a statement issued tuesday , @entity1 said it was cooperating with @entity41 and other investigations into the spill , which lasted nearly three months			1
the company had no comment on the allegations against @entity8 but said it " had clear policies requiring preservation of evidence in this case and has undertaken substantial and ongoing efforts to preserve evidence			0
" mix , of the @entity95 suburb of @entity96 , resigned from @entity1 in early 2012 , the affidavit states			0
he made his first appearance before a federal judge in @entity95 on tuesday afternoon on the charges , which were filed in @entity100			0
prosecutors said @entity8 deleted a string of more than 200 messages from his iphone about october 4 , 2010 , after he had been told to collect electronic files related to the disaster and prepare to turn them over to a company working for the oil giant 's attorneys			1
he would face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 on each count if convicted			0
the @entity115 , a @entity100 - based environmental group , said it was pleased to see criminal charges stemming from the spill			0
" it is telling that the @entity41 's charges against @entity8 surround efforts to cover up the fact that @entity1 's public estimates of the oil flow rate were far lower than the actual flow rate , " the group said in a statement on the arrest			1
" establishing accurate flow rates is an important step forward in ensuring that @entity1 pays the highest possible price for every drop of oil that they discharged into the @entity16			1
" an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 206 million gallons ) of crude oil poured into the @entity16 after the april , 20 , 2010 explosion that sank the drill rig @entity3 and killed 11 men aboard			1
the disaster damaged the region 's fishing and tourism industries , a temporary federal ban on deepwater drilling left oilworkers idled , and scientists are still studying the long - term effects of the disaster on the @entity16 ecosystem			0
@entity1 announced last week that it had reached a settlement estimated at $ 7.8 billion with thousands of businesses and individuals who filed damage claims in the wake of the spill , and a federal criminal investigation of the disaster is ongoing			2
in september , a government report on the spill found that @entity1 , rig owner @entity159 and well cement contractor @entity157 shared responsibility for the explosion , but @entity1 was " ultimately responsible " for operations at the site			1
@entity1 and @entity157 sued each other in april 2011 , each claiming the other was to blame for the deadly explosion and resulting leak			0
a federal judge in @entity100 ruled this year that @entity157 is not liable for the some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties , leaving @entity1 on the hook for the majority of those claims , while a similar decision came down regarding @entity159 .			0

" too much flowrate -- over 15,000 , " one of the messages notes
