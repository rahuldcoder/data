@entity1 , @entity0 -- western cinema 's relationship with martial arts has been a rocky one			1
like many genres , kung fu has drifted in and out of fashion , but it has never regained the same popularity as its glorious heyday in the early 1970s			1
there 's nothing funny about either @entity14 or @entity15			2
and they 've got the fists to prove it			2
after breaking into the @entity20 and @entity21 with tv hardmen like @entity23 and @entity24 duffing up the occasional bad guy , the revolution really kicked in at the cinema			2
when @entity14 -- who had already made waves in @entity20 as the @entity24 's karate chopping sidekick , @entity29 -- appeared in the @entity32 - made " @entity31 , " or " @entity31 , " he established himself as the genre 's poster boy			1
@entity14 found initial success in his native @entity32 , but with his next movies , " @entity38 long guo jiang " ( " @entity40 " ) , which pitted him against @entity20 karate champion @entity15 , and the classic " @entity39 , " he became an international star			1
the plots of his films all followed a set structure : our gifted hero pursues a path of revenge or tough justice , accompanied by a stiff dose of morality			2
in this way his characters became representatives and protectors of the less powerful who have been unjustly treated			2
at the same time , the @entity20 tv show " @entity59 , " which started in 1972 , raised the profile of martial arts , and , through the lead character @entity62 , built an image of the patient , wise man , who uses his skills in combat as a last resort when reasoning fails , and again , is motivated entirely by his unshakeable morals			2
the reluctant hero is n't a new concept : he 's shared by the @entity73 and @entity74			1
the lone gunman in a western , too , tends to be loath to kill , and acts as the moral enforcer in a lawless place			2
but while the gunman in an isolated western town still commands the same respect from movie audiences as he lays down the law , our wise eastern mystic has almost entirely disappeared from @entity86			0
the biggest martial arts stars today -- with the notable exception of @entity89 , who continues to take on a mix of serious art movies in @entity32 and gang - war films set on the streets of urban @entity20 -- are either laughed at or laughed with by western audiences			1
kung fu superstar @entity96 has the impressive reputation of being almost indestructible			1
he does his own stunts and puts himself in some incredibly dangerous situations			0
but @entity96 is essentially a comedian			0
his stunts are used , in a very similar way to @entity96 's cinematic hero @entity102 , to amaze and amuse an audience			0
we are shocked that someone could do the things he does , hanging off moving buses with a walking stick , leaping across buildings			0
he is almost superhuman , but it 's done mainly for laughs			0
the other major kung fu stars have become figures of mockery			1
the @entity115 was awash with @entity15 gags pointing out just how strong he is ( " @entity15 does not sleep			0
" ) while @entity118 has done himself no favors by appearing in some of the worst films ever made			0
@entity86 does n't take them seriously -- and nor do we			0
directors have also mocked the 70s obsession with kung fu that gripped the western world , with heroes from films such as " @entity129 , " " @entity130 " and " @entity131 " fighting with cod seriousness while displaying laughable skills			1
so what has changed ? kung fu is not inherently funny			1
no matter how many times you watch " @entity39 , " it never ceases to be awe - inspiring			0
perhaps the answer is simple : we @entity86 film junkies have grown cynical			0
there is no room in our modern world for an unexplained , almost supernatural power against pointlessly evil adversaries			0
have we have lost our ability to suspend our disbelief ? so what can a real fan do ? are we condemned to trawling the movies of the 1970s in order to get our kung fu hit , harking back to a time when @entity15 really was feared and respected everywhere he went ? the answer is no. while @entity86 seems to have dumped its one - time darling , kung fu is alive and flourishing in @entity157 , where it all started			1
@entity89 puts out some great offerings in @entity32 , and there is a rising star in the form of @entity163 , a @entity164 actor with amazing technical skill , whose films like " @entity167 " have wowed audiences across the world			0
while @entity86 misses a trick and spends all its time laughing at its most skillful martial artists , the industry in @entity157 is doing what it has always done : bringing us all the high kicks , karate chops and spinning nunchucks we could ever want			1

kung fu has never regained its 1970s popularity in the @entity74
the genre has been mocked in movies like " @entity130 , " " @entity131 and @entity131 "
but fans know the genre is alive and flourishing in @entity157
