-- @entity2 death row inmate @entity1 was executed thursday using a drug commonly used to euthanize animals because of a nationwide shortage of the sedative normally employed in @entity2 's lethal injections			1
@entity8 is an anesthetizing drug widely used to euthanize dogs , cats and other animals			1
duty , who was pronounced dead at 6:18 p.m. ct , is believed to be the first condemned inmate to be executed using pentobarbital as part of the three - drug cocktail			1
lawyers for @entity13 , who was sentenced to die for strangling his cellmate with a shoelace , claimed that pentobarbital is risky and unproven in humans			1
the 10th @entity23 allowed @entity13 's execution to go forward using pentobarbital in place of sodium thiopental , a short - acting barbiturate that induces unconsciousness			1
" according to the record , sodium thiopental is now effectively unobtainable anywhere in the @entity34 , thus requiring @entity2 and other death - penalty states to revise their lethal injection protocols , " the court said in an order issued december 14			2
@entity39 , the @entity40 - based drug company that is the only domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped producing the drug in august 2009 because of a shortage of raw materials , a company spokesman said			1
the sedative is the first drug in @entity2 's lethal injection protocol			1
it is followed by vecuronium bromide , a drug that causes paralysis and stops breathing			1
the third drug , potassium chloride , stops the heart			1
@entity39 does not support the use of sodium thiopental in executions , a stance it has made known for years			0
" @entity39 manufactures this product because it improves or saves lives , and the company markets it solely for use as indicated on the product labeling			0
the drug is not indicated for capital punishment , and @entity39 does not support its use in this procedure , " spokesman @entity64 said in an e-mail			1
" in the spring of 2010 , @entity39 communicated with departments of corrections in the @entity34 to advise them of our position			0
we have done this every several years going back to the days when the company was part of @entity78			1
" the condemned man 's lawyers argued that pentobarbital 's effectiveness is not proven and said the @entity83 has not approved its use			2
a spokesman for the @entity83 did not immediately respond to an inquiry regarding pentobarbital 's status			2
a search on @entity90 , which lists all drugs approved by the @entity83 , showed its marketing status as discontinued , which means the drug is no longer being manufactured by the marketer			2
the decision to use pentobarbital in place of sodium thiopental sparked an outcry from death penalty opponents over its questionable effectiveness			2
" it 's controversial because no one knows how it 's going to work			0
it 's never been used in executions , " said @entity106 , executive director of the anti-capital punishment group , the @entity107			0
" it 's been used on animals and humans in an anesthetic way , not a killing way			2
if it does n't work in that context , we know that the other two drugs are extremely painful , so it 's going to be an excruciating process , " he said			0
@entity13 was sentenced to die in 2002 after pleading guilty ( against the advice of his lawyers ) to premeditated murder for strangling his 22 - year - old cellmate , @entity126 , with shoelaces			0
at the time , he was serving three life sentences for rape , robbery and shooting with intent to kill from a 1978 conviction			0
in a letter to the district attorney and in hearings , @entity13 said he killed his cellmate in the hopes of obtaining a death sentence			0
the state sought the death penalty based on several factors , including the heinous nature of the crime and the fact @entity13 carried it out while in prison			0
in post-conviction proceedings , however , @entity13 said he was depressed when he pled guilty and that his depression contributed to the murder and his decision to plead guilty			0
he also unsuccessfully pursued claims of ineffective counsel			0
the 10th @entity23 sided with a district court 's finding that another @entity2 death row inmate failed to show " that the use of pentobarbital in @entity2 's lethal injection protocol presents a constitutionally unacceptable risk of harm to the inmate , " according to its december 14 order			1
the appeals court cited the lower court 's findings that , based on testimony from an anesthesiologist , the 5,000 - milligram dosage ( 2,500 milligrams in each arm ) would give rise to a " virtually nil likelihood " that the inmates would feel the effects of the next two drugs .			0
