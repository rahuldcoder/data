wednesday 's cease - fire between @entity25 and @entity27 has provided some comfort , until the smoke clears and the wreckage can be assessed in @entity1 , @entity2 said			1
" a cease - fire may bring a little bit of relief , but when the cease - fire is done , they return to the status quo -- minus their homes , " @entity2 said			1

" how @entity53 @entity52 view the conflict arab - americans , @entity55 and the @entity18 diaspora are focusing renewed energy and concern on @entity1 , a sliver of land along the @entity62 coast that is about twice the size of @entity4 and is populated by 1.6 million people , including 1.1 @entity18 refugees			1
" @entity68 is a central issue for most @entity70 , " said @entity66 , spokeswoman for the @entity67			0
" overall , @entity71 - @entity53 want to see an end to the siege on @entity1			1
until that happens and until the @entity18 are able to exercise their basic human rights , we ca n't expect to see a lasting cease - fire or peace , " @entity66 said			1

the @entity91 is also part of the historical conflict between @entity25 and @entity18			2
" the occupation of both the @entity91 and @entity1 and the blockade against @entity1 -- as long as that is a reality , you 're going to see tensions between @entity18 and @entity25 , " @entity66 said			1
" you have civilians against the fourth strongest military in the world			0
it 's not military against military			0
" @entity2 owns an event management business that operates fund - raisers for @entity68			0
he 's also a comedian who does stand - up in @entity107 and @entity108			2

timeline of the conflict " what do you say about a place that has been occupied for more than 50 years , " @entity2 said			0
" this is a situation where people were born in occupation and lived their entire lives in occupation and died in occupation			0
it 's crazy to me			0
" if you cage an animal long enough , eventually when you get close to that cage , they 're going to hiss at you and they may even scratch , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 's family received a phone call tuesday from relatives in @entity137 , @entity1			2
" they were literally telling my mother how glass shakes			0
they do n't know what tomorrow brings or what the next hour brings , " @entity2 said			0
those perils are difficult for @entity2 to imagine			0
it 's hard on him , too			0
" it 's fear of going to sleep and getting a phone call or , worse , not getting any phone call and wondering -- having the feeling of whether no news is good news or not , " @entity2 said			0
" our issues are so small in comparison to what they 're going to go through			0
we may not be able to sleep because of a cricket in the room , but they are trying to sleep through the soundtrack of blasts and missiles			0
