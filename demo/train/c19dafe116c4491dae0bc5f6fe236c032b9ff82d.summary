@entity0 -- we 've turned the rich into caricatures			1
they 're greedy " fat cats " with cigars dangling from their snarled lips			2
" how dare the president call us fat ! we 're just big - boned , " says a decidedly obese cat in a 2011 political cartoon by @entity11			1
" it hurts my feelings deeply , " another fat cat says			2
other cartoons show them holding moneybags marked " $			2
" you know , just so it 's obvious			0
it 's easy to mock the wealthy -- especially the ultra- super-rich , whose incomes have weathered the recession better than anyone else 's , and who are taking home a chunk of the total economic pie that is obscene and unfair			1
watch documentaries like " @entity30 , " by @entity32 heir @entity31 , and it 's impossible not to laugh , or vomit , as you see how detached many 1 - percenters are from reality			1
one brags about her " really fun " family helicopter			0
" i do n't remember the evening all that clearly , but i 've definitely spent several thousand dollars on a bar bill , probably , " a gambling heir says , referring to a night of drinking in the @entity42 , outside @entity0			0
this is all in good fun , but on the two - year anniversary of the @entity51 movement , which failed to achieve its goals of promoting economic policies that would shrink the rich - poor gap , it 's worth asking ourselves : is it fair to paint the super-rich as a homogenous set of villains ? or , more to the point : is it productive ? last week , i put that question to former @entity65 labor secretary @entity64 , who is ( and has been ) one of the country 's foremost advocates for narrowing the gulf that has emerged between rich and poor			1
his new documentary , " @entity70 , " is to economic justice what @entity75 's " @entity74 " was to global climate change : it 's a powerful , if slightly wonky , outline of the problem , complete with charts , @entity81 - type presentations and a spirited call to action			1
other recent films on @entity65 's wealth gap , " @entity86 , " for instance , hold no punches in the way their efforts paint the wealthy as detached jerks who are buying off politicians to support their needless and greedy habits			0
but @entity64 does n't want to make villains out of the wealthy			1
" i think that 's wrongheaded and it does n't lead to any constructive solutions , " he told me in an interview with a few reporters in @entity0			0
his film aims to show how economic inequality hurts everyone			1
" the rich would be better off with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy , " he told me , " than they ( are ) now with a large share of an economy that is anemic -- that is basically not growing at all , largely because you do n't have many people with much money to be able to sustain the economy and buy enough			1
" " i think the rich would do better with a society that was less polarized , " he added , " with an economy that 's less polarized and more collaborative , than they do now with a society that is very ( much ) at loggerheads			2
" the trouble is convincing them of that			0
@entity64 's film might be a start			0
one rich person it features is @entity126 , a venture capitalist from @entity127 who sold a company to @entity129 in 2007 for $ 6.4 billion and was " the first nonfamily investor " in @entity131 , which , you know , is worth big bucks			2
but , unlike many money - mover types , @entity126 supports policies that economists say would help narrow the rich - poor gap and increase economic mobility			1
he says it 's in his interest			0
in the doc , @entity126 talks about how he has tons of money to spend , and he does buy nice things , but he does n't spend that much more than a middle - class person			2
" i have the nicest @entity146 you can get , " he says , " but it 's still only one @entity146			0
" if dozens of middle - class people had his money , they 'd buy dozens of cars , and dozens of everything , which would create more industry and more jobs			2
his businesses would have more customers			0
the economy overall would grow			0
@entity64 calls this the " virtuous cycle			0
" right now , we 're stuck in a pattern he says is " vicious " -- where cash is ending up only in the hands of a few , and money is slipping through the fingers of those who would actually need it , and who actually would spend it in the economy			0
to reverse course , it would help to have the support of the rich -- those greedy fat cats we all love to hate			2
to convince them , though , maybe that means we need to stop thinking of them as villains -- and , instead , challenge them to be heroes			1
the wounds of the financial crisis are still fresh , five years out			0
but this anniversary should give us pause			1
we 've turned both the very rich and the very poor into villains			1
now the task is to think about how we can patch up and move forward			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity188 .			1

*tuesday* is the two - year anniversary of @entity51
@entity192 : the date should give us pause about how we *characterize* the rich
he says the rich should be allies in the *battle* against economic inequality
@entity188 : instead of making the rich villains , we should *persuade* them to be heroes
