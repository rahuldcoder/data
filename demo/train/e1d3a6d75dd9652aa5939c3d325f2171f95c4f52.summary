@entity0 -- for @entity3 , it should have been a dream : a crush of excited people swarming his booth at the @entity8 , where his startup is launching its first product			1
but all the people hoisting cameras and raising themselves on tiptoe for a better view wednesday afternoon were n't there to see his robot			2
they were angling for a peek at pop star @entity19 , who was making an appearance at the booth next door			1
" we 're pretty much shut down , " said @entity3 with a weary look of resignation , as rubberneckers squealed and shouted " @entity19 ! " in the background			1
" we ca n't run our demos			0
" @entity3 's fledgling company , @entity28 , is making its first appearance at @entity8 to introduce its @entity30 , a hockey - puck - shaped robotic device that zips around on little wheels , controlled by an @entity33 or @entity34			1
owners can download apps to their phone that give the robot specific behaviors , like avoiding obstacles			2
the gadget will go on sale this spring at the quirky price of $ 111.11			0
but none of the hundreds of people pressed up against his booth cared about that			0
they only had eyes for the teen singer with the sideswept hair who was greeting fans nearby at the @entity56 booth , where he made an appearance on behalf of that company 's new @entity59 , a portable speaker that morphs , " transformers " style , into a little dancing robot			1
middle - aged tech execs are n't exactly @entity19 's demographic , but many onlookers said they were there to get photos or autographs for their teen - age kids			1
some people even asked if they could climb atop @entity74 's plywood demo table to get a better view			0
( the answer was no. ) " it 's the best of times , it 's the worst of times , " grumbled @entity78 's business partner , @entity28 co-founder @entity77 , surveying the madness surrounding him			1
" we 're trying to get him ( @entity19 ) to defect			2
" @entity3 said he was planning to approach @entity8 officials about compensating him for his lost booth time during @entity19 's two - hour appearance			1
" it 's definitely costing us valuable hours of time with our target audience , " @entity77 said			0
in the meantime , however , @entity3 had another plan : if he could n't beat them , he was going to join them			0
he placed one of his robots on the floor and , using his iphone , began navigating it toward @entity19 in the hopes of getting a remote - controlled picture			2
" i was driving it up to the @entity104 , " he said with a grin a few minutes later			0
" i made it about halfway there			0
but the security guard grabbed it			0

*entrepreneurs* had *misfortune* of a @entity8 booth next to where @entity19 was appearing
rubberneckers *overwhelmed* their @entity117 booth , but not to see their robot
startup co-founder : " it 's the best of times , it 's the worst of times "
