@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 is richer than it was before @entity3 struck in 2005 , but largely because many of its poor have not returned since the storm , according to a report released wednesday			1
average wages are up , " knowledge - based " jobs are gaining ground on the area 's traditional blue - collar economy and basic services like schools and hospitals are improving , @entity0 mayor @entity7 told reporters			1
" but there are also some sobering and thoughtful statistics about how far we have to go , " he said			0
while the poverty rate of 23 percent is the lowest since 1979 , that 's nearly double the national average of 13 percent , according to figures from the @entity25 @entity24 and the @entity26			1
and many of the city 's poor residents have either moved to the suburbs or have n't returned to the area , the report 's authors said			1
" it 's the dispersion of the impoverished population in general and the struggles that folks have had to return is probably the main factor , " said @entity34 , of the @entity24			2
and while the number of poor people in the city has fallen by about half , to about 68,000 , the number of poor people living in the six suburban parishes is up , to about 93,000 , @entity34 said			0
since the storm , the metro area 's population has rebounded to about 90 percent of the 1.3 million who lived there before the hurricane , according to wednesday 's report			1
the central city 's population of about 355,000 is about is 78 percent of the pre-storm figure , and it 's more middle - class and slightly less @entity57 and @entity58 than before , according to the report			1
the city 's non-white population remains a solid majority , but dropped from 72 percent in 2000 census figures to 69 percent currently , the report states			1
the non-white population grew slightly in the suburbs , from an estimated 43 percent in 2000 to 45 percent currently , according to the report			2
@entity3 killed more than 1,800 people on the @entity67 when it struck near the @entity1 - @entity69 state line on august 29 , 2005			2
most of the dead were in and around @entity0 , where more than three - quarters of the city flooded after its protective levees failed			1
nearly 300,000 people were displaced , and the disaster turned a harsh light on a city that had seen its traditional economy -- based on oil , shipbuilding and tourism -- shrivel since the 1980s			2
as a result , more of the area 's economy is based on white - collar fields like higher education , legal services and education , the report found			1
@entity7 said those fields and innovative new industries are where the region 's future lies			1
" relying on raw materials is important , " he said			0
" but what you do with them and how you transform them by adding value to them is where our future economic success is going to be , as opposed to just extracting raw material			0
there is a better way , there is a higher way , and it 's all for the most part based on knowledge			2
" housing costs , which went up sharply when the storm destroyed so much of the city , are still high			0
nearly 60 percent of city households and 45 percent of those in the suburbs pay more than 35 percent of their income for shelter , @entity34 said			0
but in part because of the reconstruction effort , @entity0 was sheltered from the worst of the recession that began in late 2007 , the report states			0
and researchers found the people who live there are more engaged in civic life than before , and have demanded reforms of institutions once considered hopelessly broken or corrupt			0
" in general , higher numbers of @entity131 are participating in public meetings and processes and are now more likely than residents of other cities to attend public meetings where city affairs are discussed , " the report states			0
residents " have demanded and pursued systemic changes in key community and government institutions that were failing to deliver optimal results for citizens and taxpayers , " such as health care , schools and the courts , it concluded .			0

report examines @entity0 five years after @entity3
wages up , poverty down , but many poor did n't return
mayor says a " knowledge - based " economy is the city 's future
metro population is 90 percent of pre-storm figure ; city at 78 percent
