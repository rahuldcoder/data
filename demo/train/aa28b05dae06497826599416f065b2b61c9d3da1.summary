-- the folks in @entity2 are quite used to bad weather , but tuesday night they were enduring a brutal trifecta of inclement conditions : unusually cold temperatures , high winds and almost another foot of snow			1
it was so bad the @entity13 @entity12 team did something they have n't done since 2000 : they told their fans to stay home and postponed their game at the @entity19			2
a blizzard warning is in effect for three counties until 6 a.m. , forecasters said , and @entity0 affiliate @entity24 reported one wind gust of 51 mph			2
there were also flood warnings in some areas because of broken water mains			1
during an afternoon news conference , @entity31 officials told residents to stay off the roads and said there was a significant number of road closures			1
officials said it would be wednesday afternoon at the earliest before most roads would be cleared			1
but in a small bit of good news , part of @entity43 was frozen over , meaning the lake - effect snow system pulled less moisture and snowfall amounts were significantly lower than first feared			1
still , one area of @entity2 had 14 inches of new snow tuesday , @entity24 said			1
the @entity13 said their game against the @entity50 would be played at a date yet to be determined			2
across the nation , many cities were still dealing with the effects of a polar vortex that dropped lower than normal and brought below - freezing temperatures to many states , including @entity58			2
and , unfortunately , the cold weather was also being blamed for one new death from hypothermia , authorities said tuesday			1
@entity63 saw a record low for the date			2
it was just four degrees in @entity68 , breaking a record of six set in 1896			2
that 's not quite as bad as the all - time low of 15 below zero in 1934			1
but with the wind chill , temperatures still felt well below zero -- a 69 - degree drop from monday , when the weather was a relatively sultry 50 degrees with wind chill			2
temperatures plummeted below freezing somewhere in all 50 states tuesday morning -- most , but not all , due to the arctic blast hovering like an ice chest , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity81			1
( the cold regions of @entity84 and @entity85 , for example , had nothing to do with the vortex			2
) in @entity58 , despite the low temperatures , crops were not damaged , the state 's @entity88 told @entity0			1
authorities have blamed at least 16 deaths on the cold so far , including 11 from traffic accidents and three involving hypothermia			1

and animals are suffering and dying , too			0

and at the @entity126 in @entity127 , bald eagles and @entity130 penguins , " who are used to temperate climates , " were taken off exhibit until the weather warms up , the facility reported			0

all three @entity114 - bound trains -- two coming from @entity84 , and one originating in @entity138 , @entity101 -- stopped monday afternoon or evening because conditions prevented them from going farther			1

" the passengers were sheltered in place overnight , " @entity132 said			0
" it was n't safe to take people off these trains ... because there was n't a good way to get people to and from the trains in the bad weather			0
" @entity133 worked to make other arrangements , putting some passengers on buses			0

" it certainly was n't as comfortable as anyone would have liked , but it was not unsafe , " @entity132 said			0
" it was the best thing to do in these temperatures in these conditions at that time overnight in that part of the state			0
" @entity169 , who boarded one of the @entity84 trains in @entity172 , praised the crew for helping to keep passengers positive , but said her trip -- which ended up taking more than a day from start to finish -- still was " one of the worst ( experiences ) ever			0
" " i ca n't feel my butt because it 's just not there anymore , just sitting for literally 26 hours , " @entity180 told @entity0 tuesday after arriving in @entity114 by bus			1
@entity180 and other passengers said the crew gave them a complimentary meal during the stranding			0
a fourth @entity133 train was stuck for nine hours monday night and early tuesday near @entity189 , @entity190 , about 300 passengers had to wait more than nine hours to reach their destination , @entity0 affiliate @entity193 reported			1
" it was kind of like purgatory , " a passenger told @entity0 affiliate @entity197 , adding that it was " not quite hellish because there was good company			0
" the train , which was bound for @entity114 , finally arrived at the city 's @entity201 on monday night , @entity197 reported			1

ships ran into trouble as well			0

it was 15 below zero @entity230 ( minus @entity231 )			0
@entity232 cancels @entity234 flights to rest crews " this is the wettest snow i 've ever touched , the easiest snow to make a snowman and to have snowball fights , " @entity224 wrote in a @entity0 @entity237 discussion			1
" it 's also probably the worst ( weather ) i 've ever been in because of the temperature			1
" " sick as a dog			0
space heater died yesterday , " @entity247 of @entity248 , @entity111 , said on @entity237			2

" in @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity253 posted that she still had to go to work			0
" so , it 's layers of clothing , the hubby 's big woolly scarf , and a lot of coffee			2
" @entity264 in @entity127 can relate			0
" i have about three layers on , two gloves , two ( pairs of ) socks , scarf and ski goggles , " he wrote on @entity237			0
extreme wind chills mean flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes			0
several major school districts are closed tuesday , including those in @entity275 and @entity276 , to prevent children from waiting outside at bus stops			2
when will this end ? temperatures should start edging higher on wednesday			0
by thursday , most of the country will be back to normal , @entity0 meteorologist @entity280 said			0
in fact , some temperatures may even be a bit higher than usual			0
