-- at a time when the trend among state legislatures is to create tough immigration laws , one @entity2 city is pinning its ambitions on an opposite track			1
@entity9 , with a population of about 140,000 , wants to become the friendliest place for immigrants			1
immigrants , officials say , have opened businesses and created jobs in the city 's economy , and they hope to reverse the region 's economic slowdown by betting on immigrants			1
the @entity21 this week accepted the so - called " @entity22 " plan , a framework for policies that could be implemented to make the city a more welcoming place			1
the pro-immigrant sentiment in @entity22 stands in contrast to a number of high profile laws at the state level targeting illegal immigrants , but it is not a perfect comparison			1
the state laws are focused on combating illegal immigration			1
the city plan has nothing to do with illegal immigration , officials say , but rather with welcoming immigrants and treating all residents with respect			1
" critics conveniently connect the word ' immigrant ' with the word ' illegal ' when talking about the welcome @entity22 plan , but that 's not what this initiative is all about , " city manager @entity44 said in a news release			1
" we have many good people from all nationalities coming here to invest in the community and to build a better life			0
" but at least a couple of the recommendations made in the welcome @entity22 plan appear to take undocumented immigrants into consideration			2
the plan suggests the creation of a municipal identification card for @entity22 residents who do n't have any other form of @entity68			0
such a card could presumably help undocumented residents who need identification to open bank accounts or apply for driver 's licenses and other services			0
another item that could have an impact on those who are in the country illegally is a recommendation that police emphasize immigration status checks only for suspects of serious crimes			2
such a policy could protect undocumented immigrants stopped for minor offenses from fearing deportation			2
it is an opposite approach from those states with laws that seek to have police check the immigration status of everyone they stop			1
other @entity22 recommendations include improving the interpreter capabilities offered by the city and creating hiring incentives for government employees to learn a foreign language			2
the welcome @entity22 plan also advocates seeking federal grants for @entity104 study for immigrants			2
it also recommends using city lobbyists to advocate for pro-immigrant laws at the state and federal level			1
many of these proposals would be controversial at the federal level , but opposition appeared to be minor in @entity22			0
at the public hearing where the plan was discussed , 10 members of the public stood up to address the commissioners about it			0
nine of the 10 spoke in support of the measure , and the lone dissenter was n't from @entity22 , but from nearby @entity124			0
the plan was approved unanimously			0
@entity22 mayor @entity126 declined to speak to @entity0 saturday , and referred to a statement posted on his blog , which he read at the commission meeting			0
" this plan is designed to enhance the potential of @entity22 as a competitor in the global economy by attracting immigrants who bring new ideas , new perspective , and new talent to our work force , " @entity126 said in the statement			0
" in order to reverse the decades - long trend of economic decline in this city , we need to think globally and recruit the very best from around the world			1
" welcome @entity22 was hatched from a study of housing conditions for @entity150 residents , which ultimately led to a multiagency , communitywide effort to draft the plan			0
when the city asked its residents about the impact of immigrants , they learned that businesses had been started by immigrants			1
houses were rehabilitated and underused buildings were reused and rejuvenated , the report found			0
according to the city , immigrants are two times more likely than others to become entrepreneurs			2
" history proves that closed minds and resistance to change only results in failure , " @entity126 said			0
" to those citizens who are against the welcome @entity22 plan â € ” instead of condemning something that you did n't participate in , volunteer to help us make it better			0

@entity9 wants to become a nationally recognized immigrant - friendly city
the initiative comes at a time when states are passing tough immigration laws
immigrants are more likely to start businesses and create jobs , the city says
