meet @entity0 -- a shy pangolin who recently was released into a national park in @entity4 after being seized from the illegal pangolin trade			1
pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world , which made them the subject of a recent series for @entity12 's @entity14 project			1
they 're traded by the ton			1
the fine people who are taking care of @entity0 -- from the @entity19 and @entity20 -- agreed to let @entity12 's readers do something kind of cool : we 're going to vote on a new name for this little guy , and then follow his journey			1
i asked readers to submit some name ideas			0
the top five you suggested were : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			0
update : @entity40 closed on tuesday at 6 p.m. et. @entity0 will take on whichever name readers select			1
some of the names require a little explanation			0
@entity34 is @entity44 for " shy , " which fits since researchers at the @entity19 and @entity20 tell me @entity0 is one of the shyest of all the introverted pangolins they 've encountered			1
@entity52 is @entity4 for " protection , " which is nice because pangolins sure need it			0
@entity36 is alliterative and kinda fun in an old - timey way			2
( pangolins have been called little dinosaurs , after all ; i picture @entity36 the @entity20 wearing a monocle and a top hat			2
) @entity37 is my least favorite of the bunch , but it 's a @entity64 character that does bear a striking resemblance			2
and @entity38 , according to the commenter who suggested that , is short for " @entity68 , " " because his body looks like a suit of armor and he 's valiantly fighting to survive			2
" so there you go -- five names , five stories			0
you can read up on @entity0 on this blog from the @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity0 is so terribly shy that when researchers released him he just sat there in a box for hours , unsure of where to go or what to do			1
he burrowed beneath one tree , then another , with researchers following his moves with a radio - tracking device attached to his tail ( you can see it in the image above )			2
at one point , he moved so little that it sounds like the researchers -- or at least some blog readers -- doubted that he was alive			0
" for any of you still not convinced he is alive this morning , with my head stuck right into a tree hollow , i saw the element of the transmitter , " wrote @entity96 , one of the researchers , on march 29			0
" i tried to give it a little pull to see if it was attached to a body or not ( we could n't actually see him )			0
however , before i had the chance the element started moving of its own accord and we heard some movement			0
" the transmitter is certainly still attached to @entity0 and @entity0 is still alive ! " alive and in need of a better name			1
but that 's where you come in .			0

vote below to *rename* this pangolin , who is currently called @entity0
@entity122 says @entity0 is no name for such an *interesting* *animal*
the pangolin is a *scale* - covered mammal that 's illegally trafficked by the ton
it 's thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world
