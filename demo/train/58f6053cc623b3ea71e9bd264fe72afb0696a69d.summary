-- hop into this @entity1 , and without any extensive training you can be on your way to exploring the deep blue sea in no time			1
why is this called a semi-submarine ? the entire boat is not submerged , but it 's more like a pontoon boat with a transparent waterproof compartment hanging from its middle			2
that means @entity14 is not going to be using one of these subs for that deep - water shoot for his @entity19 sequel , but it 's still suitable for giving you an eye - popping view of the undersea world			1

photos : @entity28 's @entity1 the little boat cruises along at a leisurely sightseeing pace that 's unspecified by its maker , which will only say that its batteries will last eight hours at cruising speed or four hours at top speed			1
it 's built by @entity37 company @entity36 , which plans to sell fleets of these @entity39 to resorts , and single units to individuals and yacht owners			2
the company offers to build custom moorings for the craft , as well as hoists for yachts			1

just think , even people who ca n't swim can enjoy the spectacular view			0
