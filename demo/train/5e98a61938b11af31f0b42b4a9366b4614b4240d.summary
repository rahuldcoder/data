-- ten years ago , the number of @entity3 visitors to @entity4 was well below a thousand a year , with @entity5 permitted by @entity6 to visit only during the summer @entity7			1
the number of @entity3 visitors has since risen to 5,000 to 6,000 a year , and @entity5 , who now make up 25 % of @entity3 visitors , are allowed to enter year round			0
in response to the surge of interest , @entity13 - based website @entity11 has recently launched a comprehensive @entity4 app. part travel guide , part travel booking advisory , it features more than 350 places of interest			1
all destinations on the @entity24 are open to visitors and have been geo - tagged by @entity26 , a @entity4 satellite imagery expert who the company says was banned from the country after widespread news coverage of his work			1
the app includes sections detailing the country 's history , culture and the ethics of traveling to @entity4 , as well as a @entity40 section offering insights by @entity43 manager @entity42 , who has been leading groups into the country for more than 10 years			1
" the app appeals to that curiosity a lot of people have about what on @entity52 it 's like to go to a country like @entity4 and is designed for armchair travelers as well as people who are actively interested in visiting , " says project manager @entity45			1
a longtime @entity4 watcher and founder and managing editor of @entity59 , @entity45 got involved with the project last year when friends set up @entity11 , a site dedicated to easing travel to countries with difficult relationships with @entity3 governments			1
the @entity4 app , developed by @entity68 , is the first to launch			2
guides to @entity70 and @entity71 are expected to follow			0
what can tourists expect when visiting @entity4 ? more than just monuments " users can compare prices through the app in a similar way to @entity79 or they can use the unique platform to put together their own itinerary and get companies to compete against each other for a custom ( trip ) , " says @entity45			2
he 's most excited about the work done by @entity26 , who 's been studying @entity88 images for more than five years to piece together a detailed map of @entity4			2
" people think you can only go to @entity6 and see a bunch of monuments , but that 's not the case , " says @entity45			0
" it 's interesting that they are opening places like @entity99 , which is near a prison camp			0
" with the increase in new destinations , it increases the chance that people will see more of the real @entity4			2
" the 99 - cent app has an offline mode so it can be used in @entity4 , where internet connectivity is difficult and expensive			1
though tourists were once forced to hand over their mobile phones for storage when entering the country , widespread reports in early 2013 noted that government officials appear to have relaxed the rules			0
for @entity45 , the app is strictly for armchair use -- he too is banned from @entity4 , most likely for his work with @entity59 , a " privately owned specialist site focused on @entity4			1
" based in @entity13 , @entity45 founded @entity59 in 2010			0
the greatest interest for the app is expected to come from the @entity5 -- which is why it 's been produced in @entity123			0
if successful , the app may be translated into @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity4 , the other markets with strong interest in @entity4			2
the project , which started as an idea over a drink in a pub and was n't expected to cost much money or time , has wound up taking much longer and costing far more than expected , says @entity45 , noting that the group has spent $ 20,000 to develop the engine , along with hundreds of hours of writing and editing			1
" we just hope a nuclear test -- which is looking increasingly possible at the moment -- does n't happen to eclipse the launch , " he says			0
the @entity142 is now available on @entity143 and @entity145 stores			0
@entity45 says the app 's main competition is @entity148 , a travel guidebook publishing company that covers non-mainstream destinations such as @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity70			0
