@entity0 -- jurors deciding if a concert promoter is liable in @entity5 's death will return for a fourth day of deliberations wednesday			1
the panel of 12 worked nearly 11 hours since closing arguments thursday without reaching a verdict , a fact that might offer encouragement to the lawyers for @entity5 's mother and three children			1
a " no " decision on the first of 16 questions on their verdict form -- did @entity19 hire dr. @entity20 -- would have immediately ended the trial without a need to consider the remaining 15 questions that concern negligence and damages			1
if they 've already completed work on the first question in nearly 11 hours of deliberations , it would represent a major hurdle for the @entity33 ' case in the five - month - long wrongful death trial			1
@entity35 and her grandchildren @entity37 , @entity38 and blanket contend @entity19 is responsible for the pop icon 's death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted in his death			2
@entity5 died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol , which dr. @entity20 told investigators he was using to treat the singer 's insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals			1
@entity20 is set to be released from jail later this month after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter			2
the death happened just days before @entity5 's comeback tour -- promoted and produced by @entity19 -- was set to debut in @entity54 in the summer of 2009			1
question no. 1 did @entity19 hire @entity20 ? the company 's lawyers contend @entity5 chose @entity20 , who had treated him for three years as a family physician , but @entity5 lawyers argue the promoters chose to negotiate their own contract with the doctor so they could control him			1
a so - called " smoking gun " e-mail sent by @entity19 co-ceo @entity63 11 days before @entity5 died said , " we want to remind ( @entity20 ) that it is @entity19 , not @entity5 , who is paying his salary			1
we want to remind him what is expected of him			0
" the @entity33 also point to a television interview soon after @entity5 died in which @entity19 ceo @entity19 said @entity19 " hired " @entity20			1
if jurors say yes to the hiring question , deliberations then turn to the questions of negligence			2
were @entity19 executives negligent in dealing with @entity20 and did their negligence contribute significantly to @entity5 's death ? @entity19 lawyers argue they had no way of knowing that @entity20 -- licensed to practice in four states and never sued for malpractice -- was a risk to @entity5			1
the singer was a secretive drug addict who kept even his closest relatives in the dark about his use of propofol to sleep , they contend			0
@entity5 lawyers contend the company 's agreement with @entity20 created a medical conflict of interest that led him to break his @entity94 to do no harm			2
@entity20 , who was $ 1 million in debt , was pressured to deliver the risky treatments or else possibly lose the $ 150,000 monthly salary , they argue			2
executives ignored a series of warning signs that @entity5 was at risk in his last weeks , including deteriorating health that included weight loss , inability to perform his trademark dances or remember lyrics to his standard songs , and paranoia , the @entity33 argue			2
a sleep expert testified that the nightly propofol infusions robbed @entity5 of vital @entity113 sleep , which caused the deterioration			0
blame and damages if jurors reach a decision that @entity19 is liable , then they 'll consider other questions to determine how much in damages the promoter must pay @entity35 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity122			2
@entity5 lead lawyer @entity123 suggested a range between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion to replace the earnings lost by @entity5 's death at age 50 and the non-economic -- or personal -- damages from the loss of a father and son			0
the damage award , however , would be reduced by the percentage of blame jurors decide @entity5 shares in his death			0
the @entity5 lawyer suggested in closing arguments thursday that they assigned 20 % of the liability to @entity5			0
engaged jurors jurors appeared engaged and entertained through 21 weeks of the trial , which included dramatic testimony by @entity5 's mother , son and former wife			0
several jurors even applauded at the end of testimony by famed choreographer - director @entity152			0
their first notes to the judge friday indicated that juror no. 6 had been chosen as presiding juror -- or foreman			0
he is a high school physical education teacher who heads to the football field after each day of court to coach a team			0
they also asked for 12 copies of the written contract @entity19 sent to @entity20 , a copy of the " @entity170 " film -- which documents @entity5 's last rehearsals -- and a dvd player			1
a @entity5 lawyer suggested outside of court that it would be a good sign for his side if deliberations last more than a few days -- since it indicates jurors have moved past the key initial questions			1
@entity1 's camera will be in the courtroom when a verdict is read			0
@entity183 judge @entity182 approved the network 's request last week to televise the closing arguments and verdict			0
she refused a request in april to allow cameras in court for the opening and testimony phase .			0

new : jurors deliberate nearly 11 hours over 3 days
the first question : did @entity19 hire dr. @entity20 ?
*lengthy* deliberations would *benefit* the @entity33 , a lawyer suggests
a verdict would be televised
