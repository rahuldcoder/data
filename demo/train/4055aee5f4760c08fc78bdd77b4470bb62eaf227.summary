better yet , sit on it			2
@entity2 is back doing what he 's supposed to be doing in " @entity4 , " a sentimental baseball saga that is the inverse of " @entity6 " in almost every respect and shows the star 's still got what it takes to carry a movie home			1
film stars are n't always the best judge of when it to call it a day , and you might fear the worst as @entity2 grouses about his pee in the first scene			1
surely this is n't the curve he 's troubled about ? but of course that 's wrong : @entity2 knows best			1
part of his longevity as a star comes from his readiness to probe his own weaknesses , and it should come as no surprise that he 's candid -- and funny -- about the frailties of old age			2
his character , @entity33 , is a scout for the @entity34 , one of the best there ever was			1
but has he still got what it takes ? not only is he computer illiterate , but the guy still reads newspapers			2
that 's not all : he 's losing his eyesight , and though he 's doing his best to hide it , it 's getting harder to explain the rapid accumulation of dinks and dents in his convertible			0
things come to a head the week before the draft			0
he 's sent to @entity55 to check out the next big slugger			0
his buddy @entity57 ( @entity58 ) begs @entity33 ' daughter , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , to cover his back			1
a hotshot lawyer on the verge of making partner , she 's got plenty of reasons to turn him down flat , including that her dad 's a cranky and uncommunicative curmudgeon and always has been			1
in her childhood , he dragged her round ball fields or packed her off to boarding school without ever thinking to ask her preference , and she 's been in therapy since college			0
you wo n't need 20/20 vision to see what 's coming next			0
although it 's directed by a proxy ( @entity81 was assistant director on " @entity82 , " " @entity83 " and " @entity84 " among others ) , " @entity4 " has all the hallmarks of an @entity2 movie in his folksiest mood			1
it 's conservative with a small " c " ; interested in people -- not style or systems -- it 's plain - spoken and heartfelt , a bit corny , a bit clich√©d and not at all slick or quick			0
with @entity2 , when the script is strong and everything comes together , he 's capable of producing wonderful movies			1
other times you have to take the rough with the smooth			0
what works here is , first and foremost , @entity104			0
it 's a peach of a role ( it hardly needs pointing out that @entity2 has a long history of putting himself up against strong , independent women ) , and @entity104 is charming as a smart , attractive , career - driven , pool shootin ' , baseball lovin ' , perpetually thwarted daddy 's girl			1
maybe she 's a shade too attractive -- it 's hard to take your eyes off her hair , so luscious it practically demands its own trailer -- but the contrast with flinty , brittle old @entity33 is effective , and @entity104 shows some grit too , easily bossing @entity122 ( game as the movie 's token love interest )			1
as for @entity2 , he could play his part with his eyes shut and still hit it out of the park			2
@entity131 's screenplay is on shakier ground when it tries to get father and daughter to open up to each other			2
not many filmmakers would risk the scenes where each separately break into " @entity138 , " and you will have to decide for yourself whether they belong on the cutting - room floor			0
but for all its occasional tin ear , " @entity147 " dialogue , its contrivances and shortcuts , this remains a fundamentally sound and solid entertainment with a deep - rooted conviction that how we treat each other matters .			0
