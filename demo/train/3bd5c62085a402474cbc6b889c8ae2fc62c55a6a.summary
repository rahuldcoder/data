-- @entity1 ca n't get no respect			2
in 2007 , @entity3 published an influential cover story proclaiming it " the most dangerous country in the world			0
" the bill of particulars for this indictment typically includes the inarguable facts that the @entity11 is headquartered in @entity1 , as is what remains of @entity13 , as well as an alphabet soup of other jihadist terrorist groups			1
and in 2011 , it became embarrassingly clear that @entity1 had harbored @entity17 for almost a decade , even if unwittingly , in a city not far from the capital , @entity20			2
leading @entity1 liberals are routinely assassinated by militants			2
two - time prime minister @entity23 was killed when she returned from exile in 2007			0
around three years later , the governor of @entity26 was shot to death by one of his own bodyguards because he had the temerity to suggest , correctly , that @entity1 's onerous blasphemy laws tend to penalize its tiny @entity33 minority			1
the governor 's assassin was feted as a hero by many @entity1			2
@entity1 scientists have proliferated nuclear technology to the rogue state of @entity40			2
and @entity1 now has the fastest - growing nuclear weapons program in the world			2
@entity1 is also routinely gripped by @entity44 violence , has a serious secessionist movement in the vast gas - rich province of @entity47 and its financial capital , @entity49 , is one of the world 's most dangerous cities			2
add to this toxic brew the fact that @entity1 operates like a tea party paradise ; only about 2 % of the population pays income taxes , as a result of which the government does n't do much of anything for anybody			0
lengthy power cuts are hollowing out @entity1 's already weak economy , which , at its present 3 % growth rate , can not possibly sustain @entity1 's youth bulge			1
but there is another side to @entity1 that suggests some underlying strengths that do n't make quite as good copy as the @entity11 marching towards @entity20 , as they did in 2009			1
those strengths are @entity1 's maturing institutions			1
@entity1 has a largely ineffectual state , but it has a vibrant civil society that picks up at least some of the government 's slack			1
the private @entity78 , for instance , runs a fleet of 1,800 ambulances and a slew of other welfare services for the poor across @entity1			0
as a result of this strong civil society , @entity1 had its version of the @entity87 long before the wave of demands for accountable governments emerged in the @entity91			1
it was , after all , a movement of thousands of lawyers taking to the streets protesting the sacking of the @entity97 chief justice by the military dictator @entity98 in 2007 that helped to dislodge @entity98 from power			0
@entity1 has a vibrant media			0
a decade ago , there was only @entity102 , which featured leaden government propaganda			0
now there are dozens of news channels : many of them conspiracist and anti-american , but many of them also anti-taliban and pro-democracy			0
in the past year , the @entity97 has taken on the @entity111 , @entity1 's powerful military intelligence agency , successfully demanding that the organization produce prisoners who had disappeared for years			1
in november , @entity1 agreed to a pact with long - time rival @entity115 granting @entity115 " most favored nation " trading status ; something that would have been unimaginable a few years back			1
this important development was sanctioned by @entity1 's powerful army , which is a significant player in the country 's economy and understands that one way out of @entity1 's economic mess is to hitch itself to @entity115 's much larger economy			1
even @entity129 - @entity1 relations -- which were at a nadir in 2011 because of a @entity132 contractor killing two @entity1 , the @entity17 raid and the death of some two dozen @entity1 soldiers during a @entity137 airstrike -- are gingerly improving			0
@entity1 has recently reopened the ground routes for @entity137 supplies to cross @entity1 into @entity140 , which were closed for months to protest the deaths of the @entity1 soldiers during the @entity137 airstrike			0
tellingly , @entity1 has never even threatened to close the crucial air corridor across @entity1 that allows @entity129 and @entity137 aircraft to fly into @entity140			0
one can get a sense of how important this air corridor is from the fact that @entity149 near the @entity1 border in southern @entity140 is reported to have the busiest runway in the world with some 700 flights landing or taking off there every day			0
the present government is the first civilian government in @entity1 history that is poised to complete its full term of office sometime this year or early next year -- depending on when the next election is called -- without being overturned by a military coup or dismissed in some back room deal			2
and the military , which has seized power four times in the past six and half decades , has shown no interest in doing so again for the foreseeable future			0
the lengthy debate in @entity1 's parliament that was completed in april about whether @entity1 should allow the @entity129 to use armed @entity132 drones on its territory is a welcome intrusion of @entity1 's civilian officials into the national security arena long monopolized by the military			1
the parliament called for the end of any @entity129 drone strikes			0
despite the visibility of the hardline religious parties on the streets of @entity1 , in the voting booth , these parties have recently fared very poorly			0
a coalition of @entity184 religious parties known as the @entity185 secured control of two of @entity1 's four provinces in an election in 2002 and 11 % of the votes to the @entity191			1
but the @entity185 garnered only a piddling 2 % of the vote in the 2008 election			0
and where @entity1 's national interests are at stake , the military is aggressive against the @entity11			1
as the @entity11 marched three years ago as close as 60 miles to @entity20 , the army launched major military operations in the northern region of @entity201 and the western area of @entity203 to end the @entity11 's control of these areas			1
@entity1 officials are swift to point out , correctly , that as a result , more @entity1 soldiers have died fighting the @entity11 than the servicemen of the @entity129 and other @entity137 countries combined			1
@entity1 has a myriad of well - known problems , but it also has some residual strengths that often get obscured by rhetoric about the " world 's most dangerous country			1
" @entity1 is no @entity40 , and if @entity1 really got a grip on their own problems , rather than too often resorting to blaming the @entity129 or @entity115 for their ills , @entity1 might begin to look more like @entity220 than @entity221			2
one good start along this path would be for the government to privatize @entity225 and the country 's steel mills , which hemorrhage public money and perform quite poorly			0
but this would require real political leadership , something that is in short supply in @entity1			0
while @entity1 's institutions are slowly maturing , its political class remains largely moribund .			1

@entity236 : the @entity237 looks at @entity1 as a country in dire straits
despite the politics , @entity236 says @entity1 's society is more stable than it first appears
civil society is stronger and @entity1 has agreed to trade pact with @entity115 , he points out
@entity248 : @entity1 's military has acted to protect the nation from @entity11 threat
