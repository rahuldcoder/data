-- the situation along the @entity3 southern border is complicated			1
there are no easy answers to the problem of thousands of desperate children , many unaccompanied minors , fleeing chaos , violence and governmental collapse in @entity12			1
yet seeing some of my fellow @entity3 jeering busloads of frightened children and hearing commentators dismiss these children as someone else 's problem has left me wondering exactly what kind of country we have turned into , and how quickly we forget our own history			1
my grandfather arrived on @entity26 in 1907 as an unaccompanied 9 - year - old from an impoverished small town in what is now @entity30			1
the situation he fled was probably less dire than that of many of the @entity12 arriving today			2
but it was bad enough			2
his widowed mother 's only alternative to destitution was a quick remarriage , but the presence of the strong - willed boy was a serious impediment to her prospects			2
so little @entity45 was farmed out to his elderly grandmother , for whom he was clearly too much to handle			1
he continually ran away from home and school , sometimes for days at time			2
@entity45 became a kind of unlikely @entity51 mascot of a local gang of @entity54 teens			1
with a child 's unerring instinct of how to get under the skin of his new , strictly observant stepfather , he began to eat pork with his rough companions			2
decades later he would recall his days as a freedom - loving village hooligan with a mischievous grin , but it does not take much historical imagination to understand why the adults around him were terrified			2
political violence , anti-semitic pogroms , criminal gangs and violent state repression were all on the rise in the waning days of the @entity75 empire			2
in this dangerous , chaotic time , @entity45 must have seemed headed for certain disaster			1
the local rabbi was consulted and a course of action was recommended : send the incorrigible little delinquent off to live with his late father 's cousins in @entity12 — a land so full of incorrigible delinquents that one more would scarcely be noticed			2
@entity45 arrived at @entity26 penniless and alone			1
social workers kept him there until they found a cousin willing to claim him			0
it did n't take , however			0
sixty years later he told me this cousin had a big beard and reminded him of the teachers and rabbis back in the shtetl that he had run away from in the first place			0
whatever the real reason , by age 11 he had run away from the cousin , too , and was more or less on his own for good			0
early days in @entity12 were not auspicious			0
he wandered the streets of @entity105 's @entity104 and @entity106 , sleeping in a stable and working for pennies by helping out teamsters on their wagons			1
in his late teens he became a boxer — never very good — and a bouncer at a saloon			0
only 5 - foot - 2 , he acquired the nickname of " @entity115 " a tribute to a street brawler named @entity118 whose fighting style he emulated			0
the name stuck for the rest of his life			0
he did stints in orphanages and reformatories and a short one in adult jail , when he lied about his age to avoid the juvenile authorities			0
and yet , from this unpromising beginning , an @entity3 family sprang			1
after this rocky start -- @entity118 , like many thousands of other one time " unaccompanied minors " — eventually became a very solid @entity3			1
he volunteered for the @entity134 during @entity135 and became an @entity3 citizen			1
after the war he started a small moving business that grew to be modestly successful , employing about a dozen men			0
he married a @entity3 - born girl whose family came from his hometown			1
together they ran the business , raised two sons who later served in the @entity3 military and went on to successful careers			1
@entity118 and his wife lived to see their grandchildren , who eventually became reasonably decent and productive @entity3			1
and , much to the annoyance of those grandchildren , my grandparents also became knee - jerk patriots , loudly supporting all things @entity3 even at the height of the @entity157			1
not knowing his real birthday , @entity118 always listed july 4 as his date of birth			0
he voted , joined civic groups and paid taxes			0
indeed , one of my father 's favorite stories about my grandfather concerned a year in the late 1940s when his accountant told him that after depreciation on his trucks and various other deductions , he owed no federal tax			2
@entity118 would have none of it			0
to the accountant 's horror , he insisted on writing a check for the same amount he had paid the previous year			0
@entity12 had taken him in when he was a hungry , frightened child			0
whatever his shortcomings , @entity12 had allowed him to prosper by the sweat of his brow			0
now a successful man , he was not going to hide behind some accountant 's tricks and shirk his duty to pay his fair share			0
paying his share was what a man did			0
it was what an @entity3 did			1
while he never lost his youthful distaste for organized religion , he had an almost religious belief in the essential goodness of his adopted homeland			0
and yes , @entity118 broke the rules and occasionally some laws to get here and survive here			0
if that is a contradiction , it is the kind of contradiction that animates many @entity3 lives			1
that is the kind of country we are , and for the most part , it 's worked out pretty well			0
i wonder how many people screaming at frightened children in @entity211 , @entity212 , have an ancestor with a similar story			2
i wonder why so many @entity3 have forgotten their history			1
and i wonder , if they are allowed to stay , what sort of @entity3 will the brave , resilient children on those buses someday become ?			1

@entity220 : children at border a complicated problem ; some fellow @entity3 *uncharitable*
he says grandfather sent to @entity105 from @entity30 in 1907 at 9 . his parents *feared* growing violence
@entity45 was penniless , *scrappy* , made his way on his own ; married , had kids , was patriotic
@entity220 : @entity45 was a loyal , *industrious* citizen . have border *protesters* forgotten their roots ?
