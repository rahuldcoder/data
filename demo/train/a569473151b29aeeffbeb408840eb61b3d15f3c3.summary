@entity0 -- it 's the place where countless teenagers have spent a saturday afternoon meeting friends and browsing racks , but now one of the world 's oldest music retailers is in difficulties after its management announced this week it was going into administration			1
when @entity12 opened its first store on @entity0 's @entity14 in 1921 , it sold gramophones , sheet music and recordings			1
in the 1960s , @entity18 cut their first demo in the store 's studio and in the 1980s , live aid founder @entity23 opened @entity12 's @entity25 shop -- believed to be the world 's biggest entertainment store			1
but the chain of more than 200 stores has failed to keep up in the digital age -- putting 4,000 jobs at risk			1
industry analysts look at the reasons for the store 's demise			2
how did @entity12 end up in this position ? the music industry has undergone many changes over @entity12 's long history but perhaps one of the most significant developments has been the growth of digital recordings			1
in a 2012 report , the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) said cd and other physical recorded music sales had dropped from 145.8 million units in 2007 to 92.1 million in 2011 -- a slump of more than 20 %			2
this contrasted with a rise in sales of single digital tracks and digital albums combined from 84.2 million units in 2007 to 202.8 million units in 2011 -- that 's more than double in four years			1
@entity60 estimated that in 2011 @entity12 was still the largest retailer in the @entity62 's recorded music market -- with its digital and physical sales accounting for 22.9 % of overall expenditure			1
but its figures showed that @entity66 was catching up , with 22.4 %			0
of that 22.4 % market share , 14.3 % came from home delivery and 4.4 % from digital downloads			0
@entity71 @entity70 put the importance of the download into focus by releasing his latest single on @entity76 last week rather than on cd			0
according to @entity60 , @entity76 had 12.8 % of the @entity62 's music market share in 2011			1
why did n't @entity12 do well in the digital market place ? in fairness , @entity12 hung on longer than its rivals over the last 20 years like @entity81 , our price , @entity84 and , latterly , @entity85			1
@entity12 has invested in the online market , selling music from @entity12 and in 2009 buying a 50 % stake in smaller digital company @entity89 -- but analysts believe the company left its run too late			1
@entity93 -- retail research director for research agency @entity94 -- says @entity12 " failed to keep up " and that by the time the company focused on online sales the key players had already been established			1
" because @entity12 was n't able to break into that strong core group of players it was always going end up in this situation			2
" what does the future look like for other in store music and video retailers ? there are only a few hundred independent record stores left in @entity62 and @entity107 estimates that by 2015 about 90 % of music and video sales will be made online			1
supermarkets and non-specialist stores are expected to make up some of the 10 % of sales @entity107 predicts will still be made in store by 2014			1
with more innovative ways of accessing music -- through online streaming , @entity118 and @entity119 for example -- the physical product is likely to play a much more depleted role			0
" by the end of the decade , the physical product will be seen as a thing of the past , " @entity93 says			0
what advantages do the online competition have ? @entity12 's real estate costs -- to maintain a presence in city centers -- as well as staff wages , gave it overheads that can be avoided by some online competitors			2
but campaign group @entity134 argues that rivals such as @entity66 also have an advantage in the way they pay tax			0
spokesman @entity139 says the @entity62 government has failed to tackle tax avoidance			1
" now that failure appears to be one of the main reasons companies like @entity12 can no longer compete with tax avoiding giants like @entity66 , " he says			1
@entity66 has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment from @entity1			0
is any action being taken to change the tax situation ? in a speech in december 2012 , @entity62 prime minister @entity150 said he was putting the issue of low taxes paid by multinationals " at the top of the agenda " for the @entity157			2
" it 's simply not fair and not right what some of them are doing by saying , i 've got lots of sales here in the @entity62 but i 'm going to pay a sort of royalty fee to another company that i own in another country that has some special tax dispensation , " he said			1
similarly , @entity169 is looking at why multinationals are able to avoid paying sales tax when selling to @entity169 consumers			2
the country 's technology minister is also considering ways of ensuring internet giants help subsidize the networks they run on			0
earlier this year , the @entity179 reported that @entity181 - based @entity180 was shutting down its online retail business after the government closed the @entity184 ( @entity184 ) loophole			1
the @entity184 allowed items valued at less than Â £ 15 to avoid sales tax in the @entity62			1
what allure do record shops have in a digital age ? online shopping and digital downloads may be convenient , but some argue they lack the " romance " of a traditional record store , especially one with informed staff			2
@entity198 's associate editor @entity197 says consumers can actually talk to people in shops and benefit from the curation that sales staff can provide			2
" the great thing about record shops as opposed to online is that you can go in and see racks , " he says			0
" that 's the big thing -- that sort of spotting things and thinking ' great i want to listen to that '			0
" online shoppers tend to type in the specific name of a band whose music they are interested in , reducing the likelihood of a chance purchase , @entity197 says			0
" it would be a real detriment to the culture to lose a high street presence across the country because i think it 's one way that people discover things that they were n't looking for			0
" what about the impact of online shopping on other products ? @entity12 owned book retailer @entity232 between 1998 and 2011			2
in december 2011 , the chain 's new managing director -- @entity236 -- told the independent newspaper that he regarded online retailer @entity66 as " a ruthless , money - making devil			0
" @entity236 said computers were a " terrible environment " in which to select books			0
" all that ' if you read this , you 'll like that ' -- it 's a dismal way to recommend books			0
a physical bookshop in which you browse , see , hold , touch and feel books is the environment you want			0
" he nonetheless acknowledged that @entity232 was developing its own e-book			0
and six months later @entity232 announced it would sell an e-book reader in its stores -- the @entity254 .			0

@entity12 to go into administration after more than 90 years in business
music retail chain has more than 200 stores and 4,000 staff in @entity62
analysts say @entity12 failed to keep up with digital *revolution* , as in - store sales fall
*critics* say *foreign* - based companies are able to avoid @entity62 tax
