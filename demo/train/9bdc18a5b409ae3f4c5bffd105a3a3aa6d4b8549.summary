@entity0 , @entity1 -- the upcoming @entity3 are no stranger to causes or controversy			1
and this year , there is a strong dose of both surrounding the film " @entity10 " -- and its star and director , @entity13			1
this controversy bubbled up when the buzz started that @entity13 could get an @entity3 nomination for best director when the announcements are made thursday			1

in november 1979 , about 300 @entity29 students stormed the @entity24 @entity30 and 66 @entity24 were taken hostage			2
but six @entity24 diplomats escaped and were hidden at the @entity30 by the @entity33 ambassador and his wife			2
the @entity21 agent -- @entity36 , played by @entity13 -- successfully led the mission to evacuate the @entity24 , which involved @entity36 and his associates posing as a @entity33 film crew that was eager to make a movie in @entity27			1

he later wrote a memoir , detailing the events in @entity25			0
" @entity10 " is loosely based on @entity36 's book			1
better make that , very loosely based			0
as movie critics and others have pointed out since the movie opened a few months ago , the filmmakers took lots of dramatic license with the story			2
@entity36 's role is played up , while that of the @entity33 who helped hide and protect the @entity24 is played down			1
some scenes depicted in the film never happened			0
some characters are composites of several real people			2

it 's not a documentary			0
it 's meant to be taken with a grain of salt , and to be entertaining			0
still , there are some @entity82 -- in and out of @entity75 -- who think that , in this case , the filmmakers , and especially @entity13 , pushed the concept of creativity too far			2
they say @entity13 missed an opportunity to put more latinos on screen			2
moreover , they say , @entity13 improperly claimed , for himself , the choice role of @entity36 when he should have cast a @entity93 actor instead			1
they insist that the director did n't just cheat a @entity93 out of an acting job but the @entity93 community out of a feel - good story about one of their own who won acclaim for a heroic deed			1
the critics are right , and their cause is just			0
@entity13 should have tried to cast a @entity93 to play @entity36			1
that 's common sense , and it would have made " @entity10 " a better movie			1
@entity13 also did n't do himself any favors by trying to dismiss the criticism with a glib remark that essentially said that it really does n't matter that the actor playing @entity36 is n't @entity93 since @entity36 himself is n't , shall we say , overtly @entity93			1
read more : the biggest , buzziest movies of 2013 at a recent forum intended to publicize the film , @entity13 responded to a question from the audience about the controversy by noting that " @entity36 does not have , i do n't know what you would say , a @entity125 / @entity124 accent " and that " you would n't necessarily select him out of a line of 10 people and go ' this guy 's @entity93			1
at least @entity13 did n't slip and say " line up			2
" " so i did n't feel as though i was violating something , " he said , " where , here 's this guy who 's clearly ethnic in some way and it 's sort of being whitewashed by @entity13 the actor			1
" @entity137 set a better example			0
several months ago , @entity137 turned down the role of @entity141 revolutionary @entity140 in another film			0
he said that the role should go to a @entity93			1
i praised @entity137 at the time for showing that , besides being a great actor , he is also a person of character			0

this is still a black and white world , where @entity82 rarely get cast in the leading role			0
we 're the gardeners and housekeepers , the gang leader and drug dealers , the nannies and farm workers			0
there has been some progress , of course			0
but not enough -- not when you have a @entity93 in the @entity166 , three @entity82 in the @entity167 , and @entity82 heading @entity169 companies			2
i could blame the environment of @entity1 , in which most @entity75 writers , producers and directors live and spend most of their time			0
when they get up in the morning and drive to work , most @entity82 they encounter are subservient			0
we clean their homes , cook their breakfast , trim their hedges , park their cars and otherwise help them get through the day			0
still , you can push this argument too far , and wind up going down a dangerous path -- one that ultimately sets back the greater cause of trying to get television networks and film studios to create a broader range of meatier roles for @entity93 actors and actresses			2
after all , it 's a short walk from saying that a director should have cast a @entity93 to play a @entity93 to arguing that only @entity82 can play @entity82			1
and , if that 's the argument , then on what moral high ground do @entity82 stand to also push -- as we should -- for @entity93 actors and actresses to be considered for generic and mainstream roles that could have gone to white actors ? we ca n't have it both ways			1
even if @entity82 succeed in making their point about this one director and this one movie , it could backfire			0
we could win this battle , and still lose the war			0
but before @entity82 can be fully integrated into @entity24 and not considered outsiders , we have to take every opportunity to push for inclusion and fairness			0
and acknowledging that @entity82 have the skills to play themselves is a good start			0
join us on @entity217 / @entity216 the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity3 nominations on thursday , and @entity13 expected to get one for " @entity10 "
@entity13 plays real - life @entity93 who helped diplomats escape in @entity27 hostage crisis
@entity220 : @entity13 should have used a @entity93 actor to play role
he says it cheats actor out of a job , and the @entity93 community out of a hero 's story
