the country " has no information whatsoever showing that there existed secret @entity5 detention centers on its territory , " the @entity9 told @entity0			2
two investigations also failed to find any evidence that the @entity5 used @entity1 airports for " rendition , " the process in which detainees in @entity8 custody are transported for questioning to other countries where prohibitions on torture are not as strict and @entity8 laws do n't apply			1
the @entity1 denial comes in response to a plea from the human rights commissioner for the @entity30 that countries that have hosted secret @entity5 prisons come clean			1
@entity32 said @entity1 , @entity33 and @entity34 were among at least seven countries that hosted " black sites " for " enhanced interrogation " during the " war on terror			1
" " darkness still enshrouds those who authorized and ran the black sites on @entity43 territories , " he said			0

@entity33 's @entity68 said it would not comment while prosecutors in the country are still investigating			0
@entity34 has not responded to @entity0 questions about the issue			0
@entity32 's statement comes as documents seized from @entity76 's compound in @entity77 shed light on the program of extraordinary rendition			1
@entity0 saw a march 6 , 2004 , @entity5 letter to @entity77 officials about @entity83 , a former jihadist with the @entity84 and now a senior commander in the @entity87 forces			1
it concerned the @entity90 government 's arrest of @entity91 , @entity83 's nom de guerre for his rendition			2
