@entity0 -- if federal safety advocates get their way , collision avoidance systems that warn drivers about hazards -- and even automatically hit the brakes -- will become as commonplace as seat belts and air bags			1
the @entity10 said wednesday that the federal government should mandate the systems as standard equipment in all cars and commercial vehicles			1
many of the systems are already available as options , typically in luxury cars			1
but the @entity10 said the time is ripe for the federal government to require the systems in all vehicles , saying their " full life - saving and crash - avoidance potential will not be realized " until the government mandates the systems and sets standards for their performance			1
" we know that hundreds of lives can be saved and hundreds of thousands of injuries can be prevented if the technology improves and we can avoid these run - off - the - road , rear - end and also the side lane departure collisions , " @entity10 chairwoman @entity30 told @entity1			1
the safety board called for the change in its updated " @entity41 " of transportation safety improvements			2
six of the 10 issues on the annual list address highway travel , as the board shifted focus to the 35,000 people who die on the nation 's roadways every year			2
the board also added " eliminating distraction in transportation " to its list -- highlighting a concern that has grown as the number of cell phones and other digital devices has proliferated			1
meanwhile , the board removed " fatigue " from its list			0
@entity61 , which has been on the list since it was first created in 1990 , was removed largely because the board feels the issue is being addressed , a board spokesperson said			0
the independent @entity10 has no authority to enact transportation policy , nor to force the federal government to make changes			1
but it makes recommendations to governments , industry and the public and uses its " @entity41 " list as a soap box to affect change			0
@entity30 said collision avoidance technology can help address driver fatigue and distraction			1
people are n't paying attention , " @entity30 said			0
" technology can really be an aid to prevent you from running into the car ahead of your or running off the road			0
" the board specifically endorsed the use of lane departure warning systems , which provide an audible or visual warning , or both , when a car drifts out of a lane when the turn signal is not used			2
it also mentioned automatic braking , electronic stability control and adaptive cruise control , which reduces a car 's speed when appropriate			0
and it endorsed tire pressure monitoring , speed - limiting technology and , for commercial truckers , onboard monitors , which track drivers ' performance			2
tests of existing crash avoidance technology have shown mixed results , according to the @entity111 , an organization funded by insurance companies			2
forward collision avoidance systems , particularly those that brake autonomously , along with headlights which shift direction as the driver steers , show the biggest crash reductions , the @entity111 said			1
lane departure warning " appears to hurt , rather than help , though it 's not clear why , " they said			0
and other systems , such as blind spot detection " are n't showing clear effects on crash patterns yet			0
" in a statement , the @entity126 said wednesday that it is continually working to reduce crashes			0
the administration " already has work underway to help address bus safety issues ... combat impaired driving ... discourage texting and other distracting behavior behind the wheel " and is evaluating crash avoidance technologies			0
" we 've already taken aggressive action to address a number of issues identified by the @entity10 , " the agency said , adding , " we look forward to continuing our work " with the board			1
