-- in a shocking article on @entity3 , author and mother @entity1 writes that moms in her affluent @entity7 neighborhood are going through something called " the 40 - year - old reversion			1
" the tedium of raising children , she says , is driving moms in her circle out at night to party to the extreme as if they were 25 again			1
@entity15 likens the scene to the @entity18 show " girls , " which depicts life in @entity20 for the post-college crowd : " ... we 're masturbating excessively , cheating on good people , doing coke in newly price - inflated townhouses , and sexting compulsivelyâ € ” though rarely with our partners			1
our children now school - aged , our marriages entering their second decade , we are avoiding the big questionsâ € ” should i quit my job ? have another child ? divorce ? â € ” by behaving like a bunch of crazy twentysomething hipsters			1
" it 's a grim portrait of parenthood and marriage			1
and cringe - worthy tales of a drunk mom falling down the stairs while leaving a party and a mom who went to third base in the back of a minivan with a man who was n't her husband could make a person who 's thinking about getting pregnant hit the pause button			1
@entity15 's salacious revelations have some people suggesting she made it all up : her new novel comes out in august , after all			1
( when i contacted @entity15 directly and asked if everything she wrote was true , she referred me to her publicist , who said the author was n't doing interviews until the book releases			1
) but when i think about it , i 've encountered plenty of this mischief myself , particularly the cheating			1
a former co-worker once described how a mom of three threw herself at him on a business trip , claiming she was having a hard time at home and really needed to have sex with him or she 'd die			1
sort of like he was a missing vitamin			1
if there 's an uptick in @entity84 behavior among the @entity7 co-op set , it would n't be anything new			1
@entity91 , if " @entity90 " is any measure , this generation 's mommies were regularly tucked into bed by parents already three sheets to the wind before heading out to the neighborhood key party			1
cultural depictions of modern motherhood tend to be much tamer , however			1
when i became a mom , i never expected i 'd go out nearly as much as i do			1
i thought i 'd always be home knitting mittens , singing lullabies and falling into exhausted sleeps on top of my husband			2
sure , i do all that stuff ( except the knitting )			2
but i also go out for cocktails and adult conversation every couple of weeks or so			2
mind you , the first time i hit the town post-baby was a bit of a disaster			1
@entity20 was in the grips of the worst blizzard it had seen in decades			2
but i was oblivious ; i 'd barely been outside since my daughter 's birth three weeks earlier			2
and the intensity of new motherhood combined with winter confinement was seriously tugging at my sanity			2
a kind of courtship : finding a mom friend in the big city " it 's snowing pretty heavily out there , " my husband cautioned			2
" it is ? we 'll see , " i said , zipping up my boots			2
as soon as i stepped outside , i was waist - deep in snow			2
but instead of going back indoors like a normal person , i waded oafishly through the powdery sea of white to get to the cab			2
over drinks with friends at a bar downtown , i shared baby pictures on my phone , my eyes misting with pride			2
i laughed loudly at everyone 's jokes -- even the average ones			2
it felt so wonderful to be out in the world again ! but by the time the joint was clearing out , the storm had progressed mightily			2
cabs and subways could no longer operate			2
so i did what every good parent warns you not to -- i accepted a ride from a stranger who was voluntarily circling the city in an off - road vehicle rescuing lost souls and delivering them home			2
my eyes scrunched shut the whole way uptown , i prayed that this nice man was n't going to feed me to his rottweiler			1
i also prayed my daughter would never do anything this stupid			0
there 's something about @entity20 that makes misbehaving seem a little less like misbehaving			0
it 's like the city dares you to take risks and try new things while seductively whispering in your ear , " i wo n't tell anyone			1
" i once struck up a conversation at a bar with two ladies in their early 40s , both married with kids , who were very comfortable admitting they were having affairs			1
" my one piece of advice , " one of them told me like it was a given i 'd eventually need to know the ins and outs of cheating			0
" delete all your text messages			0
delete , delete , delete			0
" i 'm jealous of my baby -- a @entity198 confession another sliver of wisdom , this time from a pr executive and mother of two grown children , was that if i was ever tempted by another man i should " jump in with both feet " regardless of my marital status			1
" falling in love is n't something you should ever pass up , " she said			1
even if it might tear my whole family apart ? of course it 's not just a @entity20 thing			0
when having dinner at a pub in @entity218 , @entity219 , my girlfriend , a local , started pointing out patrons she knew who were at the bar cheating on their spouses			0
they were all parents and none of them seemed to be looking over their shoulders			0
later she introduced me to a couple with kids who decided to make their marriage an open one after the wife 's affair with a neighbor was exposed			0
perhaps it 's not so hard to see how some of this happens			0
to save money on sitters , it 's often just one parent who goes out			0
after a few rounds at the bar , mom might start to actually feel a little on the single side			0
and her susceptibility to do something nutty might correlate to the challenging -- even desperate -- day she had			0
while i 've not made out with a bartender or snorted cocaine off the back of a toilet seat recently , there has definitely been some less - than - honorable after - dark behavior since i became a mother			1
sometimes you 've just got to blow off a bit of parental steam			1
nights out with my newly single friend @entity260 are often something to behold			0
one time we got into a heated , alcohol - fueled argument at a @entity265 bar with a bunch of lawyers because one of them told me my dress was awful			0
the argument concluded when @entity260 threatened to take all the lawyers outside and " hit their faces			0
" then there was the time , emboldened by a couple of glasses of white , i told a stranger his girlfriend reminded me of a prostitute i 'd seen in the paper			0
@entity260 scolded me and said i needed to work on channeling my inner @entity282			0
celebs and civilians alike expected to ' bounce back ' after baby while there 's nothing wrong with a mom embracing her precious moments of freedom , there is certainly an old - fashioned expectation swirling that once thou hast procreated , thou shalt be home by 8 p.m. while enjoying the conversation at a concert after - party well past midnight a few months back , i kept getting worried glances from a dad			0
" should n't you be at home ? " he said			1
" should we get you into a cab soon ? " clearly his wife does n't go out			1
after a while he just went quiet around me , as though he suspected that my partying was indicative of deep problems at home			0
truth be told , i actually enjoy going out more now , simply because i 'm a parent			0
there 's a sense of accomplishment that i have n't felt before , having co-created this awesome little creature who giggles her way through the day			1
these days i feel lighter and happier when i 'm on the town			0
i laugh more because my baby constantly reminds me how funny we all are			0
i relax more because i know it 's useless wasting rare moments away from the house on being uptight			0
also , the pressure 's off			0
i 'm one of the lucky ones who does n't have to size up every dude in the bar to see if they fit the husband mold			1
my husband is at home playing video games or dozing peacefully in the room next to my sleeping kid			0
or , even better , it 's date night and he 's right in front of me topping up my wine			0
my nights out end the same way , with me going back to a home that makes me happy			0
i 'd like to think i 'm progressing , not regressing			0
sure , i 'm not perfect , as a few benders with @entity260 can attest to , but i seem to be getting the balance down			0
meanwhile , the party moms who delight in taking things into the danger zone did n't invent the art of smoking illicit joints and having tawdry affairs			1
they 're just keeping the torch ( or bong , or hot sex flame , whatever the case may be ) alive			1
yes , it 's all been done			0
the question is , will it be their undoing ? revisiting battlegrounds of the sexes do you know moms who 've gone overboard in an effort to blow off a little steam ? share your experiences in the comments section below .			1
