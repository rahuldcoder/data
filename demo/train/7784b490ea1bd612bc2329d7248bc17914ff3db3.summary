before the high - velocity trip , prosecutors say , the troopers altered their license plates by using black electrical tape to change the numbers			1
@entity11 is said to have instructed the other drivers in the caravan to " conceal or partially conceal their plates using tape or other means , " according to a press release from the office of attorney general @entity37 " no one is above the law , and the public expects and deserves a higher level of conduct from our state troopers , most of whom deliver admirably and professionally in that regard , " @entity37 said			1
" the conduct alleged here jeopardized public safety and undermined the trust the public places in law enforcement and the @entity56			2
serious misconduct by any state trooper must be met with serious discipline and , where warranted and appropriate , criminal charges			1
" @entity12 's attorney could not be reached friday , but @entity11 's attorney , @entity62 said his client acknowledges running the escort was a bad idea , but that he refutes allegations he altered his license plate			2
he points to @entity11 's 25 year service record as proof			0
" sgt. @entity11 denies the charges , admits the escort was a mistake and has moved to retire as a result , and will fight these charges and for his well earned pension after an otherwise unblemished career			1

the attorney general 's office said that while their investigation remains open , it is " unlikely " any of the sports car drivers will be charged with any crimes			2
" here is the real issue , " @entity62 said			0
" my client denies he told anyone to tape their plates while some unknown number of affluent exotic car owners explained their taped plates by saying the trooper said to do it			0
