-- it should come as no surprise that even after consumer - friendly bank reform it costs more than ever to use your own money			1
a veritable credit card fee frenzy over the past decade meant many banks could easily offer free checking and other perks , subsidized by the big fees generated elsewhere			1
( a checking account costs the typical bank $ 100 to $ 200 to set up and maintain			2
) but now that these fees have been tamed by new rules , fees are rising elsewhere			2
new analysis by @entity18 shows fewer banks offer free checking and the costs associated with your bank account are rising			1
you can be charged by the bank to hold your money for you , if you do n't have a minimum balance			0
you can be charged to take your own money out of an atm			0
and you will still pay if you bounce a check or overdraw your account with a debit card			0
average atm fees are up 5 percent , to an all - time high of $ 2.33 , and the average out - of - network charge to use an atm for another bank is $ 1.41			1
overdraft fees rose another 3 percent to $ 30.47 and the cost to maintain a checking account rose on average to $ 13.04 a month -- that 's the cost for not keeping the minimum in an interest bearing account			1
the typical consumer pays $ 620 year in unnecessary and avoidable fees , @entity18 's senior financial analyst @entity45 figures			1
here 's how to avoid paying the bank for the use of your money : never use an out of network atm machine walk or drive the extra distance			1
it is literally the easiest money you can save in your budget			0
avoid overdrafts avoiding one overdraft a month saves you $ 360 a year			1
there are new rules to protect you from the most egregious overdraft fees , but make no mistake , you ca n't spend money you do n't have in the account			0
do not opt in for overdraft protection for your debit card			0
unfortunately , the consumers getting dinged by overdraft fees tend to be what i call " fee - quent fliers			2
" @entity75 reported last week that 10 percent of its customers generate 70 percent of its overdraft fees			0
strive to not be a fee - quent flier			0
shop around for bank accounts if you have a low balance and your bank will charge you a few dollars for dipping below a minimum level , check out community banks and credit unions			2
bottom line , do n't pay to use your own money .			0
