@entity0 -- the question of same - sex marriage went again before the @entity5 @entity4 on wednesday in the last of two oral arguments this week in separate appeals			1
this session dealt with the @entity10 , passed by @entity11 in 1996			1
it said , in part , that legally married same - sex couples can not enjoy the range of financial and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples			2
here are five things we learned from arguments in this case : 1			0
opening the gateways a @entity4 justice is sometimes like a fussy 8 - year - old			1
she must eat her peas before any dessert			0
the dessert , of course , in the same sex - marriage cases are the constitutional " equal protection questions " -- the ones that get to the heart of defining what marriage is all about , the ones the entire nation wants answered			0
the second day of hearings : majority of justices raise questions but wednesday 's green vegetables are the gateway or the jurisdictional barriers that must first be confronted			1
the justices spent the first 50 minutes of their two - hour argument deciding whether they should even be there			0
can @entity48 @entity47 defend the @entity10 when the president refuses to do so ? it 's no small matter			1
the executive branch , by tradition and statute , is charged with defending acts of @entity11			1
the @entity55 was doing just that when @entity10 was being adjudicated by a federal judge in @entity57			1
then an abrupt about - face			0
so one house of @entity11 decided it had to step in			0
" let 's not confuse the issue of @entity10 and the administration 's decision that it was unconstitutional , " house speaker @entity59 , @entity60 , told @entity1 last week			1
" it is not their role to decide what 's constitutional			2
@entity10 was a law that was passed by the @entity48 and @entity70 and signed into law by president @entity72			1
" in our system of government , the administration does n't get to decide what 's constitutional -- the @entity4 does			1
... our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what 's constitutional and what is n't			1
" read and listen to two days ' of arguments for yourself chief justice @entity85 at argument seemed to agree , suggesting the @entity48 was trying to have it both ways -- believing @entity10 was unconstitutional but continuing to defend it anyway			1
if @entity91 " has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional , i do n't see why he does n't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute , but do it consistent with his view of the @entity98 , rather than saying -- oh , we 'll wait until the @entity4 tells us we have no choice			1
" opinion : chief justice reveals he 's fed up with @entity91 2			1
the moment , courtesy of @entity103 most hot - button @entity4 cases have a " moment , " a comment or heated exchange that leaves onlookers with mouths agape and reporters scribbling furiously to mine the gold			1
wednesday 's memorable remarks came from justice @entity103 , about 68 minutes into the arguments			1
@entity115 , the attorney representing the @entity48 @entity47 , suggested that when @entity10 was passed " in 1996 , something was happening " -- states were considering whether to upset the " traditional " view of marriage and include gay and lesbian couples			1
" in a sense , " said @entity115 , " it was forcing @entity11 to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the states and its historic practice of preferring uniformity			0
protesters pack @entity4 grounds " i 'm going to quote from the @entity135 here , " said @entity103 firmly , referring to the official recommendation from various congressional committees on the law 's intent			1
" that ' @entity11 decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality			0
' is that what happened in 1996 ? " there were audible gasps in the courtroom			2
it deflated suggestions @entity11 merely wanted federal uniformity			0
" when @entity11 targets a group that is not everybody 's favorite group in the world , that we look at those cases -- even if they 're not suspect -- with some rigor to say : do we really think that @entity11 was doing this for uniformity reasons , or do we think that @entity11 ' judgment was infected by dislike , by fear , by animus ? " she asked			2
" and whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that 's what was going on			2
" it was a simple , direct and stunningly effective tactic by the so - called " junior " justice			2
she did not need to express her own personal judicial views on the law			0
she let @entity11 ' own words speak for itself -- albeit in a 2013 political and social lens			0
new members to the bench have their own internal " learning curve , " where they try to navigate the complexities and rhythms of their new home -- oral argument , opinion writing and the personal dynamics between one 's eight colleagues , all brilliant legal minds			1
but @entity103 has seemed to pick things up quickly , especially remarkable since she 's the only current member of the @entity4 never to have been a judge before			1
she is confident at oral argument and can write opinions quickly			0
she and justice @entity188 , who preceded @entity103 by a year , have found their footing			1
in their own way , they have become forces unto themselves			0
16 braves and humorous signs on same - sex marriage 3			0
@entity4 's conservatives go tepid as subdued as the more liberal justices were tuesday over @entity200 's @entity199 , the voter initiative banning same - sex marriage , so conservatives appeared wednesday over @entity10			1
@entity85 and justice @entity203 have been known to dominate especially high - profile debates , by turns passionate , clever and funny			1
much of their energy was missing when the debate turned to congressional authority			0
@entity210 , attorney for key plaintiff @entity211 , made a bold statement in favor of gay rights , saying a " sea change " was happening in the country in favor of same - sex marriage			2
such sweeping rhetoric from counsel is usually an invitation to a verbal smackdown from the justices			0
they like specifics , not speeches			0
@entity203 had his chance for a tailor - made " moment " of his own but did not pounce			2
by the numbers : same - sex marriage " why are you so confident in that judgment ? " he asked mildly			0
" how many states permit gay couples to marry ? " when told just nine , all @entity203 could retort was , " so there has been this sea change between now and 1996			2
" the conservative justices were not exactly sitting on their hands , but aside from justice @entity242 , who never speaks at argument , their energy was noticeably absent			1
so is @entity10 doomed ? it 's an almost reflexive attitude among many legal and political experts to downplay the influence justice @entity247 possesses as the so - called swing vote among the divided conservative - liberal bench			1
giving any one person in @entity0 that much credit just does n't seem right , in the view of some			2
he certainly has done everything in his power to dismiss it , calling his ability to make or break a hot - button appeal a " myth			0
" but it was hard to ignore remarks @entity247 made about an hour into the argument , which may give cheer to gay rights supporters			0
he pointed out there are about 1100 various federal provisions that legally married same - sex couples can not use because of @entity10 -- everything from taxes to family medical leave			1
" which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with the citizens ' day - to - day life , you are at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the state police power , which is to regulate marriage , divorce , custody , " he said			0
woman at the center of the case they were brief comments , delivered in the typical droll manner that is the low - key justice			1
he never dominates arguments , but when he talks , ears perk up			0
even the justices on the bench were looking his way , absorbing the impact of what @entity247 was trying to convey			0
any real power would be felt behind the red velvet curtains of the courtroom , where all important opinions are written			0
that is where the court derives its power and authority and where the views of this 76 - year - old @entity200 must be respected			2
waiting for the final act so what 's next ? in short , the public waits while the justices write			1
the members will meet privately later this week in a special conference room -- just the nine of them with no clerks , staff or reporters allowed			0
there , the court is expected to vote -- at least preliminarily -- on the two same - sex marriage appeals			2
opinion writing will commence , endless drafts will be exchanged among chambers and suggestions for changes will come flooding			0
bit by bit , the makings of legal opinion take shape			2
justices are free to change their mind midstream -- and they do			0
witness @entity85 last year during the challenge to the health care reform law championed by @entity91			2
government sources confirm @entity85 switched sides several weeks after an initial vote and was the controlling vote to uphold @entity340			0
the internal drama will play out over the next three months , unseen by the public			0
the court 's high profile will re-emerge when their ruling is issued , but the guessing game has already begun			1
couple at the center of @entity199 case			0

@entity4 hears a challenge to the @entity10
a key legal question : can @entity48 defend @entity10 when executive branch wo n't ?
justice @entity103 's reading from 1996 act provides wednesday 's " moment "
the high court 's conservatives were noticeably subdued
