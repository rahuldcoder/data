on @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6 two weeks ago			0
opposite the @entity7 , right at the heart of the art establishment , on gallery row itself , @entity13 art formerly seen as a niche interest , now officially playing with the big boys			1
and the best thing ... @entity3 is owned and run by a woman : @entity18 born @entity19			0
just down the road in @entity21 is @entity22 , a gallery that specializes in @entity25 art , also run by a woman , this time @entity27 who spent her childhood in @entity30			1
@entity32 partners with the @entity33 in @entity34 , again run by another woman , @entity36			0
it would appear that women are at the vanguard of raising the profile of contemporary @entity13 art. and for those who may point out that three female curators do not a trend make , name checks to chief @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 to list a few			1
if female curators are a rarity , @entity30 - focused female curators are even more so			0
yet the message of these women is not a gendered manifesto but a simple statement of fact : contemporary african art exists			2
not only does it exist , it thrives			0
not only does it thrive , it does pretty well at auctions , as the annual @entity60 's ' @entity59 ' auction attests to			0
read this : @entity63 brings @entity13 art to world stage growing up , my conception of @entity13 art was limited to ivory masks and wooden sculptures			1
art was what our ancestors did			2
@entity13 artists were dead and anonymous			2
a quick browse on the @entity77 ' african art ' entry does much to confirm this outmoded view			2
the page boasts a smiling mysterious mask from @entity81 , a bellicose @entity83 bronze head from the 12th century and a @entity85 terracotta sculpture from the 6th century @entity86 deader the better where the @entity13 artist is concerned it seems			2
yet @entity13 art is alive			1
one can not view the pulsating wall length panels of @entity92 , or the playful metal work of @entity94 and declare these pieces artifacts			0
nor view the sculptures of @entity97 made from recycled @entity98 and say these are artists working with only traditional materials			0
nor listen to the acoustic art of @entity102 and say this new generation is confined to the usual mediums			2
the art coming from @entity30 today is as varied , vibrant , exhilarating and bewildering as contemporary art from anywhere in the world			1
and not only is this art alive , it is for the first time , moving through proper distribution channels			1
no more the @entity114 treasure hunter , grabbing sacred artifacts , sacking sacred temples and carting off the spoils to institutions like the @entity119 and the @entity120			0
instead today , the business - like curator , the technologically savvy artist , with work cleared through customs on both ends and profits split sensibly			0
this unfolding success story of contemporary african art comes at a good time for the continent			1
no matter what one might say of the trajectory of some @entity13 governments , there is no doubt that @entity13 culture is on the rise			1
first the rise of afro - pop music ( @entity140 , @entity141 ) then the rise of the @entity13 actor ( @entity144 , @entity145 ) and now perhaps the rise of the contemporary @entity13 artist ( @entity92 , @entity147 )			1
to the female curators at the forefront of the movement , i salute you			0
and to the public , grab their works while you can			0
read this : @entity63 brings @entity13 art to world stage read this : why ca n't @entity25 watch country 's biggest movie ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1

@entity13 contemporary art is thriving , says *author* @entity167
she says that for the first time it is moving through proper distribution channels
" there is no doubt that @entity13 culture is on the rise , " says @entity167
