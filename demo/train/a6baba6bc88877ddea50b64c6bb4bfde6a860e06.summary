@entity1 , @entity0 -- they arrived at the church with only what they could carry : clothes , pictures and a few family heirlooms			1
it 's all that is left of a life before the islamic state terror group swept into northern @entity14 , giving the @entity15 of @entity16 and @entity17 an ultimatum : convert , leave or die			1
most , like @entity19 and his family , fled first to the relative safety of @entity14 's @entity23 capital of @entity24 and then made their way to @entity1 , @entity0 , where they found sanctuary in a church			1
roughly 100 @entity14 christians are being sheltered at @entity31 in the @entity33 neighborhood of @entity1			1
their sanctuary offers little more than floor mats and a roof , but it 's a welcome haven after fleeing @entity38 persecution			1
" @entity41 told people , ' leave everything and follow me , ' " @entity19 said , cradling his 9 - month - old daughter , @entity40			2
" the stress and strain of the journey show in @entity19 's tired eyes			2
" we had to leave everything and go ... to be @entity15 , to stay in my religion , " he said			1
safe haven @entity0 's capital of @entity1 has become a magnet for many refugees in recent years trying to escape war or persecution			1
more than 1 million @entity57 fleeing a civil war have poured into the tiny desert kingdom , and hundreds of thousands of @entity14 -- many of them @entity15 -- have sought haven from the sectarian fighting and later @entity38			1
the country 's population has swelled , with the @entity64 estimating more than 645,000 refugees have made their way to @entity1 , according to 2014 figures			1
that number does not include the refugee camps that have been set up near its border crossings with @entity57 and the @entity71 , home to a large number of @entity74			1
families flee @entity17 the influx of refugees has put a strain on the country , and nowhere is that more evident than at @entity31 , where about 500 refugees , including some @entity82 , have walked through the doors , father @entity76 said			1
many are children who arrived sick " because of the trauma of the incidents they suffered in @entity14 : fear , insecure , no food , " @entity76 said			1
" they left their homes in a few hours ... leaving everything behind them			2
it 's a very big shock			2
that 's why i do my best to help these people to overcome this situation and to ( help them ) look for a better life			2
" the church helps the refugees as much as it can , with charity from nonprofits , but mostly private donations			2
some of the @entity15 refugees live in the church , on the floor			1
others live in nearby apartments rented by the church until they are granted asylum , a process that can drag on for years			2
@entity38 overtakes @entity14 's largest @entity15 city " we do n't know how many days or months they stay with us ; that 's why i think any kind of help is welcome , " @entity76 said			1
@entity116 rests little these days , spending his time welcoming visitors , helping new arrivals and , sometimes , taking the children on excursions to help them forget			2
he does it all with a big , wide smile			2
still , he knows it will be difficult for the refugees , who after months on the move need rest and time to apply for visas to relocate to @entity129 , the @entity130 or @entity131			2
" i learned so much from them , their patience and solidarity			2
i am very happy to be with them , to be serving these people , " he says , just minutes before he comforts a woman -- a refugee -- in tears over the frustrating process of applying for asylum			0
" when someone knocks on my door , i can not say no. i have to say yes and give any kind of help , " @entity76 said			0
" my church , my school , my heart is open for every single one who comes to ask for help , " he said			0
@entity15 faith the @entity14 families at the church have built their own small community , with the women take turns cooking and children sharing toys			1
@entity19 lives with his wife and two children in a room crowded with at least three other families			0
their suitcases are piled along the entrance , and their laundry hangs from the windows			0
@entity19 's children , @entity40 and toddler @entity170 , may never see @entity14 again -- a price their father says he is willing to pay to keep his faith			1
before the @entity130 - led invasion of @entity14 in 2003 , @entity14 's @entity15 population was estimated at more than 1 million			1
by the time the war was over , it dwindled to less than a third of that			0
@entity15 flee @entity14 ahead of @entity38 @entity17 , @entity14 's second - largest city , and its surrounds were home to an estimated 60,000 @entity15 prior to @entity38 sweeping in			1
since @entity38 fighters took control of the city , all have left , according to @entity187 , a nonprofit aid group working to resettle refugees			1
" maybe in two years or three years , you will not see any @entity15 in @entity14			1
all of them they will leave , " @entity19 said			0
picking up the pieces there is nothing to go back to , says @entity194 , a 57 - year - old mother of five who fled @entity17			1
" i do n't want to go back			0
they took our belongings , " she said			0
" i have nothing to go back to			0
i want to go to @entity130			0
" the refugees all tell similar tales of the night of june 10 , when @entity38 fighters seized control of @entity17			1
for @entity209 , there is life before @entity38 and life after			1
" it 's very hard to describe			0
( life ) changed 180 degrees			0
it felt like a dream			0
the first few days , we were wishing to sleep and wake up and it would all turn out to be a dream , " she said , shaking her head			0
with her 7 - year - old daughter lying across her lap , @entity223 recalled how she and her family worked for years to build their lives " in the home of our ancestors " and then how it just ended			0
" all of a sudden , they threaten you			0
they uprooted us , " she said , fighting back tears			0
@entity223 's daughter is struggling to cope , recalling the belongings she left behind in @entity17			2
" ' if only we 'd brought that pillow ' or ' if only we 'd brought that toy , ' " @entity223 said her daughters tells her			0
" i left without saying goodbye to my parents -- their graves			0
i still see them , " she said , her voice trailing off as she remembered			0
" my childhood home ... i wake up and wish i could go back , " she said , looking at her hands , tears rolling down her cheeks			0
long wait for peace sitting on a plastic chair in his living room across the street from the church , sipping hot @entity261 coffee under a poster of @entity263 , 60 - year - old @entity264 takes a drag from his cigarette			0
he points to 1991 as the start of @entity14 's problems : the @entity268			2
back then , he says , he named his son @entity270 -- @entity271 for peace -- " because we were waiting for peace			0
" " now he is 23 , and still we are waiting , " he said			0
