@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a dusty , pot - holed road south from the @entity6 capital , @entity0 , there is a battered sign in @entity9			1
" @entity20 , " it says , pointing the way to the town on the @entity13 where @entity15 prime minister @entity14 , @entity17 premier @entity16 and @entity19 president @entity18 met secretly in february 1945			1
it was at this @entity6 resort that the " @entity25 " debated the future of @entity24 nearly 70 years later , @entity6 is again at the heart of that argument			1
most historians conclude that @entity16 was the " winner " at @entity20			2
there was little discussion of @entity24 , which was soon to fall within the @entity17 orbit			1
@entity14 and @entity18 won no meaningful concessions on @entity34 , already occupied by @entity17 troops			2
the ailing @entity19 president 's main aim was to win agreement on setting up the @entity39 , where the @entity19 and @entity17 would spend the next 40 years vetoing each other 's resolutions in the @entity42			1
@entity20 was the preamble to the @entity44			2
facts on the ground -- the sweep westward of the @entity48 -- strengthened @entity16 's hand			0
in the @entity50 after returning from the conference , @entity14 asked of the @entity34 : " are their sovereignty and independence to be untrammeled , or are they to become a mere projection of the @entity17 state ? " the answer -- a sham election in 1947 that sealed @entity62 rule -- was not long in coming			1
the @entity63 , a term coined by @entity14 , may have long fallen , holding out the promise to what former @entity17 leader @entity66 called " our common @entity69 home			2
" but arguments over sovereignty , self - determination and spheres of influence are suddenly electric again			1
and they are playing out in the @entity6			0
land hungry or quelling ' fascists ' ? the @entity80 flag already flies across @entity6			1
pro-ukrainian rallies attract a couple of hundred people			0
most @entity1 here seem resigned to the new order , although a steady stream have taken the train north to stay in @entity87 , for the time being at least			0
cossacks now guard government buildings , and the new self - installed government talks of plans for adopting the ruble and @entity95 's time - zone			0
billboards proclaiming " together with @entity80 " are everywhere			0
flights from @entity1 into @entity0 , currently suspended , will be directed to the international terminal if they ever resume			0
and a border , with barbed wire and checkpoints , is already taking shape across the neck of land that joins @entity6 to the rest of @entity1			1
the other evening , an elderly man shuffled in the shadow of the statue of @entity108 that still dominates @entity0 's largest square			0
he carried a flag , the hammer and sickle of the @entity17 era , and a photograph , of @entity16			0
to older @entity80 here who remember the collaboration of some @entity1 with the @entity119 , the nationalist politicians now in government in @entity87 are " fascists			1
" they claim the " @entity124 " in @entity1 is planning to sabotage sunday 's referendum in @entity6 with acts of provocation			1
referendum billboards in @entity126 -- the home of @entity80 's @entity128 -- display maps of @entity80 and @entity1 , the latter stamped with a swastika			1
and then there is the opposite narrative			0
many @entity1 -- including interim prime minister @entity134 -- think @entity80 president @entity135 wants to expand @entity80 to the old borders of the @entity17			1
they say that if @entity95 is allowed to annex @entity6 , it will look hungrily to eastern @entity1 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
they lament what they saw as the @entity144 's indifference when @entity80 tanks came within 50 miles of the @entity139 capital @entity147 in 2008			0
and they fear @entity135 will continue to do all in his power to stop @entity1 from knocking at the door of that " common @entity69 home " by seeking to join the @entity152			1
even in the @entity154 , politicians liken events today in @entity6 to @entity16 's gobbling up of their countries in 1940			0
@entity158 has gone as far as to reassure the @entity154 republics -- which have sizeable @entity80 speaking minorities -- that as members of @entity162 they will be secure			2
but the alarm at unfolding events is palpable -- in @entity165 , @entity166 and other western capitals			0
@entity158 chancellor @entity168 said @entity80 was taking advantage of @entity1 's weakness			1
that is how wars began in the 19th and 20th centuries , she said , " which we thought we had overcome			0
" historical ring in @entity80 warning @entity135 -- buoyed by rocketing approval ratings at home -- seems unmoved by @entity19 threats of what @entity168 called " massive political and economic consequences " for @entity80 should it absorb @entity6			1
what those consequences will be remains unclear , but they seem likely to begin with visa restrictions and the freezing of foreign assets held by the new @entity189 leadership and its supporters in @entity6			0
the justification would be that they have illegally and unconstitutionally taken over part of a sovereign country			0
should @entity80 go ahead and annex @entity6 , sanctions would likely be extended to prominent @entity80			1
but the @entity80 military exercises close to @entity1 's eastern border over the past few days may be designed to warn that consequences will in turn have consequences			2
on friday , the @entity201 issued a stark warning about unrest in eastern @entity1 , where @entity80 speakers make up about half the population			2
after @entity1 and @entity189 protesters clashed in @entity207 on thursday , reportedly leaving two dead , @entity95 said it had repeatedly warned the new government in @entity87 that it must " disarm the militants , provide security for the population and legal rights for people during demonstrations			0
" the @entity216 statement went on : " @entity80 acknowledges its responsibility for the lives of its compatriots and fellow citizens in @entity1 and reserves the right to take these people under its protection			2
" that too has an historical ring			0
seventy - five years ago , on march 15 , 1939 , @entity226 ordered the @entity227 into the @entity228 , a @entity158 - speaking part of @entity230			0
his justification was simple : " i am simply demanding that the oppression of three and a half million @entity158 in @entity230 cease and that the inalienable right to self - determination take its place			2

70 years after " @entity25 " debates future of @entity24 at @entity20 , @entity6 is again at heart of argument
arguments over sovereignty , self - determination and influence are suddenly electric again
many @entity1 think @entity135 wants to expand @entity80 to the old borders of the @entity17
@entity135 -- buoyed by rocketing approval ratings at home -- seems unmoved by @entity19 threats
