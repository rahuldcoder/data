@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 says she will never understand why a group of teenage boys beat her fiancé to death			1
she says she will spend the rest of her life seeking answers -- and justice -- for the man she has lost as she struggles alone to raise her three young children			1
" my life is forever destroyed , " said @entity3 , who was 24 at the time of her fiancé 's death			1
" my family is forever destroyed			1
" her fiancé , @entity19 , an undocumented @entity20 immigrant , was walking down the street in @entity0 , @entity1 , on july 12 , 2008 , with @entity3 's half - sister , who is white			1
a fight broke out between him and a group of white high school football players			1
he died from his injuries two days later , leaving a small community stunned at the brutality of the crime			1
a central issue in the case is race in a town with a reputation for being an ethnic melting pot. witness @entity36 said she heard the group call @entity19 a " spic			1
" one of the boys who was charged as a juvenile , @entity39 , admitted telling @entity19 to " go home , you @entity20 motherf --- er. " residents speak out about the crime , racial overtones @entity39 was charged with ethnic intimidation			1
another teen pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations in a plea deal			1
but two teens who faced a local jury were acquitted of charges of ethnic intimidation			1
@entity3 does n't doubt that the attack was racially motivated			1
" they said some racist remarks to him , " @entity3 said of the teens			1
" truly , in my heart , i believe they beat him up because he was @entity61			1
" many in @entity0 deny that race played a role and say it was just a street fight gone wrong			1
the young men involved were ordinary high school students -- good kids , according to their families , friends and coaches			1
@entity0 resident interrupts @entity2 interview it took almost two weeks for arrests to be made			1
but on july 25 , @entity74 , 17 , and @entity75 , 16 , were charged as adults with homicide and ethnic intimidation			2
@entity79 , 18 , was charged as an adult with aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation			2
@entity82 , who admitted throwing a punch that left @entity84 , got straight a 's in school and ran track			2
his father says he was never a troublemaker			2
see photos of key figures in the case but how do ordinary kids get caught up in such a brutal incident ? experts say everyone has biases , and violent instincts are common , especially in young adults			2
young offenders " hate is part of our culture , " said @entity101 of the @entity102 at @entity103			1
" it transcends generations , it 's widely shared , and it 's learned from an early age , " @entity101 said			2
" even otherwise decent , honorable people can be pulled into it			2
" @entity114 of @entity103 's @entity115 said , " we all carry around biases with us , and it 's not the extraordinary monster that decides to act on it			2
generally speaking , it 's someone more like us and our children than a member of the [ @entity124			2
" research conducted by both @entity101 and @entity114 shows that there are three major types of hate crime offenders : " @entity129 " who look for excitement and power in attacking a person they perceive as different			2
" @entity135 " who seek revenge for a real or perceived crime against someone similar to the attacker			2
" defenders " who are trying to protect their neighborhood or way of life			2
perhaps the most expected type is also the rarest : an offender who may be a member of a group like the @entity124 and has a deep - seated hatred of a specific ethnic group			2
" hate criminals , most of them young men , believe they are carrying out the fervent , unspoken wishes of their communities , " said @entity151 , director of the @entity153 's @entity152			0
@entity114 says offenders often " believe other people share their biases ... everybody feels the way they do , or at least the majority			0
" by taking action , he says , they think " they 're being heroic while others are scared			0
" communities most likely to experience a hate crime have a " special combination of ethnic homogeneity and a rapid in - migration of groups perceived to be outsiders , " according to @entity174 , a professor at @entity175			0
he says a " flashpoint " can occur " when there 's a boundary - crossing			0
" for example , " an inter-ethnic , inter-sex relationship on public display			0
" offenders sense that an outside group is crossing a boundary , and when women are involved , it can trigger a defensive reaction , especially among young men			0
@entity0 's rich immigrant heritage has long been a source of pride in the former coal - mining town , and families have held tight to their cultural traditions for generations			1
but an influx of @entity198 in the late 1990s brought some discomfort			0
cheap housing and jobs in agriculture and construction drew undocumented immigrants -- among legal @entity61 residents and citizens -- to a community that was struggling economically			1
crimes against @entity198 rising @entity210 statistics show that @entity212 crimes are on the rise			0
there were 595 @entity212 crimes in 2007 , up almost 40 percent from the 426 crimes in 2003 ; the @entity61 population in @entity218 grew only 14 percent during that time			1
in december , @entity219 died after he was beaten with a baseball bat in @entity221 , @entity222			0
one month earlier , a group of seven teenagers with a history of harassing @entity198 went out looking for " @entity226 to f --- up " and fatally stabbed @entity229 immigrant @entity228 in @entity230 , @entity222			1
@entity210 figures from 2007 show that @entity212 attacks account for about 8 percent of all hate crimes			0
about 35 percent of hate crimes were directed at blacks , 16 percent at homosexuals and 13 percent at @entity237			0
but experts say hate crimes in general are underreported			0
states are not required to report those figures to the @entity210			0
and it can also be hard for law enforcement and prosecutors to prove that a perpetrator 's motive was hate , especially if a robbery occurs or the attacker had a prior relationship with the victim			0
often , the victims themselves -- especially @entity198 who may not be in the @entity218 legally -- do n't report the crimes and may mistrust the police			1
@entity114 says many victims may not realize or want to acknowledge that they have been the target of a hate crime			0
experts say communities can heal after hate crimes occur , and even prevent them from happening altogether , if local leaders take certain steps			0
" different people need to be welcomed , " @entity114 said			0
@entity174 says a community can portray change as positive , " saying , ' we 've got more great restaurants , more people who work hard , more people who are family - oriented , ' " for example			0
still struggling eventually , @entity75 was convicted of simple assault and consumption of alcohol , and @entity79 was convicted of simple assault , and three counts of corruption of a minor , providing alcohol to minors and consumption of alcohol			0
the jury acquitted @entity75 and @entity79 of ethnic intimidation charges			0
@entity75 was sentenced to between six and 23 months in prison and @entity79 from seven to 23 months			0
@entity82 pleaded guilty to violating @entity19 's civil rights			0
more than a year after @entity19 's death , @entity0 is still struggling			1
civil rights officials at the @entity290 are investigating the death and the actions of the @entity0 police officers who urged the boys to get their stories straight before talking to investigators			1
but there is no closure for @entity3			0
" it 's not done for me , " she said , " not by a long shot			0
that 's not justice at all			0
