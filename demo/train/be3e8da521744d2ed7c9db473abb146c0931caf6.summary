the originators of the @entity2 movement suggest protesters should retreat , as a new poll shows support for the movement flagging			1
in a random survey of 513 people conducted by the @entity9 , 83 % said pro-democracy protesters should cease their eight - week occupation of major roads in @entity13 , while just 13 % said the occupiers should continue			1
" given the backlash from the community , we have advised students to think of other forms of protest , instead of just focusing on occupations , " @entity2 co-founder @entity16 - man told @entity17			1
" the occupation is controversial ; it creates disturbance -- this is something we have to admit			1
we have to move to a new stage			0
" two - month blockade the protest has now blocked major roads around @entity13 nearly two months in an attempt to pressure officials into giving @entity13 open elections for its next leader			1
but neither the @entity36 or @entity13 governments have shown any willingness to compromise , and some protesters have grown agitated			1
yesterday , the movement took an unusually aggressive turn when masked protesters rammed barricades and hurled concrete slabs to smash through a glass door to @entity13 's @entity46 building -- where the city 's government meets			1
protesters also charged police lines , leading police to respond with pepper spray and batons			2
@entity54 were arrested , and the @entity13 government released a statement denouncing the protesters as " violent radicals			1
" pro-democracy legislator @entity59 , who tried unsuccessfully to stop the smashing , told @entity17 it was a " major setback " for the movement that has won widespread praise for its politeness and civility			2
" i understand they wanted to scale up the action , but they did n't understand that that would only destroy the campaign			0
" student leader @entity71 urged students to continue protesting nonviolently			2
" if we do not choose to give up , then there is still hope and we can choose to utilize different tactics , to explore ways to counter the government , " he said			0
uncertain future @entity13 's @entity79 has issued a series of injunctions authorizing police to begin clearing protest sites			1
a small section of the main protest site was cleared tuesday , and larger clearances are planned in the coming days			0
in the face of the impending action , protesters disagree over what should be done next			0
@entity16 and other protest leaders have proposed a " community education " campaign , in which democracy supporters would enter @entity13 neighborhoods to sway locals to their cause			1
another potential strategy is for the city 's pro-democracy legislators to resign en masse			0
this would trigger a by - election , giving @entity104 a chance to demonstrate their support for the democracy movement by voting the legislators back in			0
other hardline demonstrators advocate an escalation of the physical occupations -- though protest leaders discourage this			0
despite the uncertainty , the movement has already exceeded all expectations , said @entity16			2
" our original plan was people would just sit down , holding hands , and peacefully let police arrest us , " he said			0
" we expected our @entity2 movement would only last for a few days , not weeks or months			2
