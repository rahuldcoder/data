-- protests planned around @entity2 -- particularly in @entity4 's @entity3 -- on the second anniversary of the january 25 revolution are expected to be an explosion of dissent , revealing the deep divisions in the country between president @entity11 and the @entity2 people			1
opposition to @entity11 's authoritarianism is broader than the world recognizes			2
in making accommodations for @entity11 's government , the @entity16 is -- once again -- out of step with the @entity2 people			1
@entity2 may not know exactly what they want , but they know what they do n't want			2
although an effective political opposition has yet to coalesce , @entity2 from all sectors of society are united in their refusal to accept another repressive regime			2
@entity2 is on a collision course			2
an ever growing , if periodically discouraged , portion of the population opposes the government and @entity11 's @entity35 , and supports the revolution 's goals of social and economic justice , accountable government , and basic freedoms , including freedom of expression and protection of minorities			1
yet the government is moving in exactly the opposite direction , with its authoritarian control over political , social , and religious life			0
the government 's investigation of the wildly popular " @entity2 @entity51 " @entity52 -- charged with insulting @entity11 and undermining his command -- and the forced " retirement " of respected journalist @entity55 , editor of state - owned @entity58 's @entity57 - language website , are just two very public examples of the vice tightening on freedom of expression			1
in fact , the @entity63 says about 24 lawsuits for insulting @entity11 have been filed against journalists and activists since his election in june			2
the regime is trying to put the revolution genie back in the bottle			0
but it is clamping down on a population that has discovered its voice			0
in opposition to this repression , @entity2 at all levels are increasingly engaged in politics			0
a @entity4 cab driver -- ever the measure of popular sentiment -- recently debated the failings of the @entity83 with a passenger			0
after reaching the destination , the driver leapt out , grabbed a dogeared copy of the @entity83 he kept in the front seat , and pointed to a passage to prove his point to his passenger			0
the december demonstrations against president @entity11 and the @entity35 - backed @entity83 , which attracted an even broader segment of the population than those who stood in @entity3 in 2011 , revealed the broadening chasm between the regime and the people in @entity2			1
@entity100 outside the @entity101 were old and young , veiled and unveiled , rich and poor			0
whether they arrived in chauffeur - driven cars or whether they marched from @entity4 's outlying shantytowns , the hundreds of thousands joined together in their refusal to accept a state that squashed the dreams of the revolution and dictated political , social , and religious behavior			0
many call the second wave of the revolution in the fall of 2012 the " @entity114			0
" parents and grandparents went into the streets to protest the divided loyalties in their families between the @entity120 ( @entity35 or @entity121 ) and those supporting a democratic , secular @entity2			1
in @entity2 , secular means freedom from state control of religion , not nonreligious			2
the clash between these two visions of @entity2 -- secular with freedom and social justice , or a religious state run by the @entity35 with its version of @entity135 law -- played out inside families and on the streets			1
soldiers protecting the @entity101 during the december demonstrations were moved to tears when an @entity2 woman , referring to @entity11 , shouted at them , " why are you protecting this man who is pitting @entity2 against each other ? " @entity145 , a successful businessman who opposes @entity11 and spent much of december camping in @entity3 with the young revolutionaries , has experienced this division within families firsthand			1
a relative who had joined the @entity121 informed him that the extreme @entity152 group had put @entity145 at no. 5 on its " hit list , " which is widely believed by @entity2 to exist			0
the relative was unapologetic until @entity145 told him that he might as well put @entity145 's mother on the list , too , since the octogenarian also had joined the street protests			0
@entity2 and its families may be divided , but on one subject , all are united -- in the belief that the @entity16 is supporting the @entity35 - dominated government			1
visible in the throngs at the december demonstrations were signs opposing @entity166 and the @entity16 -- yes , the @entity16 and @entity166 were lumped together as supporters of the @entity35 regime			1
" this is such a historic opportunity to restore the image of the @entity16 , but instead it is putting itself in the same position as @entity166			0
... and this from president @entity177 -- so disappointing , " @entity173 , a professor at @entity174 , said , reflecting views heard repeatedly last december in @entity2			0
opposition leader and blogger @entity178 was even more blunt : " with the @entity83 in play , you are subsidizing an @entity152 state			0
" @entity178 said he was always pro- @entity16 " until the revolution			2
" in addition , the @entity184 plans to proceed with the delivery of 20 f - 16 jets to @entity2 , a step that looks to @entity2 like a vote of confidence in @entity11			1
unchanged since the revolution , @entity16 aid policy toward @entity2 still makes the military alliance its priority			1
two years after the @entity196 , the @entity16 government finds itself again backing an authoritarian regime against the popular will			2
as january 25 approaches , with massive protests planned against @entity11 's government , this is a precarious position for both the @entity16 and @entity2			1
in his second term , @entity177 should adopt a more agile and informed policy toward @entity2 , one that matches the words often heard from the @entity208 -- " the @entity16 always has stood with the @entity2 people " -- with action			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			0

national protests against @entity11 set for second anniversary of @entity2 's revolution
@entity213 : @entity16 out of step , *underestimates* the @entity221 sentiment
she says *proponents* of secular democracy think the @entity16 backs @entity35
she says massive protests will show @entity16 needs to align itself with the popular will
