-- my 65 - year - old father , @entity1 , was shot five times , knife in hand , as he wrestled with a domestic terrorist in the @entity7 of @entity8			1
the coward fled , leaving my father to pass away in a murmur of meditation			2
my father lived the @entity14 dream			1
starting with only a couple bucks in his pocket , he worked hard and long to make a life for his family and his community , helping to build the @entity21 temple where he was attacked			1
since that day , many discussions in our community have come and gone , with little attention from the majority of the national media or government			1
it seems many hard - earned lessons from this tragedy already have been forgotten			2
but they bear repeating and remembering			0
injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere			0
this attack was predicated on hate			0
too many hate groups exist right here in the @entity14 , and terror can take many forms : from school bullies to conservative radio hosts spreading fear and distortions to racists spewing hate			1
and , of course , to psychotic loners			0
violence has become part of @entity14 life			1
the @entity14 has the highest murder rate of affluent democracies			1
@entity14 had an extreme homicide rate of 5.4 per 100,000 people in 2008 - 2009 , compared with a 1.43 rate in @entity58 and @entity59 and a 1.3 rate in @entity61			1
the statistics differ somewhat every year , but the rate is always much higher in the @entity14 than in other affluent nations			1
@entity65 has less than a 10th of the @entity14 murder rate			1
since 1982 , @entity14 has seen at least 60 mass murders ( defined as at least four people being killed ) committed by guns			1
but violence does n't manifest only in the psychotic actions of a few			2
it seems to be part of the fabric of society , prevalent in entertainment and present in the " pre-emptive war " in @entity79 , waged on false information and funded by the @entity14 public			1
the coward -- i will never utter his name -- who so violated sacred ground and killed so many people was a product of a broken system			2
he spent six years in the armed forces , drank heavily and was a member of a white - power rock band			0
at some point , we must acknowledge and understand why this happens			0
in seems our system of education , our culture and our governance are failing somehow			0
president @entity100 , come to @entity101 on august 5 , the @entity14 dream was attacked			1
immigrants , whether naturalized -- like my father -- or not , have been treated as a second class for far too long			1
@entity108 - @entity14 and @entity109 immigrants shoulder the brunt of this sentiment			1
yet all people who are not caucasian and @entity113 most likely have felt this disregard , including african - americans , brought to this country against their own free will			0
conservatives who are anti-immigration add to the poison by denigrating foreigners more and more often			0
it is a sad and backward situation because immigrants are the lifeblood of this country , as @entity126 wrote so eloquently in his book , " @entity127			2
" " this was the secret of @entity14 : a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers ... , " @entity126 wrote			1
" every ethnic minority , in seeking its own freedom , helped strengthen the fabric of liberty in @entity14 life			1
similarly , every aspect of the @entity14 economy has profited from the contributions of immigrants			1
" this second - class status was further demonstrated when the national government and media seemed to lose interest in or concern about the shootings and the ensuing dialogue			1
maybe it was too much to take in after the massacre in a movie theater in @entity155 , @entity156			0
maybe this was not tragic enough to get prolonged attention			2
maybe politically , this is a powder keg			0
whatever the excuse , it is not good enough			0
@entity100 is coming to @entity101 , but she is not an elected official who is responsible for national policies that are at the core of this problem			0
on a sunday morning when devout @entity14 were getting ready for a sermon , they were slaughtered by a maniac who should have never been able to own a gun , given his history			1
no matter what was happening that week , it should have been top priority on any leader 's list to do something to acknowledge and help right this situation			2
the president should have made phone calls to representatives of the @entity21 community			2
the media should have sent their best and brightest to @entity8 to dissect the phenomenon of hate murders -- to its credit , @entity0 did			0
civil rights leaders would have done well to evaluate the nuances of the massacre , to shed light on their own causes			0
in turn , they would have gained an ally in the @entity21 community			2
if any of these things would have happened , maybe our discussion would turn to how to take action			0
how does " freedom " apply to hate speech , gun control , or the history of violence in @entity14 ? maybe @entity203 and @entity204 could unite on the issue of safety in our society			1
maybe political leaders would realize that when neighborhoods are safer , the economy benefits as more people and businesses move in			0
maybe immigrants would stand side by side to raise a unified voice in the upcoming elections -- seeking legitimate immigration reform			0
maybe it 's not too late			0
maybe these lessons are not lost			0
maybe those who laid down their lives did not do so in vain			0
i hope this is the case			0
