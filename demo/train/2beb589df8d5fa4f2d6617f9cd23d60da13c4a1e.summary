-- when the @entity2 officially opened in @entity2 on monday , much of the world press noted the irony of the world 's tallest building unveiled just weeks after the emirate 's debt crash			1
but a look at the history of record - breaking skyscrapers and business cycles suggests otherwise -- the opening of every single " world 's tallest " building in the past century has coincided with an economic downturn			1
one person who was n't surprised by the economic woes greeting the dedication of the @entity2 ( renamed monday from @entity2 in honor of the sheikh of @entity21 , which recently threw @entity2 a $ 10 billion lifeline ) was @entity24 economist @entity23			1
he predicted tough times for the emirate two years ago in a blog entitled " @entity28 ( and depression ? ) in the making			0
" he noted that economic depression or stock market collapse usually occurs prior to completion of such skyscrapers			1
" maybe the economic damage will be confined to the @entity41 , " he wrote in his post on august 7 , 2007 -- the summer in the @entity36 when subprime mortgage defaults started to rise , auguring the start of the @entity39			2
the opening of these epic edifices is a strikingly reliable indicator of a business downturn : * the 186 - meter singer building opened in @entity47 in the wake of the market panic of 1907			1
* @entity50 opened in 1931 , taking the mantle of world 's tallest building briefly held by 40 @entity54 and @entity55			1
all of these @entity47 buildings were conceived before the @entity57 , and opened after the @entity58 had begun			2
* the two towers of the @entity60 were opened in 1972 and 1973 , and the @entity61 ( since renamed @entity61 ) opened in 1974 -- when the @entity36 was mired in " stagflation " of growing unemployment and inflation			2
* @entity65 opened in 1998 in @entity66 , just as the @entity67 was sweeping through the region			0
this correlation was first noticed by market analyst @entity70 , who while based in @entity72 in the 1980s noticed the spate of building huge building projects in @entity75 just as its economic bubble burst			2
" it seemed strikingly similar to what happened during the building of the @entity81 in @entity47 , " he said			0
digging deeper , he found that long - running bull markets always preceded the building of these tall structures			0
in 1999 , @entity86 - based analyst @entity85 wrote a widely read research paper called " the @entity88 " which furthered the argument that super-tall buildings augur bad times			0
the index has been treated as a novelty indicator -- much like the @entity95 index ( if a team from the @entity100 division wins , @entity36 stock markets on average finish the year ahead ) , @entity23 said			0
but @entity23 argues in his 2005 research paper , " skyscrapers and @entity103 , " that the correlation is real : skyscrapers are a physical manifestation of the bull markets that build them			1
" it has all the components that are involved in a major boom or bust cycle , " @entity23 said			1
the components that give rise to the skyscrapers give rise to the boom : loose monetary policy and easy credit drive up land prices , " and people want to build higher to offset that , " he said			2
" you have easy credit and low interest rates fueling stock prices , and this creates an overly speculative market place			0
" @entity129 inflation and credit tends to increase the size of companies , who grow from local , regional to an international presence " -- creating both the wealth to build and the customer demand , @entity23 said			0
and , of course , rising wealth inflates egos			0
" there is an issue of vanity -- people want to build something a little higher , and ( customers ) want to locate in those prestigious places , " @entity23 said			0
" it definitely improves the value of your business card			0
" the skyscraper correlation is " has a very polarizing effect on people " in the tall building industry , said @entity154 , a partner with @entity155 international and co-chair of economics committee of the @entity159 , the international body which officially ranks the world 's highest structures			1
" it annoys a lot of people , but i personally think that the economics the theory is based on is sound , " he said			0
however , @entity154 points out that the economic life of iconic structures outlasts the boom times that created them and the bust that follows			1
" compared to a 10 - story office block , which probably has a life cycle of 20 years , some of these towers have lifecycles of 70 years or more , " he said			2
the past decade since the completion of the @entity65 " has been a period of time for unprecedented success of tall buildings , " he said , but with the ribbon - cutting of the @entity2 and the economic downturn , he believes the go - go times in the high - rise race are over -- for now			1
" my personal view is it will be a while before you 'll see any other building built that beats the @entity2 , " he said			1
if the skyscraper effect is true , that could be good news for the world economy .			0

the opening of every single " world 's tallest " building in the past century has coincided with an economic downturn
the @entity2 opened just weeks after @entity2 had to receive a $ 10 billion *bailout*
some researchers say skyscrapers are a physical manifestation of a boom and bust cycle in business
