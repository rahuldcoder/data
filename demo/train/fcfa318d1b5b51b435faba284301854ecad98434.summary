-- @entity1 will become the oldest @entity3 captain in golf history when he takes charge of the @entity7 team for the 2014 contest in @entity9 -- a country that has played host to some of his greatest successes			1
the eight - time major winner will be 65 when the event gets underway at @entity17			2
he is the last @entity7 captain to have won on @entity20 soil , triumphing at the @entity22 course in @entity23 in 1993			1
" i was waiting for about 20 years to get the call , " the 63 - year - old said at his unveiling on thursday			1
" i loved it the first time			0
it 's just a great honor to be able to do it again			0
" the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) turned to the five - time @entity32 champion in a bid to overturn recent poor form in the @entity3 , with @entity35 having won five of the last six matches -- including at @entity38 last september			1
having turned professional in 1971 , @entity1 is a seasoned veteran of the golfing world whose experience and respect are expected to aid the struggling @entity7 team in two years ' time			1
the @entity7 has picked a new captain for recent @entity46 , which are held every two years , but the @entity30 said it wanted to try something different after losing seven of the last nine tournaments			1
" the pressure of playing in the @entity3 is greater or as great as in any event , " said @entity1 , who will replace @entity50 " my job is to help them deal with that pressure			1
i 've lived for that pressure and lived underneath that pressure all my career			0
" one of the most popular figures on the golfing stage , the revered @entity1 tried to play down the gulf in age between his players and himself at the @entity65 conference			1
the previous oldest @entity7 captain was the legendary @entity67 , who was 57 when he oversaw his nation 's retention of the trophy in 1969 -- made famous by @entity72 ' concession of a match - equaling putt to @entity75			1
" i deflect that very simply by saying , ' we play the same game , ' " @entity1 said			2
" i hope i can set the table for these players			0
i 'm the stage manager			0
i set the stage for them to go out and do what they do			0
in two years , i hope they can get it done			0
" @entity1 's relationship with @entity88 will come under intense scrutiny , having criticized the 14 - time major winner 's behavior on and off the course following his fall from grace in 2009			1
nonetheless , @entity88 was one of the first to offer both his support for @entity1 and availability for the tournament			2
" i would like to congratulate @entity1 on his selection as @entity3 captain , " @entity88 said in a statement			1
" i think he 's a really good choice			0
@entity1 knows what it takes to win and that 's our ultimate goal			2
i hope i have the privilege of joining him on the 2014 @entity7 team			1
" @entity1 swiftly dampened the sparks of any potential controversy about @entity88 by stating that he would pick the former world number one in his squad whether or not he qualifies for one of the eight automatic places on offer			2
the captain also has four discretionary choices			0
" i want him on my team , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity88 is maybe the best player in history			0
if he 's not on the team , he 's going to be number one in my picks			0
" @entity1 , the first @entity7 captain to return to the helm since @entity72 lost on home soil in 1987 , also received the backing of @entity130 -- like @entity88 , a member of this year 's unsuccessful side in @entity132			1
" obviously they were looking outside the box , given our recent failures , " @entity130 told the @entity134 website			0
" they wanted to get a guy who has had success and commands respect			0
i think that 's why they went this way : to get the @entity7 to rally around him as a way to rejuvenate the @entity7 side			2
" @entity1 is one of the best competitors of all time			2
he 's going to bring that fire and unwillingness to lose and mental strength that has defined his career			0
" at the @entity154 , @entity1 missed a par putt on the 72nd hole at @entity157 that would have made him the oldest major champion in the history of the sport			1
the @entity7 has a warm relationship with @entity9 , the country where he won his first major title at @entity163 in 1975 and where he would eventually win half his major crowns			1
his appointment was announced by the @entity30 on nationwide television , with predecessor @entity167 having relinquished his post after what was dubbed the " meltdown in @entity38 " in the @entity7 but the " @entity171 " in @entity20			0
" we 've got the right guy , " rallied @entity30 president @entity172 .			0
