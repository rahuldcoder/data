are you lonely ? bored ? trying to deflect questions about that special someone from @entity4 , @entity5 or your friends because there 's nobody romantic in your life ? maybe you need an @entity12			1
yes , the @entity13 has a solution for everything , and @entity12 ( or girlfriend , they 're not fussy ) can take care of those pesky privacy - invading questions by supplying an actual person to call you , text you and leave you messages			1
they 'll even send you handwritten notes			1
why , that 's sometimes better than an @entity27 ! @entity28 , who describes himself as a " recovering lawyer " with " idea surplus disorder , " came up with the idea several years ago after a divorce and bought the domain @entity34 for $ 7			1
he filed it away until late 2013 , when he pitched it to a @entity38 hackathon			2
a long weekend later , he and his team won the contest			2
that probably would have been it except for @entity43 , which picked up the story from a local alternative newspaper			0
suddenly @entity28 -- who already had a full - time job running his company , an innovation - strategy firm called @entity49 -- realized that , thanks to the attention , @entity12 had better be good			1
the result is a web service , launching in beta this week , that allows you to invent your potential partner			2
for $ 24.99 a month ( for starters , which includes 100 text messages , voicemail and handwritten notes ) , you get to make up a story about how you met ( the homepage includes a nice @entity65 - style paragraph ) and pick out an image , name , age and interests			1
who 's at the other end ? though @entity28 says some of that information is proprietary , he 'll allow that the @entity38 - based company has partnered with a service that has real people responding to your messages			1
( yes , they 've been trained , so watch your language			0
) " there has grown this amazing multinational workforce of people willing to do microtasks for a very small amount of money , " he says			0
not even he knows where they 're all located , but he expects that the work will be scalable with demand			0
a @entity91 writer observed that her @entity12 came from the city she requested , based on area code , and she praised the " attention to detail			1
" eventually , @entity12 expects to offer gifts sent to you at work and other real - life services , says @entity28			1
not even @entity100 had it so good			0
ideas like @entity12 have been fodder for generations of stories , of course			1
think of " @entity107 , " who supplies poetry to the lunkheaded @entity110 to woo @entity111 ; or the movie " her , " in which @entity115 's sad sack falls in love with a computer operating system			0
what lonely person would n't like someone understanding to talk to , even if just through a device ? @entity28 admits he 's thought about it			2
" there 's a very real possibility that people might grow attached , though that 's not what we 're trying to go for here , " he says			0
but he believes his service can be useful to build customers ' confidence			2
" we had a user who was at dinner on a date			0
his text message went off , he texted her back , and all of a sudden the woman across the table from him asked who it was , " he says			2
the real - life date , he says , was n't upset at all , but became more intrigued			0
" what we 're seeing is potential user cases are all over the board , " @entity28 says			0
" it 's not just , i want to convince my parents i 'm in a relationship			0
