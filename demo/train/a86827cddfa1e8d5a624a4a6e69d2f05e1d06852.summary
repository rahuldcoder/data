-- @entity1 took to @entity2 last night to ask @entity4 viewers to watch her cable network own , drawing criticism from some followers and investigative scrutiny from the ratings measurement company			1
" every 1 who can please turn to own especially if u have a @entity4 box , " she tweeted sunday evening at the start " @entity13 " and the mega-rated @entity12 telecast			1
she later added , " @entity12 people			2
. u can turn to @entity18			2
" that tweets caused a backlash on the social networking site , with readers accusing her of " begging for viewers " and being " desperate			1
" @entity1 followed up with a flurry of defensive replies that were apparently in response to reader criticism : " the word ' please ' is used as courtesy not a beg ... ' desperate ' not ever a part of my vocab ... ' unethical ' a little harsh do n't u think ? seemed like it made sense to me			1
sorry if u 're offended			2
" the original tweet has since been deleted			0
as @entity38 noted , networks are not allowed to specifically target @entity4 subscribers			1
it 's policy prohibits " attempts to single out panel members ... to change their viewing habits			0
" " in accordance with our policies and procedures , @entity4 is reviewing this incident with our clients and we may withhold , breakout and / or make a note in the ratings , " a @entity4 rep told @entity0			2
" we take any violation of our policy seriously and will work with clients to resolve the situation			0
" of course , given that 39.9 million people watched the @entity61 last night , with @entity62 crushing rivals , a more effective punishment might be releasing @entity18 's ratings instead of holding them back			0
update : @entity1 released this statement : " i removed the tweet at the request of @entity4			1
i intended no harm and apologize for the reference			0
