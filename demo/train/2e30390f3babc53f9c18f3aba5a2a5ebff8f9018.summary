@entity0 -- it was about time			0
it was about time for @entity1 to broadcast a regular series on @entity5 -- a deeper , intelligent look from inside the country itself			1
and the interest is out there			0
anyone who watched the second @entity13 presidential debate this week between incumbent @entity14 and @entity15 saw the @entity5 sparks fly both on air and online			1
so much so , @entity19 's government and politics team pointed out that president @entity14 's barb to @entity15 , " you 're the last person to get tough on @entity5 , " generated some 198,619 tweets per minute			2
it was the second-most tweeted moment of the debate			0
more : full show times there 's been so much chatter about the @entity5 trade advantage and even a so - called @entity5 century			1
but on major @entity32 tv news networks , there 's been no regular programming on @entity5 politics , industry and society			2
from " @entity39 " to " @entity40 , " the @entity13 has itself well covered with programming recorded from inside the @entity38			1
but what about a regular series on @entity5 broadcast from inside @entity5 's borders ? " on @entity5 " is a new monthly show shot on location at the historic @entity46 in @entity0			1
in each 30 - minute episode , i sit down with thought leaders from @entity5 as well as astute observers of this world power for a roundtable discussion about what 's really driving the country			1
the topic may change month to month , but the goal will be the same -- to engage , inform , and ultimately narrow the gulf of misunderstanding about @entity5			2
there are no quick - edit sound bites			1
just straight - up analysis and insight from some of the strongest @entity5 watchers out there			1
for the first episode , three unique voices joined me for a focus on the @entity72 ahead of @entity5 's rare leadership transition			2
they included leading publisher and influential blogger @entity76 , former top official in the @entity78 ( and @entity80 interpreter for the @entity81 ) @entity82 , and award - winning journalist and @entity5 commentator @entity84			1
on the structure of the @entity72 , @entity76 likened it to a company			0
" it 's like a corporation , " she told me			0
" the board as the @entity94 names the ceo , and then you have middle management which are the ministers and the various commissions , directors and so on			0
so , for me , it 's really like a corporate town			0
" as for how @entity103 rose to the top as @entity5 's presumed next president , @entity82 pointed to @entity103 's political pedigree as well as his military links			2
" he had a very unique career path , " said @entity82			0
" he literally has experience in four provinces and cities -- @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 -- in addition to his extraordinary experience at the @entity119			0
" " in addition to that , when he was in a civilian position , mr. @entity103 has kept his associations with the @entity5 military through various ways -- serving in the reserved forces and taking up leadership of the provincial garrison			2
that sets him apart from all all the current civilian leaders in @entity5			1
" @entity84 said @entity82 's points about @entity103 's ties to the military are significant , as they have been largely ignored by the @entity32 media			0
@entity84 also said @entity103 will come to power at a time of remarkable instability for the party			0
" we 're entering a new period of uncharted waters , where @entity5 's facing an enormous amount of challenges -- challenges from very charismatic and populist figures like @entity145 , challenges from the bottom up from people demanding more predictability in their lives , a legal system that will protect their property , a good school for their kids , clean food for their children and clean air to breathe			1
" how the new leadership manages the party 's political fractures and the people 's growing demands will be a gripping drama to watch unfold in the years ahead ... and to cover on @entity1 's " on @entity5			0

@entity5 and its so - called trade advantage has even *dominated* the @entity13 presidential debate
@entity168 : ' on @entity5 ' will provide " a deeper , intelligent look from inside the country itself "
monthly show will feature thought leaders and astute observers of this world power
@entity168 : " there are no quick - edit sound bites . no populist posturing . no swooshes "
