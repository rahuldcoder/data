@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 fighter jets pounded @entity5 targets in the country 's northwestern region tuesday , part of a wider military crackdown on militants inside its borders			1
a @entity1 army gunship flies over the troubled @entity13 on monday			1
the airstrikes killed between 70 and 75 militants in the @entity13 district and flushed out many more , military spokesman gen. @entity14 told reporters			2
it is part of the @entity1 army 's intensified drive against the @entity5 in its restive tribal regions			2
the @entity1 government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with @entity26			1
as a result , the @entity28 military has carried out drone attacks against militant targets in @entity1 , rankling @entity1			2
but @entity1 's recent military crackdown has led to an exodus of civilians in the region			2
between 15,000 and 30,000 residents have left the @entity37 , which is less than 160 km ( 100 miles ) northwest of the capital , @entity0 , according to an aid agency operating in the region			0
the @entity1 military on tuesday completed its operation to eliminate and expel militants in @entity13 and is now focusing on the @entity45 district , @entity14 said			1
about 300 militants entered @entity45 a few days ago in violation of the @entity5 's recent agreement to leave the district , he said			2
@entity45 is about 60 miles away from @entity0 , but @entity14 said the militants posed no threat to the capital city			0
fighter jets pounded targets in @entity45 and the @entity55 in an effort to block the militants ' entry and exit points , he added			0
the general also released a recording of what he said was a conversation between a regional @entity5 commander , @entity64 , and some of his lieutenants			1
on the call , the purported @entity5 leaders discuss how to stage an announced retreat from @entity45 last weekend while remaining in control of the territory			1
" those who will remain there will stay apart , so that the world gets to know that @entity5 have left @entity45 , " one of the commanders says , according to the transcript			2
" not more than two @entity5 should sit on a vehicle			0
" showing off for news organizations " is all right , but we have to implement a permanent plan , " @entity64 said			0
@entity1 's government insists that its military crackdown has growing popular support for taking on the @entity5 -- an issue that has divided the @entity1 people , particularly in the @entity88 areas			1
" the government has been hesitant and divided in going after these guys , but public opinion -- judging by what i read in the @entity1 newspapers -- may be shifting , " analyst @entity89 told @entity2			0
" they have thought the @entity5 is @entity28 's war , " said @entity89 , a co-founder of the @entity96 , a @entity97 - based think tank			0
" we led them to that conclusion with our drone attacks on @entity1 soil			0
" but he warned that a @entity1 military operation against what is sometimes perceived as " going after its own people " will not be an easy task for the government			1
" the military will go into the field and reclaim territory , but it 's not going to be pretty and it 's not going to be easy , " he said			0
@entity116 's @entity115 director @entity114 told @entity2 he thinks the test for @entity1 's government is not a military defeat over the @entity5 , but " whether the schools will once again open , whether the health units will once again operate ( in @entity45 )			1
" he also warned that a @entity1 military operation could be worse than @entity5 rule in @entity45 and other regions			1
" what people are telling us over and over again from @entity45 , from @entity55 , and other areas , is that they 're very intimidated , very scared about life under the @entity5 , " @entity114 said			0
" but what really frightens them is the idea that the @entity1 military will launch operations			1
" he said that local residents have told @entity116 in recent months that @entity1 military operations have " destroyed houses , destroyed markets , without in any way impacting the @entity5			1
" " and that 's what really frightens people , " he said			0
" we 've seen over 500,000 people are now registered as displaced from areas and most of those are people who are afraid of military operations			0
" @entity2 's @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
