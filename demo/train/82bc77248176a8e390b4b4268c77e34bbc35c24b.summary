@entity0 , @entity1 -- the crowd cheers as the stars make their way to the ring for first pro-wrestling bout @entity1 has seen in almost 20 years			1
back then , we 're told the spectators thought the action was real			0
now , they 're more savvy , and appreciative , clapping loudly as the former @entity12 stars execute their maneuvers during the two - day contest in @entity0			2
" we 're here to do something bigger and better , " pro-wrestler @entity15 roars backstage			0
he could also be alluding to the purpose of the trip , an attempt at " sports diplomacy " by @entity23 , a @entity18 former pro-wrestler turned politician			1
he 's organized the trip at a time of thawing relations between @entity18 and @entity1 over the issue of abductions of @entity18 citizens in the 1970s and ' 80s			1
recent talks opened the door for further investigations by @entity1 and a report is expected in the next few weeks			1
the behind - the - scenes diplomacy is a long way from the public spectacles staged during this mixed martial arts festival			1
the stars of the show -- including former @entity44 star @entity42 " @entity45 -- join arm - wrestling and tug - of - war competitions with the @entity0 locals , some who seem more than a little bemused			2
tightly - controlled international media has joined the tightly - controlled tour , which took us from the birthplace of the nation 's founder , @entity54 , to the pet projects of its current leader , @entity57			1
a bus ride seemed to take us back in time as we passed fields where locals where working , tending the soil with their hands			0
our destination was a country club where , for the equivalent of $ 10 an hour , locals can ride horses in an indoor arena			1
it 's a past time only for @entity0 's elite			0
the country 's per capita income is estimated to be around $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 a year , putting such pursuits out of reach of most people			2
however , outside @entity0 there 's a place where anyone can see the country 's most impressive monuments , without having to visit each one			0
it 's a theme park that displays @entity1 's landmarks in miniature			1
many of them could be found in @entity0			0
indeed , visitors could even see the real - life @entity90 from the park			1
the original , built on the shore of the @entity95 , is named after the political ideology formed by the country 's @entity97 president @entity54 , that " man is the master of everything and decides everything			0
" then there 's the @entity103 and more lessons in @entity1 history			1
we were shown a video that shared the country 's perspective on the @entity110 ( 1950 - 53 )			1
it was started by an attack from @entity12 , the video declared			0
when i questioned this , the guide replied , " that 's what you 're taught			0
" @entity1 's military might and successes were paraded in other displays			1
we were shown a @entity124 research ship -- the @entity125 -- that was seized in 1968 for allegedly spying on the @entity1			2
@entity126 claims it never entered @entity1 waters			2
photos showing planes and helicopters that had crashed in @entity1 territory were also displayed , including a graphic image of a dead @entity12 soldier			2
asked why it was necessary to display the photo , the guide replied : " dead pilot ? because it shows that anybody who violates our sovereignty and intrudes on us to commit espionage must be killed like this			0
" pet projects since taking power after his father 's death in 2011 , @entity57 has sought to make his mark on the country and its population of some 25 million people			0
he 's launched a number of pet projects , spending millions on a new @entity153 and a slide - filled water park in @entity0 , which we 've seen firsthand during our trip			1
however , outside @entity0 it 's unclear how far the spending has spread			0
@entity1 remains a secretive state , accused by a @entity161 panel of widespread human rights abuses , charges that the country denies			1
minders have watched our every move , from the moment we landed in @entity0 to the bus ride to our hotel , which sits on its own island			2
the tour has followed pre-approved routes ; we 're shown what they want us to see			0
so far , that has been impressive infrastructure for a country that 's struggling to feed its own people , and that has erected an almost unassailable boundary between it and the outside world			0
@entity181 in @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

behind public spectacle , is an attempt at sports diplomacy
