@entity0 -- when a @entity4 employee unexpectedly wrote a scathing op - ed in the @entity6 in march 2012 about why he was leaving the investment bank , he painted a picture of a " toxic " workplace that embraced morally corrupt practices at the expense of their clients			1
@entity15 's reaction was n't rooted in damage control			1
instead , as the firm 's global head of human capital management -- overseeing more than 30,000 employees -- she wanted to know why			1
" it was to figure out why it was that there was an individual who worked at @entity4 who felt that the only way they could voice their experience was to write an op - ed in the @entity6 , " she recalls to @entity1 's @entity21			1
" we 've emerged from what was one of the most challenging periods of financial services history , and we 've come into a better , more normalized position ... we 've been able to take a step back and really think about the future , " says @entity36			1
as one of @entity40 's most sought after investment banks , named one of @entity44 's @entity43 to work for this year , @entity36 has led the human capital management department for the past six years and is responsible for recruiting the best and brightest talent for the firm			1
" we continue to be amazed by the extraordinary talents of this generation			2
and they ask really tough questions			2
as a result we 've got to stay on our toes			2
data drives performance to find the best candidates , she explains , @entity4 uses employee performance metrics			1
" value add is being able to mine all the data that 's out there			2
think about the people landscape right now ... we develop , we invest , we compensate thousands of people every year			2
how are we using that data to inform our decisions going forward ? " if you had asked me 30 years ago , ' would i be on the management committee at @entity4 and be the influence of our success through our people ? ' oh no way			1
and so , i think that i 've come to expect the unexpected , " she says			2
as one of the most powerful people on @entity40 , surprisingly @entity36 never planned for a career in finance			1
as a young woman , her ambition was to own her own clothing boutique in @entity0			2
to make her dream a reality , after graduating from @entity86 decided she needed to go to business school			0
she took a job at a @entity92 bank while attending business school at the same time at @entity95 's @entity94			0
three decades later , she 's still in finance and the clothing store is a fond but distant memory			0
broadening horizons looking back over her career , @entity36 credits much of her rise at @entity4 to her time spent working overseas in the firm 's @entity106 office			1
" i think in today 's economy , operating outside of your comfort zone is really , really important			0
i ca n't think of any industry where it 's not important to be able to take that risk of stepping forward into the unfamiliar			0
" she describes moving abroad as an " extraordinary experience " where she reveled in learning how to work with people from all over the world			0
with some 30,000 employees around the globe , the management skills she honed in @entity106 continue to help @entity36 in her role today			1
" i 'm responsible for them -- the good , the bad and the not so perfect , " says @entity36			1
" [ @entity127 ] need to make sure that we are continuing to be viewed as a terrific place to work			0
" @entity36 is also one of four women on @entity4 ' 29 - member executive committee			1
it 's a number she says needs to rise and notes diversity in all areas -- not just gender -- is key to success			0
" there are four women , but i also see that there 's other types of diversity as well and we need more of everything			0
" we ca n't be the great firm that we need to be , to be relevant to our clients , if we do n't have diversity at every level			1
" corporate confidants as she has risen up the ranks , @entity36 is well aware of the help she has received from peers along the way			1
she recalls when she joined the management committee and was pulled aside after the first monday morning meeting by the bank 's president and coo @entity160			1
" he said , ' you know what ? you did not represent what you do and what you know at the management committee this morning			2
going forward , every sunday ... we have a call -- you 're going to go through with me what you 're going to talk about			0
" had she failed ? had @entity4 made the wrong decision in promoting her ? these questions raced through @entity36 's mind			1
but in retrospect she says it was the guidance she needed			0
in the end , she had only two calls with @entity160			0
it was all she needed			0
" it meant that i was n't alone in the experience			0
" a lot of times , mentoring is listening and feeding back to people that they can actually figure it out but they just need the confidence boost to do that , " she explains			0
" i 'm successful because other people have gotten behind me			0
it 's my passion to be there for other people as well			0
" @entity1 's @entity21 contributed to this piece .			0
