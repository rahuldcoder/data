-- " life is good , i got ta be honest , " laughs @entity1			1
she 's in her apartment in @entity4 with her husband , @entity5			1
and who 's napping in his room ? their baby boy , @entity8			1
" i 'm in baby heaven , " says the @entity11 - born tv host and fashion designer , sounding surprisingly calm considering that one year ago , after four years of struggling to conceive , she got the devastating news that she had breast cancer			1
viewers of the couple 's hit @entity19 show " @entity21 " know the story well : @entity1 went through three @entity22 ( one she miscarried ; one did n't take ) , and then , at 36 , was diagnosed with cancer			1
she had a double mastectomy			2
unable to carry the embryos from her third @entity22 ( due to her cancer medication ) , she enlisted a gestational surrogate , who gave birth to their son on august 29			1
come november , after a few months of baby - bonding , it 's back to work			1
on november 12 , @entity1 will return to " @entity35 news " with a new co-anchor , @entity37			1
in addition to her co-hosting gig on @entity35 's @entity40 , she has just launched her g by @entity1 collection on @entity43 , and will host @entity45 's spring show @entity46 with @entity5			1
now , she tells health what she 's learned about staying positive when your world turns upside down			1
health : congratulations on @entity53 ! what 's your favorite thing about him ? @entity1 : i love when i feed him in the middle of the night			1
those moments are incredible , when it 's so quiet and there 's just a little bit of a light on , just looking at his little face			1
health : the road to baby was a tough one for you			2
you 've said you were blindsided by how difficult it was			2
@entity1 : it was a big shock ! i always say how i chased my career instead of chasing guys			1
and everybody was patting me on the back			2
no one ever told me , " oh , by the way , your eggs change when you reach a certain age			2
" i did n't think 35 was old ! so when the doctor said , " it 's not as easy as you thought it would be , " it was a real blow			1
because i felt so young			0
i mean , this is a girl who was running six miles a day , and eating healthy , so how can you tell me that i 'm not healthy in that department ? @entity0 : a top doc reveals 8 fertility misconceptions health : so would you have done anything differently ? @entity1 : i do n't think i would 've frozen my eggs			1
a lot of people throw that out there , like , " oh , just freeze your eggs			0
it 's surgery ! as a 25 - year - old making not a lot of money , you 're not just going to go through all that and freeze your eggs			1
health : were you ever frustrated to see other women getting pregnant ? @entity1 : my first ivf i did get pregnant — that was the miscarriage			1
but the second one , i did not get pregnant , and that was the biggest kick in the stomach , because i just could not believe you go through so much to get those eggs and put them in , and when the doctor calls you , to hear , " oh , sorry , it did n't work			2
" that was the most shocking			0
i would go , " i 'm a good person , and i could give someone the greatest life of all , but yet i ca n't get pregnant			1
" and then you watch these tv shows , " 16 and pregnant , " and these girls who want nothing to do with their babies are pregnant			2
and you 're going , what ? none of that made sense to me			0
health : had you known what was coming , would you have chosen to keep any of this private ? @entity1 : had you given me a crystal ball when we were signing on to do the reality show that said , " this is what 's coming up , do you want to do it ? " i would 've said absolutely not			1
you could n't pay me enough			2
but , looking back , i 'm so happy that i did do it			0
as i would question @entity145 , " why are you doing this to me , why me ? " i think @entity145 knew i was a loud - mouthed @entity11 girl who would get out and share my story , not tuck it under a rug			2
@entity0 : are fertility drugs safe ? health : after finding your cancer , did you know what your next steps would be ? @entity1 : no way , are you kidding ? i was shell - shocked			1
i thought i was going to die			0
i did n't know that if you find breast cancer early enough , you have a 98 percent survival rate			1
i went to work right after finding out and did @entity35 ! news			0
i recently watched that episode and i do n't know how i pulled it off			2
afterward , i ran into my dressing room and started hysterically crying			0
@entity5 was really the one who had to pick me up off the floor and say , " hey , we 're making a plan here			0
health : you seem to display such grace under pressure			0
what is your secret ? @entity1 : focus on the positive			1
whenever i was so sad , when i was on the floor kicking and screaming and crying , the best way i could pull out of it was when i would remind myself : even with this happening , you 're still better off than a lot of people			0
for me , it was saying , " yes , i have breast cancer			2
yes , i had to have a double mastectomy			0
" but , you know what ? thank @entity145 i 'm going to a good doctor			2
i 'm so fortunate i found it early			0
i 'm so fortunate to have @entity5			0
i 'm so fortunate that i have a boss who understands			0
health : what is your cancer prognosis right now ? @entity1 : as of this week , i 'm a one - year survivor ! i get checked every three months , and i 'm looking good			1
@entity0 : 25 breast cancer myths busted health : where do you feel your absolute happiest ? @entity1 : taking a long walk on the lakefront of @entity4 with my husband and my baby boy			1
@entity199 answers your questions what is the best way to support a friend after a miscarriage ? — @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 @entity1 : if you have n't been through a miscarriage , just listen			1
do n't say , " it 's going to be ok			1
" just give your friend a shoulder to cry on , and say , " i can only imagine what you 're going through			0
" and , " you have every right to feel sad			0
" let her talk , let her cry , and let her just be			0
it was very difficult [ for me ] when people were telling me , " next time you 'll get pregnant			0
" well , how do you know that ? it just made me angry			0
" @entity0 : pregnancy advice examined what made you decide to go with a surrogate versus adoption ? — @entity228 , @entity229 @entity1 : adoption was something we were very open to , but when we did the third @entity22 , we got the embryos and i would have put them into myself , but that was when we found the breast cancer			1
part of the treatment is five years of tamoxifen , which can cause birth defects			0
so we said , " dr. @entity240 , what now ? " he said the next step should be surrogacy because we had the embryos			0
as @entity5 likes to say , they were " on ice			0
" so we met this lovely @entity248 girl who was living in @entity249 and she carried our baby for nine flawless months			2
we are still open to adoption if we decide to have more kids			0
but we do still have some embryos on ice , so if we wanted to try surrogacy again , we could			0
how can you best help a friend who has cancer ? — @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 @entity1 : if you call and say , " can i do anything for you ? " nine out of 10 times , do you know what they 're going to say ? " no , no , i 'm ok			1
" when you are going through cancer , you feel out of control , so you overcompensate			2
so basically , you insist			0
call and say , " while you have your doctor 's appointment , do you mind if i come watch your kids ? " or , " i 'm just going to drop off groceries ; you do n't even have to come to the door			1
" as a breast cancer survivor , i hated the ordeal , but i 'm ultimately glad i had cancer , as it shifted my priorities			2
were there any good parts for you ? — @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 @entity1 : if i could erase all this , i would			1
but i ca n't , so i look at the positive			2
it made me a stronger and a better person			0
it definitely shifted my priorities			0
but i still love my career			0
i so love fashion and makeup and designing			0
