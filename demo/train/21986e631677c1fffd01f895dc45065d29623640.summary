@entity0 -- the legal battle being fought by former @entity4 president @entity3 under charges including being complicit in the killing of protestors will sustain a climate of uncertainty for the country 's president @entity10			1
the @entity13 's most populous country is struggling to stabilize 27 months after the uprising that toppled @entity3			1
the economic squeeze is on			0
unemployment and the budget deficit are in the double digits			0
in this climate , it is nearly impossible for the relatively new president to sign on to cuts in fuel and food subsidies called for in @entity26 negotiations over a bailout			1
those negotiations have lasted nearly a year and the two parties put out a joint statement after talks during the @entity26 - @entity33 spring meetings this weekend			1
" the authorities are firmly committed to addressing @entity4 's economic and financial challenges with the objective of restoring sustained and socially - balanced growth , and they are already taking encouraging actions in this direction , " they said , after bi-lateral discussions			1
but one could read that as holding tactic , allowing the @entity10 administration to buy more time			1
@entity46 has some breathing room thanks to a cash injection by @entity49 , which recently signed over $ 3 billion in emergency funding			0
other money from the oil rich @entity52 have been either pledged or delivered by @entity54 and the @entity55			0
foreign investors like to tick boxes on their check list when sizing up opportunities or measuring risks			0
that list usually includes : a consistent legal system ; rule of law covering foreign investment , ample foreign exchange reserves and a stable currency ; a sizable market with better than average economic growth			0
@entity4 has one tick : it 's a big market with nearly 90 million consumers			1
other items on the list , which both investors and ratings agencies want , are not in place			1
after three decades as an underground opposition movement under the banner of the @entity80 , the @entity77 is finding it difficult to govern			0
@entity82 : ' oceans of garbage ' the army commander of armed forces @entity84 has suggested the country 's instability could collapse the state			2
president @entity10 then suggested this may eventually require the implementation of extraordinary measures to maintain control			1
during a recent interview in @entity0 , opposition leader and @entity96 laureate @entity95 told me : " everybody wants to protect the nation , not only mr @entity10			2
" he then added : " but the solution is not a military one , not a security one , it is a political one			0
" @entity95 is urging a post-apartheid type commission for reconciliation which would help " unite political @entity105 with the rest of the country			2
" this , he believes , will help pave the way for economic stability			0
a month ago , when @entity112 's cut @entity4 sovereign credit rating for a sixth time , the agency said there was a 40 % chance of default in the next five years			2
foreign reserves have tumbled over 60 % in two years and provide a financial cushion of just three months			0
that is where the @entity26 loan of $ 4.8 billion comes into play			2
if an agreement can be reached by june , as some are suggesting , then another $ 10 billion from the @entity124 and regional donors could be unlocked			0
in the meantime , uncertainty brought on by the court cases of the former president and the political challenges against the current one may well keep global investors at bay .			1

@entity4 's climate of uncertainty is making leadership difficult for president @entity10
negotiations over a bailout from the @entity26 have already lasted a year , and are in a holding pattern
investors and ratings agencies want @entity4 to deliver more stability , but the country is still struggling
charges against the former president and political challenges against @entity10 are *problematic*
