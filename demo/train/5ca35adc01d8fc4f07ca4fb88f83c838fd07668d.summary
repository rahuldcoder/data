a @entity1 fishing boat has sunk after colliding with a @entity3 vessel near an island chain in the @entity5 at the center of a territorial dispute between the two @entity9 neighbors			1
according to @entity3 's state - run @entity11 news agency , the @entity1 vessel had been " harassing " a @entity3 fishing boat at 5 p.m. local time on monday in waters near the @entity15 , a largely uninhabited archipelago also known by the @entity3 as the @entity15			1
however , @entity17 , a senior officer aboard a @entity1 coast guard boat patrolling waters nearby , told @entity19 tuesday the @entity1 vessel reported that it had actually been rammed by the @entity3 ship during a distress call			1

" other @entity1 fishing boats and coast guard ships picked up the 10 crew members aboard the @entity1 vessel , @entity17 added			1
@entity3 ships reach @entity1 to extract thousands of citizens ' forcefully intruded ' relations between @entity3 and @entity1 have soured in recent weeks after a state - owned @entity3 oil company began drilling for oil some 17 nautical miles off the @entity15			1
@entity1 officials say @entity3 military and civilian ships have been harassing their vessels around the islands -- which are controlled by @entity41 but claimed by @entity42 -- even accusing the @entity3 of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon			2

at a daily press briefing in @entity41 tuesday , @entity3 @entity47 spokesman @entity46 said the @entity1 vessel had " forcefully intruded " into the area where its drilling rig was operating , then ran into the left side of a @entity3 fishing boat before capsizing			1
" i want to stress that the direct cause for this incident is that the @entity1 side ... insisted on disturbing the normal operation by the @entity3 side and took dangerous action on the sea , " said @entity46			2
" we once again urge the @entity1 side to stop immediately all kinds of disruptive and damaging activities			0
" he said there is " no dispute concerning the sovereignty of the @entity15 islands , " and that they are @entity3 territory			0
" we hope the @entity1 side will stop its disruptive actions and bear in mind the overall interests of the stability of the region			0
only by doing so can the @entity1 side uphold the overall interests of bilateral relationship , " @entity46 added			0
the spat recently spilled into violent @entity81 protests across @entity1 two weeks ago , prompting @entity41 to evacuate thousands of its nationals			0
