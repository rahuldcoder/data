@entity0 , @entity1 -- the coffee was brewing and we were just starting our day when the telephone rang the morning of july 5 , 1999			2
it was a call that every parent prays never will come			2
the @entity9 colonel was calling from @entity10 , @entity11 , where our son was based in the @entity9			1
a fellow soldier had attacked our son , @entity14			1
he had been taken to a civilian hospital in @entity16 , @entity17			0
we raced to the @entity0 airport			0
when we arrived at the hospital , @entity14 was clinging to life			1
contrary to what the colonel had said on the telephone , @entity14 had not been kicked in the head by the other soldier			1
he had been beaten with a baseball bat as he slept in the barracks			1
the doctor said he had irreparable brain damage and recovery was unlikely			0
@entity14 had been a victim of constant , vicious harassment after another soldier -- one of two involved in his murder -- started a rumor that he was gay			1
several of @entity14 's superiors were witnesses to the harassment , yet did nothing about it			1
some of those superiors not only did nothing to stop the escalation of violence that would lead to our son 's death , they also took part in the harassment			1
one staff sergeant eventually stopped participating and started telling others to stop			0
@entity14 was one of his top soldiers and he noticed the effect the torment was having on him			1
the staff sergeant decided to file a complaint with a commanding officer , but it was ignored			0
army values were one of the things that attracted @entity14 to the service			1
loyalty : be true to your country , the @entity9 , your unit , and other soldiers			0
respect : treat others with dignity and respect and expect others to do the same			0
selfless service : put the welfare of the nation , the @entity9 , and your subordinates before your own			0
integrity : do what is right , legally and morally			0
honor : live up to the @entity9 's values			0
clearly , many stationed at @entity10 were not living up to these values			0
and it cost our son his life			2
on july 6 , we said goodbye as the machines that kept @entity14 alive were turned off			1
he loved serving our country			0
and he was among the best in his company			0
@entity14 was awarded two @entity91 and one @entity92 with the @entity93			1
he wanted to be the best he could be and eventually become a helicopter pilot			0
@entity14 's death was -- and remains -- a heart - wrenching tragedy for us			1
in the days and months afterward , we were comforted by the hundreds of letters and e-mails we received			0
many of the authors were gay service members			2
we realized that our son was not alone in the torture he endured			2
we realized that " do n't ask , do n't tell " essentially makes it impossible for gays or those , like @entity14 , who are perceived to be gay , to seek the help of their superiors without risking investigation and discharge			1
since then , we have worked tirelessly to ensure that @entity14 did not die in vain			1
we have spoken around the country , advocating tirelessly for repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" that is because @entity115 amounts to an endorsement of harassment and discrimination			1
it says to other service members that gays in the military are second - class citizens , that they are not worthy of the respect dictated in the @entity9 's values			0
those who assert that the law serves to protect gays in the military are wrong -- it corroborates the fears and bigotry of those who are anti-gay			0
worse , it encourages those who are prone to violence to act on their rage			0
our son could be with these brothers and sisters in arms today , but he was taken from us just as he was beginning to realize his dream			2
he was a quiet , compassionate and strong young man -- the kind of dedicated soldier our country needs as we fight two wars			0
nothing will take away the pain that haunts us to this day			0
the attitude of society toward gays serving in the military has changed in the 17 years since @entity115 went into effect			1
it 's no longer the divisive issue it used to be			0
when we go to @entity153 , we talk about the change we 've witnessed in our lifetimes on @entity156 -- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgendered -- issues			2
it 's clear to us that the younger generation of service members could n't care less about sexual orientation			2
but they could n't care more about integrity and honesty , serving one 's country and being supportive of their comrades			2
our work to repeal the law that contributed to our son 's death has given us focus			1
we look forward to the day when this law is repealed and when the armed forces adopt a policy that demonstrates clearly that all service members , including those who are gay or lesbian , are worthy of serving our country with dignity and integrity			2
only then can our sons and daughters feel safe in reporting harassment			1
only then will their superiors , up the chain of command , be held fully responsible for protecting our sons and daughters equally , no matter what their sexual orientation			2
soon , members of the @entity194 will have an opportunity to ensure that @entity14 's death was not in vain , that no other young man or woman will be denied the chance to serve the country they love simply because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation			1
@entity204 chairman adm. @entity203 has said it is the right thing to do			0
we urge senators to stand with @entity203 and be on the right side of history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 and @entity212 .			1

@entity211 and @entity212 have worked 10 years to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell "
their son , @entity215 . @entity14 , was beaten to death with a bat as he slept
he went through constant , vicious harassment after rumors he was gay , they write
they believe @entity115 *prevented* him from reporting harassment to superiors
