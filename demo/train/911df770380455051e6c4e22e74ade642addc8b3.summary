-- not your typical @entity3 release , " @entity5 " 's fifth is @entity7 's counterpunch to chocolates , roses and romance			1
it 's an anti-date movie			0
well , unless your date is also your dad			0
@entity14 has been playing @entity15 , off and on , for a quarter century now , and while he shows no inclination of throwing in the towel , it 's hard to see much future for the geriatric action film he and his former @entity22 cronies are peddling these days with " @entity23			1
" " @entity31 " is a more lavish demolition derby than " @entity25 " or " @entity26 , " but it 's also more slavish in its adherence to a formula that 's all but spent			0
no one 's heart seems to be in it , they 're just going through the motions			0
why ' @entity5 ' is the perfect @entity3 movie for guys a @entity40 cop who scarcely seems to spend any time in the @entity41 , @entity15 heads out to @entity42 to bail out a deadbeat son , @entity43 , who i do n't recall featuring in the earlier movies			1
@entity46 , from " @entity47 " and " spartacus : @entity55 , " is what they call " fresh meat " and a more conventional action hero than @entity54 was in @entity15 's last escapade			2
but on this evidence @entity15 junior has n't inherited any of his father 's charisma or wry wit			0
mostly he just looks put out , understandable as screenwriter @entity61 makes sure senior always has the last word			0
not that any of @entity14 ' wisecracks are anything to write home about			1
that trademark smirk is stretched pretty thin			0
it 's only after @entity43 has bust out of his trial , dragging a political prisoner with him ( @entity71 ) that @entity15 finds out his boy is with the @entity73			2
by then the extraction is blown , and father and son have a rogue militia wing tearing up the streets gunning for them			2
this is male bonding with a capital " b , " but comparisons with the reinvigorated 007 series only show how far behind " @entity5 " has fallen			1
a lengthy chase on the @entity42 ring road throws entire fleets of @entity88 commuters under the proverbial bus , but still feels like an inferior copy of a similar sequence in " @entity92 , " while director @entity93 ( " @entity94 " ) defaults to the @entity96 editing style that 's only good for disguising how thinly - imagined this show really is			1
even a climactic showdown in @entity99 , a potentially fascinating location for any movie , proves a damp squib			0
@entity93 gives us an abandoned industrial plant at night , and any radiation barely even registers as a factor ( the @entity108 do n't need hazmat suits ; they 're indestructible )			0
if there 's something crassly opportunistic about exploiting a real life disaster on the scale of @entity99 for cheap thrills , that 's part and parcel of the film 's cynicism			2
there 's always been an undercurrent of xenophobia in the " @entity5 " series , but this movie 's crude insistence on a corrupt , morally bankrupt @entity88 betrays simple - minded nostalgia for those @entity126 days when the @entity127 demarcated good and evil			2
do i ask too much from an action film ? if so it 's only because i have n't forgotten how good the first " @entity5 " was ( and still is )			1
the producers keep throwing more money at the franchise , but in this case more is less			0
less attention to character , coherence and suspense , the very qualities that made " @entity5 " stand out in the first place			1
" @entity31 " ? a good time to call it a day .			1

@entity14 is back for the latest *installment* in the " @entity5 " franchise
the film finds his character traveling to @entity42 to find his son
*critic* says it may be time to call it a day
