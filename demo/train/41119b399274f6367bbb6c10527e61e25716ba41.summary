-- two schools : one a football powerhouse , steeped in athletic glory , and the other a bastion of military tradition			2
each have faced allegations in recent weeks of child sexual abuse -- in the case of @entity11 , by a former assistant football coach ; at @entity17 , by an alumnus and former counselor at the college 's summer camp			1
and in each case , the schools did not notify law enforcement after allegations were made , drawing criticism for apparently choosing to protect the institution 's reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims -- something many find hard to understand			1
" i think this is a pattern which is not surprising , " said @entity27 , executive director of the @entity28 and a social ethics professor at @entity30 in @entity31			1
" institutions would like to find a reason that they do n't have to publicize their own failings			1
... institutions too often substitute their own interests for the interests of the victims			1
this is an institutional ethics problem , in general			2
" retired air force lt. gen. @entity40 , president of @entity17 , apologized in a press conference monday for not reporting to police an allegation against @entity43 , 32			1
in 2007 , @entity17 received an allegation from a former camper that five years earlier , @entity43 had invited the boy into his room at @entity17 to watch pornography			1
another camper was also present			2
they did not touch each other , but engaged in sexual activity , the college said			2
@entity43 was arrested last month and faces at least six charges , including three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of lewd acts on a minor , according to police in the @entity61 , @entity62 , suburb of @entity63			2
although police did not provide specifics , @entity0 affiliate @entity64 reported @entity43 was accused of molesting at least five boys			2
according to court documents , he has admitted guilt in at least three cases involving incidents between november 2010 and october 2011			2
meanwhile , at @entity11 , legendary football coach @entity72 and university president @entity73 were fired after former assistant football coach @entity74 was arrested and charged with child rape and sexual abuse following the release of a grand jury report detailing alleged crimes between 1994 and 2009			1
authorities allege @entity74 accessed many of his victims through @entity83 , the charity he founded			1
@entity84 to @entity11 : we support you one incident , allegedly the rape of a young boy , was witnessed by then - graduate assistant coach @entity90 in 2002 , in a shower in @entity11 's athletic facilities , according to the grand jury report			1
@entity90 told @entity72 what he had seen , and @entity72 alerted the athletic director , @entity95 , but no one notified police			2
@entity95 and @entity98 , @entity11 's senior vice president for finance and business , face charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities			1
in an interview with @entity105 on monday night , @entity74 denied he is a pedophile and said he is innocent of charges he sexually abused young boys			2
he conceded that he should not have showered with any of them			2
@entity11 's football culture could inspire a reaction of " we need to rally and protect that institution , " and @entity17 has a storied and proud military history , @entity27 said , and " one can imagine that there would be considerable hesitation " to report the allegations to police			1
" this is the same mentality which has gotten the @entity118 continually in trouble , " @entity27 said			2
" it 's the desire not to have a respected institution embarrassed and its reputation tarnished			2
it 's a desire to protect their own , and that 's clearest in the @entity11 issue			1
" the parallels between @entity11 's situation and the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the @entity118 are " very pronounced , " he said			1
the fact that @entity72 and @entity74 were revered in the @entity11 community could also have played a role			1
@entity134 , a @entity11 graduate and @entity83 alumnus who is now a graduate student at the @entity136 , told @entity0 that when he went home to @entity140 , @entity141 , and heard about the investigation into @entity74 's alleged acts , people 's " reactions were all the same : how could they ruin this man 's name around town ? " he told @entity0			1
it did n't seem to occur to them that the allegations could be true , he said			1
" i do n't think it 's anything unique to universities , " said @entity151 , an expert on behavioral decision - making and organizational behavior at the @entity154			1
" i think the same sorts of things happen in organizations in general and in life in general			0
" he referenced the " bystander effect , " in which people know someone is being hurt and do nothing			0
a number of explanations can be given for that , including " diffusion of responsibility , " in which the pressure on people to act is reduced because of the number of people who may share in the knowledge			0
in addition , there is " pluralistic ignorance , " in which people assume everyone else may know something they do n't , he said			0
people may assume someone else is taking action , or that those above them are handling the situation , @entity151 said			0
he cited the recent case of @entity186 , a @entity187 toddler who drew international attention after a security camera showed her being run over by two drivers and ignored by numerous passerby as she lay injured in the road			0
the 2 - year - old girl later died , and the video sparked a global outcry about the state of morality in @entity187			0
" criminal law imposes very few affirmative obligations on people , " said @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity199			0
" by that i mean criminal law is mostly about ' do n't do this , do n't do that			0
do n't kill somebody , do n't do drugs , do n't engage in fraud			0
' " but , he said , " the law is much less clear or less frequently used to tell people to do things			0
" there are a variety of historical reasons for that , he said , but " as a result , people have developed the idea that it 's safer to do nothing than do something			0
" both @entity74 and @entity43 are innocent until proven guilty , @entity27 noted			0
but , he said , " the difference between the legal and the moral ( obligations ) , while important , obscures the fact that every individual who sees the abuse , who sees an evil like this , should feel morally obliged to act in order to protect the victim and future victims			1
" people should consider that a person accused of molesting a child could continue to commit such crimes , he said			0
the whistle - blower effect may also have contributed to the lack of action , @entity151 said			0
" whoever it is that would speak out , either going to the police or to the press , that person is essentially a whistle - blower , and we know that whistle - blower -- that 's a tremendous role to take on , especially if you 're in a situation where you 're probably going to cause huge harm to the university and people involved , and especially if you 're in a position without too much power , " he said			0
" ... they 're permanently scarred by this			0
" @entity74 interview infuriates critics " the discussion of whistle - blowers over the last 25 years has struggled with this question of institutional interest and concern for individuals who are harmed by the behavior of representatives of that institution , " @entity27 said			0
" ... there are many laws in the @entity272 which simply require reporting it to the institution			0
it is an ongoing dilemma of whether that 's enough			0
should we require , legally , individuals to report misbehavior not just to their institutions , but to police and public authorities ? " @entity141 is considering adopting a mandatory reporting law in the wake of the scandal			1
@entity27 said such a law is already in place in @entity31 , requiring health care workers , teachers and others to report suspicions to police " regardless of what their institution does			1
" the law was passed " because of concerns like this -- ' i washed my hands of the responsibility because i told my boss , ' " @entity27 said			0
" as word of misbehavior goes up the chain of command , each level will have the temptation to sweep it under the rug , " he said			0
" and they can frequently be pressured to ignore the behavior			0
... " what you hope will happen in the future is that anyone who witnesses a child being molested will take the personal responsibility to make sure the authorities are called and not just report it to the institution			1

both @entity11 and @entity17 are criticized for failing to report abuse allegations
