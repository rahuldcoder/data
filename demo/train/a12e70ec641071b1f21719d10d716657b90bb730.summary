video of a tourist plunging into the @entity2 after her bungee cord snapped on @entity4 is enough to make anyone think twice before leaping from the @entity6			1
but anyone planning a visit to @entity6 will be relieved to know it 's not just about bungee jumping			1
often listed as one of the seven natural wonders of the world , the falls and their surrounding gorges are a truly awe - inspiring sight			1
they were named after the @entity19 queen in 1855 by @entity22 explorer @entity20 , but their local name of " @entity25 " -- meaning " the smoke that thunders " -- is far more descriptive			2
the roar of the @entity2 tumbling from the falls is indeed thunderous , and the thick spray that swirls like smoke around the cascade can be seen for miles			2
the falls straddle the border between @entity34 and @entity35 , in the heart of two national parks -- the @entity38 on the @entity34 side and the @entity40 in @entity35 , which collectively form a @entity41			1
at 1.7 kilometers wide and up to 100 meters high they are not be the tallest or widest falls in the world , but many consider them to be the most spectacular			1
discovering the real @entity34 some connoisseurs argue they are best see seen from the @entity35 side , others say from @entity34 , but in truth if you visit at the right time both sides offer a mind - blowing view			1
when to go to see them at their most impressive you should visit when the @entity2 is in full flow , usually in february or march			1
at this time , they form the largest curtain of falling water in the world , with more than 500 million liters of water spilling over the falls each minute			2
visit in november and you 'll see the falls at their most tame , with barely a 50th of that amount flowing through			2
what to do even if you do n't fancy a bungee jump , there 's plenty to give adrenaline junkies their fix			1
the falls churn up torrents of raging white water , and where there 's white water , there 's white water rafting			1
among the many outfits offering rafting thrills the @entity83 and @entity84 is one of the best , offering one - day experiences from $ 135			0
a more sedate aquatic experience can be had in a canoe or , for those who prefer not to rely on muscle power , on a river cruise along the @entity2			0
for the more culturally inclined , the town of @entity20 , some 10 kilometers from the falls , is the place to go			1
the colonial capital of @entity34 ( then @entity98 ) until 1935 , it 's home to the @entity100 , dedicated to the 19th - century explorer			1
it preserves a variety of @entity20 memorabilia , including his letters and medicine box , and has an exhibit on @entity34 history			1
how @entity109 turned from war zone to tourist hotspot best views a truly vertigo - inducing experience can be had standing in the spray on " @entity116 " bridge and daring yourself to look down at the seething waters below			0
but you can trump that by taking at dip in " @entity25 , " a natural rock pool high above the @entity2 , where you can swim to the very edge of the falls and peer over			0
the most dramatic views of the falls and the gorges can be had by hovering directly above them in a helicopter or microlight			0
for a short nostalgia trip , why not take a steam train ride across the historic @entity6			1
@entity133 's erupting volcano boosts tourism wildlife around the falls a fragile forest ecosystem thrives on the high humidity created by the spray from the falls			2
both national parks offer great opportunities for wildlife watching			2
elephants , zebras , giraffes and hippos can all be found in the area , as can leopards , baboons and buffalo			1
you can take a safari on the back of an elephant , or alternatively , a number of tour groups offer lion encounters that let tourists walk with captive - bred lions			0
there are also birding safaris that offer glimpses black eagles , peregrine falcons and taita falcons soaring among the gorges			0
where to stay there is a wide range of accommodation in the area , from the cheap and cheerful to the expensive and extravagant			0
in @entity20 , hostel @entity173 , named after a @entity19 sitcom , has a large garden shaded by sprawling mango trees			0
it offers camping facilities , private rooms and dorm beds that start at $ 10			0
facilities include a swimming pool , lively bar and wi - fi			0
at the other end of the spectrum the @entity186 provides five - star luxury right on the banks of the @entity2			0
consisting of 17 colonial - style buildings , it 's within walking distance from the falls themselves			0
rooms start from $ 700			0
a little further away , and priced somewhere between the two , the boutique @entity197 has suites from $ 245 per person , and is situated on a private reserve bordering the @entity201 in @entity35 .			2

@entity6 is n't just about bungee jumping -- it offers rafting , wildlife and river trips
the falls *stretch* 1.7 kilometers , on the border of @entity34 and @entity35
february and march is when the falls are at their most spectacular
elephants , zebras , giraffes and hippos all live in the surrounding parks
