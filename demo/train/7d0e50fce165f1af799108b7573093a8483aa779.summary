-- hyperbolic @entity2 threats of war are not new			1
what is new is the intensity and persistence of those threats this time around			0
add to that an untested 29 - year - old leader who is suddenly a four - star general with lots to prove			0
how does this end ? consider these three possibilities : 1			0
what @entity12 hopes : @entity2 threats continue to escalate			1
@entity15 renews earlier threats to transfer its " nuclear deterrent capability " to third parties in the @entity18 and declares @entity21 waters west of the peninsula an open fire zone			1
the @entity21 stock market plummets			2
@entity26 leaders begin to panic about instability on their border			2
@entity29 is desperate to set aside the @entity2 problem while dealing with a parallel crisis in @entity32			2
the @entity2 proposes negotiations on a peace treaty formally ending the @entity35 , but only if international sanctions imposed on the regime after their previous nuclear and missile tests are suspended			1
@entity29 , @entity40 and @entity41 reluctantly agree to the @entity2 's terms to avoid further escalation			2
meanwhile , the @entity2 continues miniaturizing uranium - based nuclear weapons in underground facilities			2
one year later , they test a more sophisticated warhead design and improved missiles payload			0
the @entity50 then demands the end of remaining international sanctions , recognition as a legitimate nuclear weapons state and a summit meeting in @entity15 between @entity12 and president @entity56			1
to back up its threat , the @entity2 shells several @entity21 islands and threatens to use its newly enhanced nuclear capability if the @entity21 retaliates			2
the crisis resumes , but with the @entity2 more dangerous			0
this has more or less been the pattern thus far			0
what @entity29 , @entity40 and @entity41 hope : @entity12 's unpredictability finally turns the @entity2 's erstwhile ally , @entity26 , firmly against the regime			1
intensifying @entity71 - @entity70 - @entity21 defense cooperation demonstrates how @entity2 actions are isolating @entity26 within the region			1
@entity75 vows to step up pressure on the regime and stops all inbound @entity2 ships and planes for inspections based on @entity82 resolutions			2
opinion : why @entity2 worries @entity84 when @entity12 tries to escalate again , @entity75 cuts oil shipments to the @entity2 by 50 % ( @entity26 's food and fuel shipments keep the small @entity2 economy afloat )			1
the @entity50 agrees to a moratorium on testing of missiles and nuclear weapons and to resume earlier negotiations on denuclearization			0
those talks move at a glacial pace because the @entity2 sees nuclear weapons as its only means of regime survival			2
but @entity12 's obvious mismanagement of the confrontation has discredited him in front of his generals			0
fissures open , and the regime begins slowly to unravel			0
careful @entity71 and @entity21 coordination with @entity26 throughout the crisis lays the basis for a managed unification of the peninsula , removal of the @entity2 's nuclear and @entity113 arsenal , and freedom for millions of @entity2			1
what everyone fears most : @entity12 's escalation strategy fails to cause the other powers to recognize the @entity2 as a legitimate nuclear weapons state or to ease sanctions			1
the young leader and his advisers continue searching for threats that will terrify the @entity21 and cause @entity26 to provide further bribes for good behavior , but without provoking a massive @entity71 attack on the @entity2			1
the exuberant but inexperienced @entity12 approves live artillery fire on uninhabited mountains just outside the @entity21 capital of @entity40			1
the @entity21 responds with limited counterbattery fire against the @entity2 artillery units			1
opinion : does @entity2 think @entity71 is soft ? aware that it can not surrender or win , the @entity2 opens broader and deadlier artillery and missile broadsides against the @entity21			1
knowing that these forward deployed artillery and missile forces pose the greatest threat to the @entity21 if not taken out , @entity71 and @entity21 forces hammer @entity2 emplacements north of the @entity140			1
the conflict ends with defeat of @entity2 forces and decapitation of the @entity2 leadership through massive airstrikes , but the damage to @entity21 and @entity70 , which is within missile range , is appalling			1
how does this end ? right now we are somewhere between the first two scenarios -- and could remain ambiguously so for some time			0
the third scenario remains highly unlikely , though not impossible			0
the first scenario is tempting for some , because it would temporarily ease tensions , but in the long run it makes the third scenario more likely and much more lethal			0
that means that @entity71 policy has to focus on realizing scenario two			0
the @entity2 's brazen actions make that more possible than ever			0
but it means not blinking			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity163 : @entity2 more threatening than usual ; three scenarios may play out
1 . nuke threats grow ; regime will get @entity71 to lift sanctions ; regime returns to same *tactics*
2 . @entity26 will turn on @entity2 , cut it off ; @entity12 will lose power ; @entity50 *reunite* sans nukes
3 . @entity12 will fire on @entity21 ; @entity71 will get involved ; @entity2 will fall ; @entity70 , @entity21 ravaged
