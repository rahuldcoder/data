-- that is my question today			2
are you involved in your kid 's school ? if so , how much ? as a new mom in the district , i 'm being pitched pretty hard by the @entity9			1
and as a chronic joiner / doer / over committer , i 'm intrigued			2
but i 'm also wary			2
@entity11 has been in school for a week now			2
on monday i went to a breakfast put on by the pta — i mostly went just to check it out ( and to avoid my deadline ) but i wound up signing up for six or seven committees			1
ack ! many of these " committees " are really just one event that you might help with — a @entity23 plant sale , say — so it 's not that crazy			1
right ? parenting.com : the sport i 'm not sure i 'd let my son play a form also came home in @entity11 's kindergarten folder to sign up to be the class mom			1
i remember my mom being the class mom a lot and i loved the security it gave me to know she was so entrenched in the system			2
she knew the teachers , she knew the other moms , the kids , the school			1
she was also the ccd teacher , the @entity40 leader , the carpool driver and pretty much everything else you 'd find under the overarching title of @entity45			2
i do n't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom ( for now ) , but i do want to be involved			0
and the @entity9 seems like a no - brainer , right ? that said , i worry about taking on more than i can handle			1
i 'm still feeling the after - effects of my all - encompassing ( and beyond worth it ) @entity53 campaign and have already signed up to be a big part of that event again this year			0
( i 'm posting this blog from a café in @entity59 where i 'm spending the day at @entity53 meetings among other things )			0
my work with the organization is hugely important to me			0
as is my writing career			0
and my ( limited ) free time			0
parenting.com : confessions of an inner - city school teacher i try not to do anything half assed but i also have a tendency to not say no enough			0
and so i over commit and then i feel overwhelmed and i hate to feel overwhelmed			1
or do i love it ? i can never quite tell			0
sometimes i think i 'm only good at any one thing when i 'm doing 12 things			0
but back to the @entity9			1
are you involved in yours ? what 's your experience been like ? is it anything like you see in the movies with cliques and mean - girl behavior ? are there the @entity84 ? parenting.com : healthy toddler lunch ideas bottom line is this : one of the main reasons i left the full - time , editor - at - a - magazine ( with benefits and health insurance ) world years ago is so that i would be able to have an active role in my kids ' day - to - day lives			1
and , ultimately , their schooling			0
so i figure i better get started now			0
a new friend at the bus stop gave me good advice , which was to sign up for the @entity9 activities that get you face time with your kid — working an event that the kindergarteners will attend , for example , as opposed to something for the older students			1
kids get a kick out of seeing their parents at school , right ? and also to do things that get you face time with the teacher — staff appreciation , for example — because , well , that one is self explanatory , especially given my worries about @entity11 's pain in the ass - ness			1
parenting.com : 15 unbelievable birth stories i signed up for several different committees ( including something having to do with gardening and one about recycling , which are both in my wheelhouse ) and i figure i 'll dabble for a bit , get to see what it 's all about and then go from there			1
it 's only week one of about 18 years of schooling so i have time			0
are you involved in the @entity9 ? when did you get involved and what 's your experience been like ? would love to hear your thoughts and any advice ! please share your experience in the comments section below			1

parents who over commit may be *tempted* to join too many @entity9 committees
some crave an active role in their kids ' lives but soon get overwhelmed
one *solution* is to sign up for @entity9 activities that allow you to *interact* with your child
