men with prostate cancer who were previously infected with the sexually transmitted germ @entity3 are more likely to have an aggressive form of the cancer , compared with men who never had the @entity7 , a new study says			1
researchers say trichomonas , an @entity7 , is most common in men ages 25 to 39			2
the germ , a type of parasite , can infect the prostate and may cause inflammation that spurs the growth of prostate cancer later in life , says senior author @entity19 , @entity20 , an assistant professor of epidemiology at the @entity22			1
" our underlying hypothesis is around inflammation and , in particular , we believe that inflammation from a variety of sources is leading to prostate cancer progression , " she says			1
in the study , @entity19 and colleagues compared 673 prostate cancer patients to 673 men without prostate cancer , and tested their blood for signs of a past infection with trichomonas			1
all the men were enrolled in the physician 's @entity39 , according to the report published this week in the @entity42			0
they found that roughly one in five men had been infected with trichomonas at some point in his life			2
men infected with trichomonas were no more likely to develop prostate cancer in general			1
but those with a past trichomonas infection were two to three times more likely to develop an aggressive and potentially life - threatening form of prostate cancer			1
@entity55 affects 174 million people around the world each year , and , at any given time , about 3 percent of younger men are infected with trichomonas ; it is most common in men ages 25 to 39			1
however , trichomonas is an std that 's probably on more women 's radars than men 's because women are more likely to get symptoms such as discharge and itching			2

( the std can be cured quickly with antibiotics			0
) " i think the only time men really seek any medical intervention is if their partner has been diagnosed and then they may go and get treated as well , " says @entity19			0
" i think the general feeling has been that this is an acute infection , it will eventually clear itself , and it does n't seem to be doing any real harm ; but in this case it may actually be doing harm -- you 're just not seeing the harm until 20 years in the future			0
" infections are just one factor that researchers are examining as potential players in the growth of prostate cancer , and others -- such as dietary choices -- are thought to influence prostate cancer risk as well			1

prostate cancer is rare in @entity108 countries but relatively common in @entity110 nations , and researchers feel it 's probably due to some component of the @entity110 diet , says @entity100 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study			1
" what this study explores and similar studies are exploring is whether there are potentially infectious causes that result in prostate cancer going from a relatively dormant disease to one that 's clinically significant , " says @entity100			1
" this study raises the issue that a common bug , @entity3 , could be such an agent			0
" while the link to prostate cancer may sound surprising , there are other cancers caused by @entity7			2
for example , cervical cancer in women is caused by the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus ( @entity72 )			0
( however , @entity72 is a common infection and many women who are infected with the virus never develop cancer , which is relatively rare			0
) @entity70 : how @entity72 causes cervical cancer and abnormal pap smears " [ although ] there is some evidence that suggests that the number of partners that a man has had over his lifetime is associated with increased risk of developing prostate cancer , " says @entity19 , the relationship is not as clear - cut for prostate cancer as it is for cervical cancer			2
there is no strong indicator that an @entity7 causes prostate cancer , and researchers suspect that trichomonas is just one inflammation - causing factor that may contribute to the cancer or make it grow faster			1
" we think that inflammation is what 's important , " she says			0
" this inflammation may result from trichomonas , a dietary factor , or it could result from oxidative stress from something like smoking or other factors			0

" what needs to happen is a few more researchers need to tackle this issue to either nail this down as a true relationship or dispense with it , " says @entity100			0
@entity70 : who 's most at risk for @entity7 ? however , it 's an important issue to consider , he says			0
" right now if you asked if the average urologist or internist , ' does trichomonas vaginalis lead to prostate cancer ? ' , the answer would be no , and in fact this study does n't prove a cause - and - effect relationship , " he says			1
" but if we begin to see that infections in general can be associated with prostate cancer , we might begin to take a new view on this disease and the appropriate treatment leading up to it			2
