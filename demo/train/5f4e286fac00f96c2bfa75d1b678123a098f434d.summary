sen. @entity0 announced in 2008 that he had a brain tumor in his left parietal lobe			1
sen. @entity0 announced in may 2008 that he was suffering from a brain tumor , a malignant glioma , in his left parietal lobe			1
he had surgery at @entity6 in june 2008			2
is surgery the usual course of treatment to take ? dr. @entity10 , @entity11 chief medical correspondent : yes , surgery to remove the tumor is common , provided surgeons are able to remove a large part of the tumor and as long as they can avoid causing unacceptable neurologic injury			2
the goal with surgery to remove a brain tumor is to get as much of the tumor as possible without damaging the key areas of the brain that control speech and motor skills			2
this was something @entity0 's doctors would have determined prior to surgery by taking @entity30 to see how close his tumor is to these key areas			1
many people will choose not to operate in fear of losing ability to speak , walk , etc. if the tumor is causing pressure on his brain , they could be doing surgery to remove the tumor			2
this will reduce some of the side effects he may be experiencing , such as headache , nausea , vomiting or blurred vision			0
the senator was awake during his surgery			0
oftentimes it is that feedback that the patient himself gives that is so crucial : " squeeze your right hand , senator ; move your right arm , " that sort of thing			0
" can you say the following word ... " that sort of stuff is very crucial			0
how common is brain cancer ? @entity10 : 1.3 percent of all cancers are brain cancers			0
twenty thousand cases will be diagnosed in 2008 , according to the @entity67 and the @entity68			0
fourteen percent will occur in the parietal lobe , which is where @entity0 's tumor is located			1
the majority of cases occur in patients over the age of 55			0
how common is it to follow surgery with chemotherapy and radiation ? @entity10 : neurosurgeons agree that malignant gliomas are very resilient to treatment			1
sometimes , surgery alone is not enough to cure the cancer , because cells from the tumor get too far into the normal surrounding brain tissue			0
in this instance , surgery combined with radiation therapy and or chemotherapy is often used			1
there is very well - established evidence that radiation therapy doubles survival in patients with glioblastoma			1
if he starts radiation following the surgery , it would typically be five days a week for 30 days .			1

bottom line : in cases such as @entity0 's , surgery combined with radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both is often used .
