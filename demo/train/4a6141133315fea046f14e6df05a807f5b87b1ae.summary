@entity1 @entity0 has tried to discourage the groups urging her to run for president			1
the senator flatly said " no " when asked about running in 2016			0
she backed @entity7 's likely candidacy in a 2013 letter			0
and she told @entity2 a whopping six times -- in one interview -- that she was n't running			0
all of that , though , matters little to the coalition of liberal groups behind @entity14 , a liberal draft campaign for the first - term senator			1
these activists , who hunger for a 2016 option that fits their progressive mold , look at the senator 's refusals as a reason to up the ante , not quietly back away			1
their hope that is that their money , organization and manpower can convince @entity31 , the once little - known @entity32 professor , that she could become the first madam president			1
one month without a @entity7 headliner this dance played out clearly on thursday when the liberal coalition of @entity38 and @entity39 announced that they are expanding their early presidential state action by opening an office in @entity42 and hiring a former @entity44 staffer -- @entity45 -- to run their state operation			2
their announcement comes two days after @entity31 told former @entity51 chairman @entity50 , in an interview with @entity53 , that she was n't running for president			1
" so are you going to run for president ? " questioned @entity50			2
" no , " said @entity31			2
some democrats -- especially those who want to see another @entity60 president -- saw this as a reason for the groups to stop their persistence			1
but the @entity14 reaction to @entity31 's statement was simple and different : this is why we are doing what we are doing			2
" sen. @entity31 is not planning to run for president , " said @entity70 , head of @entity38 's @entity1 office			1
" the whole point is to make the case to her and encourage her to change her mind			0
" rating 2016 candidates by donor busts conventional wisdom and in an apparent shot at @entity7 , the @entity60 frontrunner who has been quietly building a political staff before a likely presidential run , @entity70 added , " she is not building a secret campaign apparatus and hoping someone taps her shoulder			2
she is not floating trial balloons			0
" @entity38 , who pledged at the start to spend $ 1 million on the @entity31 draft effort , has started to fundraise from their members to prolong the project			2
" yes , we have been fundraising for the @entity14 effort , " @entity95 , the group 's spokesman			0
" we 're confident that our initial $ 1 million investment is a beginning floor			0
" the key words there are " beginning floor			0
" in addition to their @entity42 office and organizers , the group announced earlier this week ( on the same day @entity31 said " no " ) that they were kicking off their efforts in @entity107 , another critical presidential state			1
these efforts will include multiple offices in the state and a local staff			0
none of that is cheap			0
for liberal groups , though , propping up @entity31 is not a selfless act , either			1
when @entity31 is involved , @entity38 organizers say , their members become more engaged and excited			1
and by keeping @entity31 's name in the mix of prospective 2016 candidates , the groups are also raising their profile and importance			1
liberal groups slate @entity125 rally in @entity107 for that reason , @entity70 and @entity38 are not prepared to say at what point they will buy @entity31 's " no. " " so much can change in politics , so much is fluid , " the organizer said			1
" things that are certain one day , may not be the next			0
our focus is on maximizing the possibility that she does			0

@entity0 has said repeatedly that she wo n't run for president in 2016
but to a group of liberal organizers urging her to do so , her refusals are reason to ante up
the *reality* is that keeping @entity31 in the 2016 mix helps these groups , too
