-- a @entity2 job - seeker has " sold " himself with an online resume made to look like an @entity6 page , proving that some creativity and attention to personal branding can go a long way			1
@entity11 began his trawl for a new job as a web product manager in late december			1
depressed by the thought of sending a regular resume into the ether as part of the usual job application process , he built his to look like an @entity6 page , complete with product dimensions , five - star ratings , world - wide shipping and even a gift - wrap option			1
" @entity6 's pages just naturally fit the form of a resume , " he said			1
" i just thought that if a company thinks that this is fun , then that 's a company i would like to work for			2
" " at first i sent it out as a link with the normal job applications i was sending , but then sent an email to a popular @entity2 blog saying ' hey guys , if you 're bored and have nothing to look at ... ' " that was the beginning of last week			0
from there its journey across blogs and social media has propelled it from around 500 hits a day to over 200,000 , and the page has gained over 27,000 @entity47 " likes "			2
but more than just being a fleeting @entity50 sensation , @entity11 's @entity6 resume has also done what it was designed for			1
from the 800 or so messages he has received over 100 have been work - related with job offers coming from across @entity54 and @entity55			1
" quite a few are great and are really fit what i 'm looking for , " he said			0
imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery and @entity11 admits that @entity6 is one of the companies he greatly admires and would like to work for			1
however he remains tight - lipped about how the company has responded , or even if it have contacted him at all			0
as well as being a smart piece of design , the creative resume also shows @entity11 's personality , something he believes has helped it reach its target audience			1
" it made me realize how important personal branding is , " he says			1
@entity72 , author and career and life advisor agrees : " personal packaging is absolutely vital " she says			0
" if you think about it , people do n't buy products , they hire them to do a job			0
you have to figure out a way to make employers believe that you 're the person who can get a job done			0
it is not the responsibility of any future employer to figure out how the employee can do the job , it 's the employee 's responsibility			0
" @entity11 's advice to others is to do what you can to differentiate yourself from other would - be job - hunters and be creative with it			1
" although that does n't apply for all industries ; if i was an accountant it 's not the same , " he says			0
" but you can always do something that is relevant to the industry you work in			0
" the overwhelming response to @entity11 's experiment did make him question if he should n't take his career in a different direction instead of just search for a new job			2
" it occurred to me , and many friends said the same , that maybe i should ( do something different )			0
but in the end i did this for a job and it has opened up opportunities with companies i really want to work for			2
i was so completely not expecting this			2

web product *developer* created online cv to look like @entity6 page
resume went viral and @entity11 gained over 100 offers of work
" i was so completely not expecting this , " he says
