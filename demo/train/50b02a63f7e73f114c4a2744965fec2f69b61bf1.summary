@entity3 's players celebrate after winning their only piece of silverware this season			0
@entity0 midfielder @entity18 scored their winner in the 72nd minute after @entity20 had equalized @entity22 's opening goal for @entity7 , which came after just 25 seconds			1
@entity18 cut inside to fire an emphatic left foot strike past @entity7 goalkeeper @entity24 who could merely help it into the net			1
it was @entity3 's first trophy of a season in which they briefly challenged for the @entity32 title and went out in the semifinals of the @entity34 in controversial fashion to eventual winners @entity36			0
@entity38 national coach hiddink took the reigns at @entity40 on a temporary basis in february after the sacking of @entity43 and has presided over a remarkable change in @entity3 's fortunes			1

@entity3 started as favorites , but it was @entity7 who made a remarkable start to the final as @entity93 international @entity92 cushioned a header for @entity22 to fire home with an emphatic left foot volley which left @entity97 clutching at thin air			1
the strike made @entity6 history and was a dream start for the underdogs , but @entity103 was giving @entity105 problems down the left flank , drawing a yellow card for the @entity7 defender and then forcing his way past him before testing @entity24 as the ball was scrambled away			1
@entity7 did not heed the warning and on 21 minutes @entity103 was given space and time to find @entity20 with a pinpoint cross which he headed firmly past @entity24			1
@entity7 's attacks were becoming more sporadic as they struggled to gain meaningful possession in midfield and it was @entity3 who had the best opportunity just before half - time as the ball rebounded kindly for man of the match @entity122 , but his shot from an acute angle was sprayed wide			1
@entity7 manager @entity59 hauled off the hapless @entity105 at half time to shore up the right side of the @entity7 defense with @entity128 @entity127			2
@entity3 also made a change on the hour as @entity130 went off to be replaced by @entity131 in central midfield , but it was @entity7 who appeared to benefit more from the changes and from a @entity136 cross @entity22 came desperately close to his second of the match as he headed over			1
@entity3 's first meaningful attack of the second half came as @entity122 crossed for @entity20 to head into the side - netting at the near post , but soon afterwards @entity18 scored after being set up by @entity143			1
@entity103 then blazed over from close range and saw a 20 - meter effort thump the underside of the crossbar with @entity3 appealing for a goal			2
for all their endeavor , @entity7 could offer little in the way of reply and it was the @entity3 players who were celebrating as referee @entity154 brought the curtain down on the 128th fa cup final			2
@entity0 full - back @entity122 entered the record books as he became the first player since the late 1800s to win five finals , three of them with former club @entity161			0
meanwhile , north of the border , @entity162 completed a domestic double by beating @entity165 1 - 0 in the @entity167 final in @entity168 , with half - time substitute @entity169 scoring a spectacular long - range winner just 29 seconds after coming on .			1
