-- although reincarnation is never discussed in " @entity3 , " past lives exert a powerful presence in this lulling , happy - face story of retirement - age self - renewal , set in a shimmering , weltering , jewel - colored @entity9			1
except in this case , the recycling is n't of souls but of the elements of box office success			2
so to get the most out of the manufactured " @entity16 " experience -- or at least to find something to say afterward other than '' well , that was ... cute '' -- it helps first to meditate on the karmic path that has led to this moment in time , and this blending of sanitized " @entity27 " exoticism with the popular " @entity26 " promise of reinvention abroad			1
likewise , to best enjoy this warming tale of seven @entity31 pensioners who come to @entity32 for their retirement , it helps to watch the actors in a kind of memory trance that summons up past performances overlaid on the present			2
while admiring @entity39 now as a stalwart widow in financial straits after her husband 's death , for instance , try summoning up the image of her as the stalwart widow @entity46 in @entity47 , mrs. @entity48			1
while enjoying the delightful apoplexies of @entity50 as an acidic old bat afraid of anything foreign , think of the many great , scenery - chewing variations she has done in recent years since inhabiting the body of professor @entity56 throughout the " @entity58 " saga			1
the star may trot out a working woman 's accent here , but it 's impossible to tune out the chiming imperiousness of her @entity64 of @entity65 on " @entity66			1
" the @entity67 are joined by @entity69 vets @entity70 ( " @entity81 " ) , @entity71 ( " @entity66 " ) , @entity72 ( " in the bedroom " ) , @entity74 ( " @entity75 " ) , and @entity76 ( " @entity82 " ) , each a character in search of a new lease on life and intrigued by the marketing come - on of the title hotel , with its offer of comfy amenities '' for the @entity87 and @entity88			0
'' ' @entity89 ' : meet the guys ! of course , when they arrive ( their dusty white @entity69 butts bruised by the indignities of @entity96 travel ) , the hotel is not exactly as advertised			0
phones do n't work , not every room has its own door , that sort of thing			0
on the flip side , the place is run by " @entity27 's " young , winning @entity104 , here playing an ambitious fellow named @entity106 , so the energy of the place is good			1
this optimistic business go - getter loves a pretty girl ( @entity110 ) who works in one of those outsourced - labor call centers that have invigorated the @entity9 economy and exasperated @entity115 credit - card customers with questions about their accounts			0
the affinities between outsourced office laborers and outsourced retirees are pointed out as if by an exhaustively thorough tour guide			0
to be sure , there 's something comfortable -- and comforting -- about all this			2
as directed by @entity128 ( reunited with @entity39 after her majesty , mrs. @entity48 and @entity130 ) from a screenplay by @entity132 ( " @entity127 " ) based on a novel by @entity134 , the movie is as reliable as a tea bag			0
and with no more " @entity136 " in the pipeline and a lull between seasons of " @entity66 , " it 's a pip to see these players be so ... @entity31			2
@entity142 ' brownface ' ad pulled the loyal if unhappily married husband ( tender - funny @entity70 ) and his perpetually dissatisfied wife ( @entity71 ) face their marital crossroads ; the mournful judge ( @entity72 ) attends to a heartache from his past ; the fading @entity149 © e ( @entity74 ) and the decaying swinger ( @entity76 ) each address the sexuality of aging singletons			0
@entity50 gets to bite into some tasty lines of dialogue ( " if i ca n't pronounce it , i wo n't eat it " ) and trundle around in a wheelchair ( her character has come to @entity9 for an economy - priced hip replacement )			1
the soundtrack favors jaunty sitar melodies			0
the cinematography shows off the overwhelming sensory stimulation of the place while stepping briskly around less - than - colorful images of real poverty , squalor , overcrowding , and despair			0
as a brand extender ( for the senior cast , for the director , and certainly for @entity104 , following the grand success of " slumdog " ) , " @entity3 " achieves what it sets out to do : sell something safe and sweet , in a vivid foreign setting , to an underserved share of the moviegoing market			1
the questions we 're left to ponder are : what 's the karmic consequence of putting profit goals ahead of creative energy ? what will the next reincarnation of this kind of movie look like ? and who will @entity50 play ? b - see full article at @entity0			1
