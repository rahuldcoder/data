i can clearly remember that first moment i felt like a foot soldier in the " mommy wars			0
" six years ago , in between news assignments , i raced to catch my then - 2 - year - old daughter 's gymnastics class			1
it was @entity8 , which meant all of us moms and a few dads gathered to " ooh " and " ahh " at what our future olympians had learned so far			1
but then class was over and i had an interview i had to dash off to , something not many toddlers would easily accept			0
my daughter cried her eyes out and clung to my body			0
as i had to gently pry her arms off me and make my exit , i noticed all the moms staring at me -- or rather glaring			1
their eyes said it all			0
" how could you leave your daughter ? " " i would never do that to my child			0
" as the tears began to flow on my way back to the office , i felt guilty , but also angry			0
" why all the judgment ? " i thought to myself , but i knew i was guilty of some of that same judgment from time to time			0
it 's not something to be proud of -- those moments , for instance , when you see what a mom is feeding her child and think , " i would never give that to my daughters			1
just writing those words makes me cringe , but they 're real to some extent , and they stem from , i believe , deep insecurities that all moms feel , especially when we compare ourselves to moms around us			2
ca n't we all just get along ? that 's the thinking behind a fabulous photo spread aptly titled " end the @entity57 " on the site @entity59 , which first went viral last year , and continues to pop up			1
women hold signs with messages such as " let 's love more & judge less			1
" hear hear to that ! " the message really resonates with people because ... nobody likes to feel judged , " said @entity65 , 32 , the site 's founder and manager			1
" they 're tired of this negativity			0
" the site made waves in 2012 with a photo spread celebrating women and their post-baby bodies , which got national attention on television			1
as a follow - up , the site launched its campaign for @entity81 , with photos highlighting issues sometimes used to " pit moms against each other , " said @entity65 , mom to a 3 - year - old daughter in @entity87 , @entity88			1
" i work outside the home , " says one woman via a sign			2
next to her , another woman declares , " i 'm a stay - at - home mom			0
" in another , one mom touts she practices " peaceful parenting , " while another mom admits to sometimes yelling at her child			2
" we wanted to take those ( topics ) and say , ' hey , we 're all people			2
we 're all equals , and no one is better than someone else and we do n't know why other people make the decisions that they do , so what 's the point in judging that ? " @entity65 said			1
judgment - free motherhood is a wonderful concept , but i can hear the skeptics now saying it 's about as likely to happen as losing weight by eating daily hot fudge sundaes			2
" it 's a journey for everyone			2
it 's a journey for me			2
i still find myself judging other mothers , " said @entity65 , " but i think the difference is that now when i realize i 'm judging somebody , i realize it and i 'm like , ' ooh , i do n't like the thought i 'm having			0
i 'm going to just not follow that thought and go down a negative mental spiral and instead just remember that every mom is doing the best that ( she ) can			0
' " @entity65 has written about the practical steps moms can take to stop the reflexive judging that we 're all so used to in today 's society			1
" the only thing that we can control is our own mind , " she said			0
" we ca n't control what other people are doing in their life so we can choose to let go of those negative thoughts when we have them and that 's really , i think , the key to becoming a less judgmental person			1
" another way ? listening to other women 's stories and realizing we all have our challenges -- whether we stay at home or work outside the home , breastfeed or formula feed , buy fast food or organic , choose home school or public school or private schools			1
after that disturbing incident at my daughter 's gymnastics class six years ago , i was really helped by an anthology of essays from women from different perspectives , @entity160 's highly regarded " @entity57 "			1
but i have a lot more work to do to truly live judgment - free			0
i 'm inspired to try to do a better job			0
are you ? what do you think is the best way to end the ' mommy wars ' ? share your thoughts in the comments or tell @entity170 on @entity171 or @entity172 on @entity173 .			0
