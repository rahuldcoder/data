@entity0 clung to power in @entity2 for 33 years , navigating -- and even channeling -- the country 's complex tribal power structure			1
rebellions , droughts and crises came and went , but @entity0 never did , deftly playing rivals off each other to rule his fractious land , an act he once called " dancing on the heads of snakes			1
" on wednesday , the 69 - year - old ruler signed an agreement in @entity16 transferring executive powers to the country 's vice president , @entity18			1
although he retains his title as president for up to 90 days , the agreement would appear to end @entity0 's rule after more than three decades			1
born in 1942 in @entity23 to the country 's powerful @entity25 tribe , @entity0 never finished elementary school			1
he joined the army of the former @entity29 at 16 , and five years later was commissioned a second lieutenant in the army of @entity2			0
in 1974 , @entity0 participated in a coup that put a military council in charge of the country , and four years later ascended to the presidency after the previous leader , @entity37 , was assassinated			1
when @entity2 and @entity38 reunited in 1990 , @entity0 became president of the new country and remained in power for the next 21 years , playing tribal rivalries off one another and remaining an ally of the @entity45 despite the lingering presence of @entity47 in the @entity48 in @entity2			1
inspired by protests in @entity51 that forced the country 's president , @entity54 @entity52 , to relinquish power after 23 years , demonstrations spread across the @entity57 and @entity58 , eventually toppling the regimes of @entity61 president @entity60 and @entity63 leader @entity62			1
the protests spread to @entity2 , too , with small demonstrations in january growing larger as the weeks went on			0
they culminated in mass protests calling for @entity0 's resignation despite his promises first to reform the constitution and later assurances that he would step down in 2013 and would not try to transfer power to his son			2
the protests continued into spring and summer , spreading across the country and often resulting in violent clashes with security forces			2
hundreds of protesters died in brutal crackdowns that attracted worldwide attention			0
@entity0 had said since may that he would sign the agreement brokered by the @entity80 that calls for him to step down in exchange for immunity , but repeatedly he balked			2
in june , @entity0 's rule seemed to be at an end when he was injured in an assassination attempt at his palace mosque			2
he traveled to @entity16 to seek medical treatment , leading some to speculate his regime was over			0
but in september , to the surprise of many , he returned to take back the reins of power			0
on wednesday , as he has before , he appeared to reverse course , telling the television station @entity93 24 that he had no more desire to stay in power			0
" whoever hangs onto power i think is crazy , " he told the station			0
but unlike previous meetings with the @entity80 , this time , @entity0 traveled to @entity16 to sign the deal			1
if @entity0 's rule is truly over , it 's unclear what he will do next			2
a presidential source said before the signing that @entity0 will stay in @entity16			1
@entity106 @entity105 ban ki - moon said @entity0 told him he will instead seek medical treatment in @entity108			0
another @entity110 government official said whatever happens is anyone 's guess			0
" everything 's unpredictable with @entity0 , " the official said .			0
