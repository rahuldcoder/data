the @entity0 is waging a battle			1
they want to take back the @entity3 in the 2014 midterms and maintain their majority in the @entity6			0
and one political front is with women			2
in recent years the @entity0 has enjoyed a political advantage with women as more of them have voted for @entity0			1
the @entity11 admits errors leading to success of female @entity0			1
for instance , in the last election , @entity11 candidates , including @entity6 candidate @entity15 , marginalized women by espousing controversial opinions on rape and abortion			1
the situation was so crippling that @entity11 leaders conducted an " autopsy " after the 2012 election to evaluate the party 's shortcomings			1
the image of the white man is something the @entity11 is having trouble breaking			1
voters were reminded of the patrician perception just a couple of weeks ago during the government shutdown when @entity3 @entity11 leaders let the press in a meeting to take pictures as they worked			1
at the long table sat eight men in their shirtsleeves			0
not one woman was present			0
those examples of images and statements make a difference at the voting booth			0
@entity11 presidential candidate @entity48 's nine - point loss among women to president @entity50			1
additionally , of the 81 women members of @entity52 , only 19 are @entity11			1
the story is similar in the @entity6			0
but the @entity0 are n't taking any chances			1
they do n't want to lose their electoral advantage			2

rep. @entity64 of @entity65 , who chairs the @entity66 , on friday unveiled the @entity67 , a new initiative to " target , motivate and mobilize women " to vote and run for office			1

it was rolled out at the 20th anniversary of the @entity66 's @entity84 where @entity86 @entity85 spoke as did @entity87 , president of @entity88			0
republicans are " trying to reach out to women , " @entity64 said in a hotel ballroom full of women activists			2
" is n't that adorable ? " she smirked			0
" outreach is inserting themselves into the most private decisions women make , " she added			2
@entity64 's entire message was n't about beating the @entity11			2
she said that when women sit at the table , they bring solutions			2
" we understand the role of compromise			0
when we 're at the table , government is more responsible , " @entity64 told the audience , referring to the latest gridlock in @entity101 that partially shut down the government			0

the return of @entity105 her goals , however , are still specific : enroll more women into the @entity0			1
@entity11 admit that they have some work to do			1
