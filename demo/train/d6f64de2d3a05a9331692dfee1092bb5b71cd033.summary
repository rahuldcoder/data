@entity1 was a " broken man " following the death of his girlfriend , a psychologist said monday , as the defense used a sentencing hearing to persuade the judge of his fragile emotional state			1
@entity9 said the @entity10 described his girlfriend , @entity11 , as the right person for him			2
but the prosecution slammed her findings , calling them unobjective			2
" we 're dealing with a broken man -- but he 's still alive , " prosecutor @entity15 said in apparent reference to the fact that @entity11 is not			0
" he has lost his love relationship ... but he will be able to love somebody else like that , " @entity15 said			0
the onetime @entity25 sporting hero was found guilty of negligent killing last month in the 2013 death of his girlfriend			1
he returned to court monday for a hearing that will determine whether he 's going to prison			0
judge @entity33 , who presided over his high - profile trial and delivered the verdict last month , will decide his sentence			1
@entity1 was found guilty of culpable homicide , the @entity25 term for unintentionally , but unlawfully , killing a person			1
however , @entity33 cleared him of murder in the killing of @entity11 , a model and law school graduate			1
he was granted bail pending the sentencing hearing			0
the hearing is likely to take several days , as both prosecution and defense will have the chance to put their arguments and evidence before the court			0
there is no legal minimum or maximum sentence for culpable homicide under @entity25 law , so it will be up to the judge to decide			1
a typical sentence is five to eight years			0
but it is a principle of @entity25 law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person , as opposed to the crime			0
that makes predicting a sentence difficult , said @entity67 , a @entity2 legal analyst			1
the judge also found @entity1 guilty of one weapons - related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant			1
the maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars			2
but he could get a lesser sentence , such as a fine or the loss of his gun license			0
it 's likely that a pre-sentence report will be presented to the court , which may recommend a sentence -- although the judge is not bound by it			2
also , both the prosecution and defense probably will tell the court what they consider an appropriate sentence to be			0
prison life ? if @entity1 is sent to prison , it 's not clear whether his disability will allow him any special treatment			1
and daily life behind bars likely would not be easy			0
born with a congenital abnormality , he had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday and uses prosthetic limbs to get around			0
the carbon - fiber blades he used to compete on the track -- before @entity11 's killing abruptly halted his running career -- earned him the nickname " @entity108			2
" during his trial , his defense highlighted his vulnerability when on his stumps , while a court - ordered psychiatric assessment found that he was depressed , suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , and a suicide risk			1
@entity25 's prisons , meanwhile , are notorious for their overcrowding , which puts a strain on sanitation , ventilation and medical care for inmates			0
@entity1 would likely receive far better treatment than the average prisoner , as he has throughout the judicial process , said @entity127 , project coordinator for the @entity129 - based @entity128 , a civil society group			1
even so , she said , it will not make much difference			0
" i do n't think anyone with a disability necessarily will be able to be provided for at the moment in a way that ensures that they would have the correct medical treatment , that they have the correct physical structures , " she said			0
@entity11 was model and law graduate with ' wicked ' sense of humor ' @entity144 was negligent ' @entity1 , 27 , has always admitted firing the bullets that killed his girlfriend @entity11 , 29 , a cover model about to turn reality - tv star			1
he pleaded not guilty to murdering her on @entity150 last year , saying he mistook her for a burglar in his home and the killing was a tragic mistake			2
but in grabbing his gun and heading toward the supposed threat , @entity1 " acted too hastily and used excessive force , " @entity33 ruled last month			1
" his conduct was negligent " and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances -- not even a disabled one , she said			0
defense arguments about his upbringing in a crime - riddled environment might explain his conduct that night , but it does not excuse it , the judge said			1
" the accused had reasonable time to reflect , to think and to conduct himself reasonably , " she said			0
who is ' @entity1 ' @entity1 ? appeals process @entity1 can appeal the verdict or the sentence , potentially to the @entity176 and even eventually to the @entity177			1
the state can appeal only if it believes the judge misinterpreted the law in reaching her verdict			2
the right to appeal depends on whether , based on the facts of the case , the initial judge or magistrate believes a different court could possibly reach a different verdict			2
the @entity177 was once just for cases regarding constitutional matters , but a recent act of @entity25 's @entity192 broadened the court 's responsibilities			0
@entity11 's mother stunned by verdict , wants to meet @entity1 @entity2 's @entity197 contributed to this report .			1

@entity1 will be sentenced by judge @entity33
she cleared him of murder , but found him guilty of culpable homicide
there is no legal minimum or maximum term for culpable homicide
@entity1 will also be sentenced on weapons - related charge for a restaurant shooting
