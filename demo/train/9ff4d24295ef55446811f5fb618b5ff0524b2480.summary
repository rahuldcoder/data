@entity2 taking militants out with drones is n't simple , but it 's the best strategy available to eliminate the threat of terrorists in @entity9 , @entity1 president @entity0 said sunday			1
the administration 's policy in the increasingly unstable country has come under scrutiny in recent days as the @entity1 - backed government crumbled under pressure from @entity18 @entity17 rebels			2
" @entity9 has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , " @entity0 said in @entity2 , where he 's on a three - day state visit			2
he described the @entity1 policy there -- " partnering and intelligence - sharing with that local government " -- as the best approach in a bad situation			1
" the alternative would be for us to play whack - a - mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , " @entity0 said			2
the unraveling security situation in @entity9 -- the same country @entity0 cited as a model for his fight against @entity39 terrorists -- has thrown the president 's counterterror message into question			1
in the capital , @entity44 , last week , the presidential palace was overrun by @entity17 rebels and president @entity47 announced he was resigning			0
that 's a problem for the @entity1 , which has relied on the government in @entity9 as an ally in battling the @entity52 affiliate that 's based there			2
a power vacuum could benefit @entity55 , the terrorist offshoot that @entity1 officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network			0
amid the uncertainty in @entity9 last week , it was reported the @entity1 had suspended its counterterror efforts there			0
@entity0 said definitively on sunday those reports were wrong			0
" we continue to go after high - value targets inside @entity9 , " he said			1
@entity0 himself cited the @entity1 - @entity9 partnership when he announced in september he was going after @entity39 terrorists in @entity67 and @entity68			1
explaining why he was ruling out sending @entity1 troops to fight @entity39 , @entity0 said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in @entity9 and @entity73 to partner with governments to go after terrorists			1
" this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us , while supporting partners on the front lines , is one that we have successfully pursued in @entity9 and @entity73 for years , " @entity0 said on september 10			1
" it is consistent with the approach i outlined earlier this year : to use force against anyone who threatens @entity1 's core interests , but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order			0
" what that strategy relied on , however , was a strong partnership between the @entity1 and the existing government in @entity9 , led by @entity47			2
@entity47 reorganized @entity9 's military to better go after @entity55 , a strategy that worked for a time			0
but the plan was waylaid when resources were diverted to battle the militant @entity17 , a group of @entity18 who say they feel marginalized in the majority @entity102 country			0
@entity0 was confident on sunday that @entity1 anti-terror efforts would continue in @entity9			1
" what we have shown is that we can maintain the kind of pressure on these terrorist networks even in these kind of difficult environments , " he said			0
who 's in charge in @entity9 ?			0

@entity0 says sunday that @entity1 continues to go after " high - value targets inside @entity9 " despite unrest
he says @entity1 drone *strikes* plus partnering with local government are the best approach in a bad situation
in september , @entity0 cited @entity9 as a model for his fight against @entity39 terrorists
