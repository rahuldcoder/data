@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 and @entity6 forces are seeing a marked increase in infiltration into @entity1 from @entity9 by the militant @entity10 , a senior @entity4 official said tuesday			1
there has been a significant increase in the @entity10 's activity in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 provinces which are used in that order as an infiltration route from @entity9 , to launch attacks on the capital , the official said			1
the senior @entity4 official spoke to reporters in @entity0 on the condition no name was used			0
whether or not @entity4 and the @entity6 will have to provide more assistance to the @entity1 security forces , particularly along the border with @entity9 , will depend on " the level of threat coming out of @entity31 " in @entity32 , the official said			1
@entity31 is believed to be where the @entity10 leaders are based			2
@entity10 fighters are blamed for killing more than 1,000 coalition and @entity1 forces			1
the official said @entity10 militants were behind a series of " spectacular attacks , " this summer , including a 20 - hour attack on the @entity43 , last month , and an assault on @entity0 's @entity45 , in june , which left at least a dozen people dead			1
@entity4 officials said there had also been a marked increase in the number of cross border attacks from @entity9 , but the insisted reports of artillery bombardments and heavy casualties were often exaggerated			2
@entity56 troops respond to all reports by deploying surveillance assets , usually helicopters and drones , but they often can not find evidence of structural damage or the craters consistent with the villagers ' accounts of sustained artillery and rocket bombardments , the official explained			0
the official said @entity56 's primary objective is sharing this information with @entity1 and @entity9 officials as quickly as possible to diffuse cross-border tensions			1
both sides have agreed , within the last ten days , to set up a working group for investigating future allegations			0
part of the problem is that insurgents have reoccupied safe havens inside @entity1 , which became much more attractive following the @entity6 withdrawal from remote bases in @entity82 and @entity83 provinces , coupled with increased pressure on the @entity9 side of the border , said the official			1
while most of the cross-border attacks are launched by insurgents , he said there is legitimate confusion as to where the border lies			0
" we 'll get the maps out and there will be differences of multiples of kilometers of where they think the border is , " the official said			0
gen. @entity99 , the commander of @entity6 and @entity4 forces in @entity1 , has completed a compressed 90 - day assessment and revision of the campaign plan and , contrary to earlier suggestions that there would be an abrupt shift of focus to the east of the country , he concluded that he wants to continue building on progress in the south , while keeping @entity0 and its environs secure , eventually linking the two areas via @entity1 's ring road , the official told reporters			1
" as things improve in the south we will focus more on the east , " the official said			2
" our progress is incremental , but it is progress , " the official said			0
" we have physically taken away their safe havens [ in the south ] , and they wo n't get them back			0
" in the east , the focus will be on @entity0 and the surrounding provinces , particularly @entity18 and @entity16 , which are being used to launch attacks on the capital , the official said			0
" the other issue is the harder one , that 's the sense of security in the minds of the @entity1 people ...			2
do the @entity1 people feel any more secure ? no , not yet			2
" the military is proving the space for the @entity1 government , but the government remains deeply unpopular and corrupt , the official said			1
areas likely to be slated for transition in the upcoming second tranche include the @entity142 ( capital of @entity142 province @entity144 ( the capital of @entity18 ) , and @entity145 , in @entity146			0
@entity82 is likely to be at least a year away .			0
