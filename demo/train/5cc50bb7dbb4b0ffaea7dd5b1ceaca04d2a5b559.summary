-- the $ 10,000 prize caught @entity3 's attention			1
he read the rules carefully			2
teams of five would compete against others from around the country to have the highest percentage of weight loss after 12 weeks			1
to prevent unhealthy dieting , no one person could lose more than 16.6 % of their total body weight			1
@entity3 was n't extremely obese , but he had put on more than a few pounds since getting married and starting law school			2
his family was naturally competitive			2
if he could persuade them to participate , he thought , they had a good chance of winning the @entity21 challenge			1
he talked to his uncle , @entity23 , and his sister , who had auditioned for " @entity25 " but were not accepted			2
they agreed to join his team			0
his mom and dad also hopped on board			0
the family decided on a name -- " will work for @entity33 " -- and paid their $ 75 entry fees			1
for three months , they cut out sugar and refined carbohydrates ; they avoided eating late at night and added exercise to their schedules			1
they vied for first place with a team named @entity47 , winning and losing small challenges along the way that only pushed them harder			2
" in general , i 'm a warrior , " @entity23 says			0
and as a warrior , " you 're never quite happy with just being ahead -- you want to be way ahead			0
" can you smell obesity ? in the end , they emerged victorious -- dropping a combined 255 pounds ( 16 % of their total body weight ) to win the competition and the $ 10,000 prize			1
" it 's been nice to have it off -- to be able to fit into your old clothes , feel comfortable in groups , " says @entity3 , who lost 47 pounds			0
" @entity23 used his share of the winnings to put a new motor in his old @entity67			0
but the real benefits were less materialistic -- his cholesterol went down , his blood pressure normalized and his acid reflux disappeared			0
" my son the other day got my wallet and pulled out my driver 's license picture ... he looked at it and looked at my wife and said , ' that does n't look like @entity81 anymore , ' " @entity23 said with a laugh			0
@entity3 and @entity23 have joined another @entity21 challenge to continue their weight loss journey			1
the company offers three programs			0
the @entity88 challenge asks teams of five to compete for $ 10,000 ; the 10 % @entity90 allows users to double their money if they lose 10 % of their weight in six months ; and the @entity90 pays users $ 100 to go from an obese @entity90 to a healthy @entity90 in 12 months			1
@entity21 is n't the only company to jump on the motivation money train			1
competitors such as @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 ask users to put their hard - earned cash on the line in hopes of getting healthy and wealthy			2
and many company benefits programs have started offering financial incentives to employees who drop weight or quit smoking in hopes of reducing health care costs			1
would you lose weight if money were at stake ? there 's scientific evidence to support their business model			1
@entity21 co-founder @entity119 started the company in 2009 after seeing a study in the @entity122 that showed financial incentives could encourage weight loss			1
last year , a @entity129 study found people who received financial incentives stuck with healthy behaviors longer -- losing , on average , seven more pounds than their colleagues whose wallets were n't linked to weight loss			1
of course , money is n't the only motivator in weight loss challenges			1
" i think what inspired me the most was the fact that my team members were going to lose money , " @entity3 says			1
" i was really afraid i would be the person that ruined it for everyone			0
" peer pressure can help groups lose more weight than individuals fighting for a cash prize , according to a new study published in the journal @entity150			1
researchers followed two groups of employees at the @entity154			0
individuals in the first group were offered $ 100 each month that they met or exceeded their weight loss goals			1
the second group was organized into teams of five ; each team was given $ 500 to split among those who met their goals , increasing the competition between team members			1
people in the second group lost almost three times as much weight than those in the first , according to the study			2
" we 've found a lot of success among teams where you already know your teammates , " @entity119 says			2
" people are more motivated by not letting their team down than they are by doing it for themselves			0
" the company has also identified other key factors that lead to effective weight loss			2
" a really big headline number is important , " @entity119 says			0
" 100 bucks , 200 , 400 , is not going to move the needle with behavior change			0
but if you say you can win $ 10,000 ... " trainer : dumbbells and diets do n't get you in shape also important is having a stake in the competition			1
people who make an investment -- such as paying $ 150 up front -- are more motivated by losing that money than by doubling it , @entity119 says			1
of course , not everyone has a competitive personality			0
men tend to do better on @entity21 than women , he notes , and the website attracts more users who are " money motivated " -- coupon clippers or discount shoppers who value the return on their investment			1
" it 's so personal , " @entity119 says of weight loss			2
" different people have different motivations			0
" right now @entity21 is " one size fits all , " he says			1
but in the future , the company hopes to provide customized programs that will fit each person 's needs , whether that 's a bigger prize , a shorter time period or weekly incentives			0
it 's tough , @entity3 says , to stay on track without the proper motivation			0
" once you get to where you are you miss what you had before			0
food is a big temptation			0
" he 's joined the @entity90 in hopes of getting down to 180 pounds and doubling his initial investment			0
@entity23 joined another matchup team challenge with his wife , @entity232 , after the first ; they took fourth place			0
now he 's participating in the 10 % challenge to lose 10 % of his body weight in six months			1
he does n't track calories , focusing instead on eating five to six small healthy meals a day			0
he hits the gym for an hour to two hours most days and takes his kids , @entity241 , 6 , and @entity242 , 2 , out to ride bikes or swim at the pool			2
since june 2012 , when he first joined @entity21 , he 's lost 128 pounds			1
" i 'm still getting there , " he says			0
" part of it is time ; part of it is understanding what really matters in life			0
... as you start to have kids , suddenly you come to the realization that there ( are ) more people depending on you than yourself			0
