it is no secret that the @entity2 did not initially support @entity4 's campaign to become president of the @entity6			1
during the 2008 primary campaign , half of the members backed then - sen. @entity10			2
it was not until the @entity13 caucus win by @entity4 that many black @entity6 started to believe it was possible for a black man to become president			1
and even once it was clear that @entity4 could win , some @entity2 members were still skeptical			1
fast forward to this year			0
the black caucus and most of black @entity6 ( with the exception of @entity21 and @entity22 ) had remained silent for two years about the devastating economic impact of the recession on black people			1
they did so out of fear that to criticize this president would hurt his standing as the nation 's first black commander in chief			1
but finally this summer , the @entity2 , led by rep. @entity32 , @entity33 , took off the gloves and broke its silence through a series of national town hall forums			0
@entity38 said she was concerned that the president 's jobs tour " did not include any black cities			1
" she further indicated that the black caucus wanted to put pressure on @entity4 , but could not , due to the fact that black people " love the president			1
" she said the caucus also " loves the president , " but lamented , " we are getting tired			1
" waters ended by asking the audience , " will you unleash us ? let us know when to let go , and we will let go			0
" at the @entity55 , there was dismay about how to respond to this attack from its most loyal base of supporters			0
finally , the @entity55 started a blitz of interviews on black media			2
although the president and his staff steered away from using the word " black , " they made clear that they heard the @entity2 's message and were working diligently to change course			1
all seemed well , that is until saturday night at the 41st annual @entity70 dinner in @entity71 , where the president told the attendees , " i expect all of you to march with me and press on			2
take off your bedroom slippers , put on your marching shoes			0
stop complaining , stop grumbling , stop crying			1
we are going to press on			0
we 've got work to do , @entity2			0
" taking the president 's comments in context , it is clear that he directed his ire at his critics			2
some say he was offering a " tough love " rebuke , rallying the troops to get up and act			0
but the reality is that black @entity6 is in a crisis that civil rights icon @entity92 last week called " the worst since slavery			0
" the president made clear his dismay with such criticisms during a monday night @entity99 interview when asked by a reporter why he does n't " target black @entity6 specifically for economic relief			1
" @entity4 responded , " @entity6 does n't work that way			2
" others have questioned the president 's choice of words at the @entity2 dinner and asked , " who is complaining ? " their take is that they are standing up for those who can not stand up for themselves and that they are pushing a black agenda as others have pushed their own agendas			1
the president would never speak in such a manner to the @entity118 , which has pushed him very aggressively on immigration reform and now has a @entity121 justice on the nation 's high court			2
nor would he address our gay brethren in such a manner as they pushed hard for a repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " and now want the @entity128 reversed			0
how about our @entity130 brothers and sisters ? would he tell them to stand down on their views of the @entity137 - @entity136 conflict , or stop lobbying hard for @entity139 policies ? never			0
for reasons beyond my understanding , the audience at the @entity2 that heard this rebuke cheered the president			0
but those of us who are journalists would be wrong not to question why black @entity6 is so willing to tolerate such openly unbalanced treatment when other groups would never accept it			0
so the deeper question is not why president @entity4 took the tone he did , but why black @entity6 tolerates it			1
@entity4 seemed to be asking black @entity6 once again to keep the faith -- to " press on " and to " shake it off			1
" ok -- but how do you shake off poverty ? how do you keep the faith when you are unemployed and can not feed your kids ? how do you press on when you have no health care , no home , and no hope ? i too like this president			0
i voted for him in 2008 , and his candidacy led me to leave the @entity166 to become an independent			0
but i think the time has come for the administration to " take its slippers off " and march into @entity6 's urban centers and rural centers , and create a sustainable and real - time jobs policy -- going beyond the president 's jobs bill -- that will touch everyday black @entity6 who are out of work and economically disenfranchised			1
that is not too much to ask , and it is not showing favoritism to one group over others			0
the cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks , so it is proper and necessary for the @entity2 and others to continue to press this president to do more .			2
