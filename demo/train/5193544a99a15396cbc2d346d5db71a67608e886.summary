a divided @entity0 , debating wednesday whether public prayers at a @entity3 's board meetings are permissible , looked at the country 's history of religious acknowledgment in the legislature and the court 's own traditions			1
two local women brought suit against @entity12 , @entity13 , officials , objecting that the monthly public sessions on government open with invocations they say have been overwhelmingly @entity18 in nature over the years			1
the hour of sharp oral arguments presented another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena			0
the court 's conservative majority appeared to have the votes to allow the policy to continue in some form , but both sides expressed concerns about the level of judicial and government oversight over the content presented by members of a particular faith			1
" we are a very religiously diverse country , " said justice @entity38 , who worried about the town officials articulating binding guidelines on what can be said			2
" all should be treated equally			0
so i ca n't see how you can compose a prayer that is acceptable to all these " religions			2
but justice @entity47 worried about the effect on local citizens who choose not to stand and bow their heads when asked during a public prayer			2
" you think any of those people would n't feel coerced to stand ? " the high court began its public session wednesday as it has for decades , with the marshal invoking a traditional statement that ends , " @entity58 save the @entity59 and this honorable court			1
" the town of about 94,000 residents outside @entity63 began allowing prayers to start its meetings in 1999 , after years of having a " moment of silence			1
" co-plaintiffs @entity67 and @entity68 challenged the revised policy , saying officials repeatedly ignored their requests to modify or eliminate the practice , or at least make it more inclusive			0
" it 's very divisive when you bring government into religion , " @entity67 told @entity74 from her home			0
" i do n't believe in @entity58 , and @entity68 is @entity80 , so to hear these ministers talk about @entity82 and even have some of them who personally question our motives , it 's just not appropriate			1
" @entity88 gets her day at the @entity0 the town government counters that after concerns from the two women and others , it sought diverse voices , including a wiccan priestess , to offer invocations			1
officials say they do not review the content of the remarks , nor censor any language			0
" the faith of the prayer giver does not matter at all , " said @entity100 , @entity12 's board supervisor , who began the practice shortly after taking office 1998			1
" we accept anyone who wants to come in and volunteer to give the prayer to open up our town meetings			1
" a federal appeals court in @entity13 found the board 's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the @entity114 's @entity113 , which forbids any government " endorsement " of religion			1
those judges said it had the effect of " affiliating the town with @entity18			1
" @entity123 and state legislatures regularly open their sessions with a prayer			1
the question in part before the court is whether local government bodies are different , in that there might be more active involvement with the local citizenry , who may want to personally petition the town in zoning , tax , and other matters			1
but after the " oyez " intonation by marshal @entity138 -- a rite introduced by chief justice @entity140 in the early 19th century -- to kick off the high court session , justice @entity136 explored the limits of permissible government action by making the issue more personal			1
she asked whether the court could suddenly invite a @entity18 minister to invoke the following prayer , inside the ornate marbled courtroom : ' we acknowledge the saving sacrifice of @entity82 on the cross			1
' " would that be permissible ? " asked @entity136			0
@entity152 , attorney for @entity12 , suggested courts are different , and that the national legislature had done similar prayers since the nation 's founding			1
" whatever line might be drawn between non-legislative bodies and legislative bodies , " he said , " it would be incongruous , if @entity123 could have legislative prayers and the states could n't			1
" but the lawyer for the women , supported by @entity166 , said that unlike most legislatures , there was no official policy on prayers in @entity12			1
" the policy should give guidelines to chaplains that say : stay away from points in which believers are known to disagree , " said @entity175			0
" and we think the town should do what it can to ameliorate coercion			2
it should tell the clergy : do n't ask people to physically participate			0
that 's the most important thing			0
" that was when some on the court began to have doubts about when and to what extent lawmakers -- and later courts -- should be advising various faiths what to say , and parsing what is sectarian and not in the language			2
" give me an example of a prayer that is acceptable to all of the groups that i mentioned , " said @entity38			2
he had included @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
when @entity175 suggested something like , " the prayers to the almighty , prayers to the creator , " @entity38 and others were unconvinced , saying polytheists might object			2
" what about devil worshippers ? " asked justice @entity209 , bringing laughter to the courtroom			0
" well , if devil worshippers believe the devil is the almighty , they might be ok with it , " responded @entity175 , smiling			0
town prayers need less @entity82 , more @entity220 " who was supposed to make these determinations ? is there supposed to be an officer of the town council that will review ? " asked chief justice @entity223			1
" do prayers have to be reviewed for his approval in advance ? " justice @entity230 , who may prove the decisive , or " swing , " vote in this petition , was especially vocal			2
" it just seems to me that enforcing that standard involves the state very heavily in the censorship and the approval or disapproval of prayers , " he said			2
" i 'm serious about this			0
this involves government very heavily in religion			0
" he also suggested small towns deserve as much right to allow a brief prayer in public sessions as elsewhere			2
" in a way it sounds quite elitist to say , well , now , we can do this in @entity254 and @entity255 and @entity256 , @entity257 , but you people up there in @entity12 ca n't do that			1
" several members of @entity123 were in attendance for the argument , including sen. @entity264 , a @entity266 @entity265			1
" every day before the @entity269 meets , the @entity269 chaplain comes out and gives a prayer , and that 's important to us , " @entity264 told @entity74 just after arguments ended			2
" it 's part of our country 's tradition ; it 's also our constitutional right , to be able to exercise that			0
and i thought it was important to defend that here today			0
" nearly 120 members of @entity123 , mostly @entity265 , along with 18 state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city			1
the @entity282 administration is doing the same			0
but the two plaintiffs , who were also watching in the courtroom , said they have faced harassment from their community and even vandalism of their property			0
" the pastors face the people , they do n't face the town government , so it 's like they 're praying over us , " @entity68 told @entity74 after the argument			1
" when they all stood and i sat , and i have a hundred eyes looking at me , and questioning what 's going on , they think i 'm being disrespectful			0
it does put a lot of pressure on you and it makes you very uncomfortable			0
it singles you out , and that should n't be in my town government , and it should n't be anywhere			2
" the high court has generally taken a case - by - case approach on determining just when the state intrudes unconstitutionally into religion , while generally allowing faith to be acknowledged in a limited basis in a public forum			1
" @entity324 " remains on currency ; the @entity317 and oaths of office mention a creator ; and menorah and creche displays are permitted in local parks			0
but the justices acknowledge the tricky line they must walk -- politically , socially , legally -- when deciding @entity113 appeals			0
" it 's hard because the ( @entity0 ) @entity0 lays down these rules and everybody thinks that the court is being hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and agitated , " said @entity136 near the end of the argument			1
" part of what we are trying to do here is to maintain a multi-religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way			0
and every time the court gets involved in things like this , it seems to make the problem worse rather than better			0
" the case is @entity12 , @entity348 v. @entity68 ( 12 - 696 )			2
a ruling is expected by early summer			0
