-- @entity1 , the high - profile electronics company that builds @entity3 's @entity2 and other products in @entity5 , is back in the headlines after workers rioted at its @entity9 factory			1
@entity1 has attracted attention in the past for poor working conditions and a series of employee suicides			0
@entity15 , one of the factory workers , told @entity17 that " the guards here use gangster style to manage			2
we are not against following rules , but you have to tell us why			0
they wo n't explain things , and we feel like we can not communicate with them			0
" on friday , a labor rights group reported that @entity1 workers had gone on strike over production demands for the @entity2 ; the company denied there was a strike			0
although employees at @entity3 and @entity1 are treated very differently , the two companies are known for keeping their workers and others in the dark			1
yet both are enormously successful , causing many people to question whether the popular management advice in favor of " openness " actually makes business sense			1
i was reminded of this when speaking at this year 's @entity48 conference			0
the conference 's theme was radical openness , an idea i helped develop a number of years ago in a book i co-authored entitled " the @entity55			1
" my talk argued that openness has several meanings , and for each there is a corresponding principle			0
one meaning of openness refers to transparency , with a company making available pertinent information to stakeholders such as customers , employees , business partners and shareholders			1
i believe companies can often benefit from being more transparent with these groups			1
@entity48 : the self - organizing computer course another meaning of openness applies to the sharing of intellectual assets			0
i believe a company can benefit by sharing some of its intellectual property given the right conditions			0
in the subsequent discussion on @entity48 , some challenged my thesis by citing @entity3			1
how could i explain the company 's success , since it is known for the shroud of secrecy within which it operates ? but when you look closely at @entity3 , a different picture emerges			1
@entity3 has become more open in a number of areas , and the pressures of the market forces i describe are forcing it to open up even further			1
transparency to begin , @entity3 is more transparent than one might think			1
like all companies it has four major stakeholders : customers , employees , business partners and shareholders			1
@entity3 is obviously super-secretive with its customers about product announcements			1
and at the moment it can get away with this behavior because it so powerful in the niche markets in which it operates , and it has a small array of products			0
but as it tries to expand its share of the corporate market , business customers will demand to be well briefed regarding @entity3 's intentions and its product road maps			1
@entity113 is a good example of this			0
the struggling company is forced to share details about its upcoming @entity119 platform			0
it hopes to release the product early next year , and it is trying feverishly to pump up the buzz around the software to encourage its customers to stay loyal and developers to make apps			1
and as @entity3 continues to lag well behind @entity127 in market share , eventually it will be forced to be more open with consumers , as well			1
@entity48 : the currency of the new economy is trust @entity3 's customers are n't alone in being kept in the dark ; the company treats its employees the same way			1
the vast majority of them have few details about what is in the company 's product pipeline			0
but such opacity does not derive from some inherent benefits of closed work systems			0
rather it is purely in aid of ensuring secrecy of its product strategy with customers			0
@entity3 does n't want its workers leaking information to the media or blogosphere			1
but increasingly @entity3 pays a price for this employee secrecy			2
it does n't get the serendipitous collaboration across company silos that many other businesses enjoy			0
that among other things could have prevented the premature release of defective mapping software on the @entity2			0
think of @entity166 and how its workers are encouraged to dream up new products			0
in terms of its supply chain , @entity3 itself has huge transparency and visibility			2
it can see down through @entity1 all the way to suppliers two levels below			0
true , this visibility had not extended to the rest of the world , but in this age of transparency @entity3 can no longer keep its supply chain practices secret			2
as a result , everyone knows about @entity1 's labor relations and how its factories are run under tight security and employees are treated and compensated poorly			0
this is an enormous problem for @entity3 , not just for its reputation , but also the disruptions such working conditions can cause in the supply chain			2
so as @entity3 becomes naked it is being forced to get buff -- to clean up its supply chain practices			2
( in march , a report on working conditions at @entity1 by auditors from the @entity197 , a watchdog group hired by @entity3 , found serious violations of worker rights and salaries too low to cover living expenses			2
@entity1 promised to improve conditions , and @entity3 said " we think empowering workers and helping them understand their rights is essential			2
" ) as for transparency with its shareholders , @entity3 is actually very open -- respected as being one of the best companies on the planet for providing shareholders with pertinent information			1
the only area in which it had been faulted is whether it had been sufficiently candid about @entity215 's declining health			0
sharing paradoxically @entity3 's success is largely due to another kind of openness			1
the @entity2 or @entity220 are nice pieces of hardware , but that 's not what created their market success			0
but by opening up what are called " application programming interfaces " @entity3 has enabled its customers and the world of software developers to build apps on its platform			1
in this sense @entity3 's corporate borders are quite open and porous			1
it is a design and marketing company at the heart of an enormous business web of suppliers and software developers -- based on openness			1
@entity48 : the future of business is " the mesh " to be sure , @entity3 is obsessed with guarding its intellectual property and has sought refuge in outmoded intellectual property laws and in courts that today stifle innovation in our economy			1
but increasingly this comes at a cost , too			0
@entity127 , the open - source software platform developed by @entity166 , quickly became the dominant operating system in the mobile marketplace			2
open - source software stimulates creativity and attracts attention , and over time openness tends to win out in the market			1
@entity166 was smart to release the @entity127 software 's inner workings so that manufacturers could tweak the operating system to their specific devices			0
other companies have made equally smart moves			0
@entity267 gave away $ 400 million worth of software to the open - source @entity270 movement and in exchange received billions of dollars in savings and new business			1
@entity3 also has failed miserably in terms of sharing within society and the global community			2
it is sitting on $ 100 billion in cash but during the @entity280 era made little effort to be a good corporate citizen and reach out to the larger community			0
it has long provided lower - cost computers to schools and universities , but purely as a marketing strategy , and otherwise has done little to help @entity289 's education system			0
it has been a philanthropic miser and has declined to take part in important social partnerships			0
@entity48 : the new open - source economics with @entity294 now having been ceo for a year , @entity3 seems to be increasingly aware that in the long term , business can not succeed in a world that 's failing			1
it has started to make more donations and is joining social causes , which will prove popular with its customers , especially with young people who increasingly want to do business with companies that behave well			1
in fact , @entity3 should consider taking a large portion of its $ 100 billion and applying it to transforming some important institutions like education			2
such a bold move would benefit everyone , including shareholders , and @entity3 could be positioned to dominate some important emerging markets			2
@entity3 became the world 's most valuable company for a number of complex reasons , including the design genius of its brilliant founder			2
but when you look under the surface , it is more open than you might think , and there is no real evidence that its secrecy has helped it succeed			0
and increasingly as it comes under more intense competitive pressures , @entity3 will need to become an even more open company			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity327 .			2

@entity327 : @entity3 seems like an *exception* to idea that openness helps companies
he says @entity3 is more open than many people realize , and it is becoming more transparent
@entity3 guards its software but has opened interface to app developers
@entity327 : @entity3 has to open further as it expands offerings to business customers
