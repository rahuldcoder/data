the @entity1 , @entity2 , police chief insisted thursday that he wo n't step down -- despite continued unrest months after one of his officer 's fatally shot @entity6 and high - level talks that could lead to his exit			1
" i 'm going to stay and see this through , " chief @entity9 told @entity10			1
the firestorm around @entity9 began august 9 , when officer @entity13 , who is white , shot @entity6 , an @entity15 - @entity14 teen			1
@entity13 's defenders have said he acted in self - defense , while @entity6 's backers note the teenager was n't armed and claim he had his hands up when the fatal bullets hit him			1
the incident roused large and , at times , violent demonstrations in @entity1			2
@entity9 faced criticism over his department 's handling of the @entity6 shooting and the subsequent protests			1
government officials say that @entity9 's future is part of talks involving local , state and congressional officials			1
part of that discussion centers on what severance package the chief might get , as well as who would manage the @entity1 police department instead of him			1
whether the chief wants it or not , the collective decision has been made that the @entity1 police will move ahead without him , according to the officials			1
all sides taking part in the talks had hoped @entity9 would be able to step down on his own accord , instead of being forced out			1
but @entity9 gave no indication thursday that he 'll leave voluntarily , saying he plans to stay as long as the city manager and council support him			1
" i certainly have the support of the police department and the community			0
i have a lot of support in the community , " he said			0
" i think this is my job to complete , and i 'm going to do it			0
" the situation in @entity1 remains unsettled			2
@entity13 's fate is up in the air : he has n't been charged , though a grand jury is hearing evidence and will determine whether to indict him			0
and activists have n't shown any sign they 're ready to give up in pushing for @entity13 's prosecution and other , broader changes in @entity1			1
amid it all , @entity9 says that " this happened on my watch , and i intend to see it through , " he told @entity10			2
" i think i 'm very capable of doing that , and i have a lot of people behind me that believe so as well			2
" investigation the @entity80 is investigating @entity1 police			2
investigators are looking at the department 's use of force over the years ; analyzing stops , searches and arrests ; and examining the treatment of people detained at the city jail , @entity14 attorney general @entity82 has said			1
@entity82 has said the @entity80 's investigation includes the department 's leadership			2
some officials have expressed a desire to dissolve the entire department and turn over law enforcement to @entity101 police			2
complete coverage of @entity1 shooting and protests " we 're looking at a whole variety of things , including the leadership of that department , the practices that the department engages in , the nature of the interaction between the department and the community that it is supposed to serve , " @entity82 said			1
@entity82 has declined to comment on whether the police chief should be removed , but he has not been shy about expressing his views			0
" it 's pretty clear that the need for wholesale change is appropriate , " he said this month			0
@entity9 has found fault with @entity82 's remarks			1
" he 's drawn a conclusion that wholesale change needs to be made , " said @entity9			1
" we have a lot of good stuff going on , so i think he needs to be a little more specific			0
" the police chief also defended the handling of the sometimes violent protests in the wake of the shooting			2
" there was firebombs thrown			0
there were shots fired , for several nights in a row , shots fired at police officers and vehicles			0
and through all of that , the tactics that were used resulted in no injuries to any protesters or police officers			0
so , that 's actually something to be quite happy about , " @entity9 said			1
apology last month , @entity9 released a video apology directed at @entity6 's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to @entity1 's streets to protest the teen 's death			1
in particular , he apologized that his department left @entity6 's body in the street for four hours after the shooting , and for his department 's failure to protect the demonstrators ' right to assemble			1
he acknowledged that the incident had sparked a larger conversation about societal issues , saying @entity1 and the surrounding areas have " much work to do			2
" " overnight , i went from being a small - town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation			2
as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation			0
i also want to be part of the solution , " he said			0
" for any mistakes i 've made , i take full responsibility			0
it 's an honor to serve the city of @entity1 and the people who live there			1
i look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems , and once again , i deeply apologize to the @entity6 family , " he said			1
later that day , he waded into a crowd at a protest and apologized again			0
some people seemed satisfied by his apologies , but not everyone was eager to hear from him			0
one man shouted into a bullhorn , " if you are not resigning tonight , go home			0
" what 's next ? part of why he wants to stay , @entity9 said , is because he finds it painful to watch what 's happening in his community			1
he said he wants to help heal it			0
although the department has done a lot around the issue , police need to work harder on minority recruitment and retention , the chief said			2
@entity1 is a predominantly black community with a mostly white police force			0
at the time of @entity6 's shooting , only three of the city 's 53 officers were african - american			1
police can also put more of an emphasis on community - oriented policing and problem - solving , @entity9 said			0
asked whether those sort of changes will be enough to restore calm , the chief replied : " what 's enough is sort of dependent on what 's the right thing to do , and that 's what i 'm focused on			0
" but he knows the issue is much bigger than one person			0
" i 'm just one of the players			0
this is going to take the entire community , " @entity9 said .			0

officials : there 's a collective decision @entity1 will move on without @entity9
