@entity0 -- the plot sounds like something plucked from today 's headlines : foreign hostages , terrorism , presidential power and @entity9 diplomatic relations with the @entity10			1
but the nation 's first war on terror was waged by @entity14 , not @entity15 or @entity16			1
in place of @entity18 or @entity19 , @entity14 was fighting the barbary pirates			1
in @entity14 's time , @entity22 powers conceded to terrorism by paying annual tribute and ransom to groups like the barbary pirates , according to @entity29 , co-founder of the @entity30 and professor of @entity32			1
once the @entity9 colonies gained independence from @entity37 , their ships were left without protection from piracy at sea			0
as @entity9 commerce began to increase , the @entity41 targeted @entity9 merchant vessels that traveled the seas without a strong naval defense			0
ransom payments @entity14 believed paying ransom to terrorist organizations was a sign of weakness as a nation			0
" some leaders wanted to pay ransom to get hostages back or pay tribute so they [ barbary pirates ] would n't take further hostages , " @entity29 said			2
" @entity14 was a lover of peace , but he was not one to believe that peace would be preserved by weakness			0
we had to show strength			0
" in 1801 , pirates across the coast of @entity63 continued to seize @entity9 ships and use force to take @entity9 hostage			2
" @entity14 learned of how brutally @entity68 prisoners were being held			0
they were kept in chains , dungeons , their life span was not long , and a lot of them were dying in prison , " @entity29 said			0
the pirates of @entity63 declared war on the @entity9 in may 1801 , according to a chapter written by @entity29 and published in the @entity80			2
even before his presidency , @entity14 , as secretary of state , argued that his nation should not offer money to terrorists			0
it 's a principle that persists in @entity9 's battle against @entity19			1
today , 62 % of @entity9 oppose paying ransom to @entity19 , according to a @entity91 - @entity90 poll of 4,685 @entity9 adults			2
the @entity9 government paid ransom to free @entity97 sgt. @entity96 from the @entity98 , but if those type of negotiations are being held with @entity19 , it has not been made public			2
@entity19 seems to be making a statement with its hostages			0
congressional vote in a recent address to the nation , @entity16 told the @entity9 people that we will " degrade and ultimately destroy @entity19			1
" even though he said he did n't need it , he asked for @entity110 ' vote of approval			0
in the meantime , @entity16 ordered military strikes against @entity19 in @entity114 and @entity115			1
a survey released by @entity1 indicates " more than seven in 10 @entity9 think @entity16 should ask @entity110 for the ability to strike @entity19 militarily			1
and eight in 10 @entity9 support @entity110 approving military force against @entity19			2
" but @entity110 has left @entity0 to prepare for midterm elections , so any special authority will come after the fact			0
in 1801 , @entity14 sent a similar message to the @entity9 people			2
without congressional approval , @entity29 said , @entity14 sent a small squadron of ships to the @entity126 to battle the barbary pirates			1
@entity14 ordered naval leaders to " protect our commerce and chastise their insolence -- by sinking , burning or destroying their ships and vessels wherever you shall find them , " according to @entity9 naval documents			2
the first time @entity110 was officially notified of @entity14 's plan , which deployed two - thirds of @entity9 's naval forces into battle with the enemy , was after the fact , in his first annual message to @entity110 on december 8 , 1801			1
" @entity14 's belief was that when war is declared against the @entity9 we do n't need @entity110 ' approval to fight back , " said @entity29			1
in @entity14 's address to @entity110 he wrote that , " unauthorized by the @entity149 , without the sanction of @entity110 , to go out beyond the line of defense , " he deployed @entity9 naval forces into battle			1
boots on the ground with such a strong and pressing enemy threatening the @entity9 , @entity14 eventually sent @entity9 naval forces into harm 's way to fight			1
" i 'm a believer			0
i think we ought to be looking for a way to be getting their [ @entity19 ' ] attention			0
it was a widely held opinion to send ships to the @entity126 , during @entity14 's presidency , because everyone thought , wow , this is outrageous what they 're doing to us , " @entity29 said			0
today , @entity16 faces the pressures of not putting @entity9 troops on the ground in @entity114 and @entity115			1
while 76 % favor @entity9 airstrikes against @entity19 , 61 % of @entity9 oppose putting @entity9 soldiers on the ground in @entity114 and @entity115 , according to a poll released by @entity1 earlier this month			1
the fight against terror is nothing new for the @entity9			0
with many similarities dating back to the early 1800s , today @entity16 has vital decisions to make			0
although the president 's strategy to defeat @entity19 is gradually emerging , @entity9 's ability to grow as a nation emanates from the valuable lessons the country learned so early in its existence .			1

president @entity16 launched strikes on @entity19 in @entity115 without congressional approval
@entity14 launched war on the barbary pirates without congressional approval
the conflict over protecting shipping routes was @entity9 's first war on terror
