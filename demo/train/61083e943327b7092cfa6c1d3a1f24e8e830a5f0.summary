-- the @entity1 on thursday denied the state attorney general 's attempt to have it reconsider its assent to controversial pardons -- several of them for convicted killers -- issued earlier this year by outgoing gov. @entity7			1
the decision was made " without comment , " court spokeswoman @entity8 said by e-mail			1
attorney general @entity12 has been a harsh and persistent critic of the 214 pardons and clemencies issued by @entity7 in january , shortly before the governor left office			1
besides questioning whether some convicted of violent crimes should so easily walk free , he has argued some of the pardons were invalid because they did not meet a state constitutional requirement that notices be filed each day for 30 days in newspapers based where the crimes were committed			2
but @entity24 courts have consistently upheld the pardons			1
the state @entity1 was among them , ruling in march that @entity7 had complete power to pardon and his authority could not be challenged			2
in a statement afterward , @entity7 said the decision " reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state , " but acknowledged that his pardons have been difficult for those who themselves or had family members victimized by those who went free			2
@entity12 , a @entity38 , did n't give up his legal fight after that decision			0
in a brief filed with the state 's high court later in march , he argued the case should be reheard because the " private personal rights " of the victims , as provided by the state constitution and @entity49 ' @entity48 , were violated by the pardons			1
@entity7 , who also is former chairman of the @entity50 , has said that he believes in redemption and that people deserve second chances			0
most of the pardons involved convicts who had already served their time and have since been released from prison for their crimes , but four were convicted murderers who had worked as " trusties " at the governor 's mansion			0
victims ' families have denounced the former governor for not meeting with them to discuss his reasons why he would show such leniency to these men			0
they included relatives of @entity71 , who was gunned down by @entity72 in 1993 as she held her 6 - week - old son			0
other convicted killers who , like @entity72 , received full pardons and were named in @entity12 's brief include @entity77 , who was convicted in a 1991 murder , and @entity79 , convicted in a 2001 murder			1
@entity0 's @entity81 contributed to this report .			0
