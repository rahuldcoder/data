@entity0 , @entity1 -- a skydiver 's historic free - fall from the stratosphere was called off tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record - breaking attempt			1
another attempt is not expected before thursday due to weather conditions			1
@entity13 is aiming to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet ( about 23 miles ) , more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner -- with nothing but a space suit , helmet and parachute			1
he also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier in such a dive			1
at that altitude , the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds , he is expected to be free - falling faster than 690 miles an hour			1
organizers initially delayed the balloon launch tuesday morning because of gusting winds , then tried to make it happen a few hours later at the @entity0 launch site			2
however , as @entity13 waited in the capsule to be carried up to high altitude , another wind gust whipped the more than 500 - foot - tall white balloon and ruined it for the mission			1
@entity38 , the technical project director for the mission , said only one back - up balloon is now available to carry out the attempt			1
" there 's a lot riding on that , so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high , " @entity38 said			0
asked how he felt about having to call off the attempt , @entity38 replied : " deflated			2
" " for @entity13 , it 's a lot of frustration , " @entity38 added			1
" a lot of anticipation getting to this point , and then feeling that he 's going to have to wait -- it 's a lot of anxiety on his part , i 'm sure			0
" ' human helicopter ' breaks record for world 's longest flight years of preparation and untold costs to the primary sponsor , @entity65 , led to tuesday 's scheduled attempt			2
when the launch occurs , @entity13 expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon			1
then he will climb out of the capsule , jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched " delta " position to maximize his speed			2
he plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes , then deploy a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to @entity77			0
the attempt has serious risks			1
he and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous " horizontal spin			0
" at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero @entity84 or lower , and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected , his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit			1
if he loses consciousness during the five - minute plunge , he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically			1
another unknown : the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier			1
while reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft , planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on @entity13 because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted			1
" i 'm not nuts , " @entity13 said when @entity2 first interviewed him about the project in 2010			1
" you know , our records are meant to be broken , and i 'm a very competitive person			2
" on a more serious note , he added , " of course i 'm afraid of dying , because i worked so hard to reach this level			0
you know , i 'm living a good life			0
i think the most important thing i 'm doing is to come back alive			0
" @entity13 is an @entity117 helicopter pilot and former soldier who has @entity119 jumped from such landmarks as the @entity121 in @entity122 and the @entity124 statue in @entity125			1
@entity119 is an acronym for buildings , antennas , spans and @entity77 -- the four things from which you can jump			2
he has been preparing for his latest feat for five years -- both physically and mentally			0
" you have to remember all the procedures , " he said in an interview during testing for the jump			2
" you know you 're in a really hostile environment			0
and you can not think about anything else			0
you have to be focused			0
otherwise , you 're gon na die			0
" the balloon being used is light and translucent			0
the material is only .0008 of an inch thick , and it will change shape and size as it rises			0
the pressurized helmet and suit , which restrict @entity13 's mobility and together weigh 100 pounds , have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate			1
cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt			2
@entity13 was not doing interviews leading up to the jump , but his performance coach , @entity161 , described him as mentally well - prepared			1
" he knows that he 's rehearsed it and knows what to do , " @entity161 said sunday			0
" we want him in the right state of mind			0
we ask him to reflect on what he 's done , what he 's been through and what he 's achieving for himself personally , so he can relax and focus			0
" the record for such a jump is currently held by col. @entity171 , who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a @entity175 @entity174 mission			2
more than 50 years later , @entity171 is a consultant and mentor for @entity13 's effort			1
@entity171 has also been giving @entity13 advice on what to expect			1
for example , he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air : " there 's no way you can tell how fast you 're going , because there 's no visual cues			0
" @entity171 rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that @entity13 is poised to beat his record			2
" oh no. i 'm delighted , " he told @entity2 recently			0
" he 's advancing science , and he 'll do a great job			0

new : another attempt could happen this week , perhaps thursday
@entity13 hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier without a *vehicle*
risks *include* low temperatures , thin atmosphere and a possible loss of consciousness
@entity13 will have only a space suit , helmet and chute for the 120,000 - foot jump
