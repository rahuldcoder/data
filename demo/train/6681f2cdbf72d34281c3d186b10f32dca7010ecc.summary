-- november 30th marks the end of the @entity3 hurricane season , and although it was extremely active , the @entity4 is calling 2010 a " gentle giant			1
" the season wraps up with a total of 19 named storms , 12 hurricanes , and five hurricanes that were category three or higher			2
that makes 2010 the third busiest season when considering all named storms , and second busiest season on record when considering hurricanes			1
" the excellent verification of the seasonal forecast points out , once again , why one can not use this forecast as an indicator of personal risk			0
the good fortune of relatively minimal impact on the @entity27 in spite of 19 storms , 12 of which were hurricane and 5 of which were category 3 or 4 , will serve as yet another reminder that from a hurricane readiness viewpoint , one must prepare every season as if a major hurricane will impact them , " said @entity23 , director of the @entity24			1
remarkably , there were zero @entity27 hurricane landfalls in 2010			1
on average , approximately two hurricanes hit the @entity27 per year			2
less fortunate was @entity42 , which was slammed with a number of storms including @entity45 , which intensified into a major hurricane before hitting land -- the only hurricane to do so in the @entity50			2
@entity51 also had a share of the tropical activity , where storms caused deadly flooding and mudslides			0
@entity57 , director of the @entity58 , said the season 's forecast was a success			0
" as @entity4 forecasters predicted , the @entity3 hurricane season was one of the most active on record , though fortunately most storms avoided the @entity27 for that reason , you could say the season was a gentle giant			1
" the final season tally coincides well with the forecast from the @entity4 , which was issued on may 27th			0
at that time , the organization was predicting 14 to 23 named storms , eight to 14 hurricanes , and three to seven major hurricanes of category three or higher			0
a qualifier to that forecast was that it was likely the final numbers would be on the high end of the predicted ranges			0
although the @entity24 knew a busy season was coming , they were careful to say that a busy season does n't always mean extreme impacts on the @entity27 or other countries			1
" we can have quiet seasons overall that are devastating to communities , and very busy seasons like this one with hardly any @entity27 impacts , " said @entity92 , branch chief of the @entity93 at the @entity24			0
" we want folks to be prepared each and every season regardless of what kind of activity we 're expecting			0
" environmental factors lined up early for an intense season			0
@entity3 sea surface temperatures were at record warmth , which combined with favorable winds due to the presence of @entity106			2
however , the large - scale atmospheric flow over the @entity3 and position of the jet stream over the @entity27 also allowed the tropical cyclones to re-curve back to sea without impacting land			1
although the @entity116 was lucky in landfalls in 2010 , the lack of rainfall that usually accumulates during hurricane season is expected to intensify the drought situation in the region			1
tropical storms bring much - needed moisture to replenish lakes and reservoirs			0
the lack of tropical rainfall combined with ongoing @entity106 conditions could mean the @entity116 will see a drought in 2011 much like that of 2007 .			1

2010 hurricane season was second busiest on record
there were zero @entity27 hurricane landfalls
favorable wind *patterns* allowed storms to re-curve to sea
minimal tropical rainfall will contribute to *enhanced* drought in 2011
