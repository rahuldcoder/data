-- the speed at which the global economy has pivoted from the @entity3 to emerging economies like @entity5 is astounding , says author @entity6			1
" if you think back to 1978 when i was a teenager , the average @entity7 was 22 times richer than the average @entity5			1
and today it 's less than five times , " said @entity6 , a @entity9 history professor and a former adviser to 2008 @entity12 presidential candidate @entity11			1
" that 's an amazing reduction in the global imbalance and it 's happen in the space really of 30 years			2
" " the @entity3 is at a different phase of development -- economically , demographically -- and it 's also at a different place culturally from these countries that are emerging from various forms of economic control -- whether the bureaucratic system of @entity27 or the communist system that was gradually dismantled economically in @entity5 after 1978 , " he said			1
this is bringing back one of the most remarkable shifts in the global balance of economic power			2
" @entity6 sat down last week with @entity0 's @entity34 in detailed talk on the global economy			1
what are the underlying reasons for the decline of the @entity3 ? in our lifetime @entity41 ascendancy is coming to an end , after 500 years , when the story was the great divergence -- when the west got much richer than everybody else			1
and it 's extraordinary that really since the 1970s , this historical tide has turned			2
i think there are two processes at work here			2
one is the rest of the world -- led by @entity5 -- have been downloading our killer applications			1
they have been imitating the things that work well in the @entity3 , particularly in the realm of business			1
and this is to be celebrated			2
it 's great to see countries like @entity5 and @entity27 lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty by essentially copying @entity41 ways of doing things			1
but i think there is another process at work , which is in some ways independent -- the @entity3 is becoming less good at being the @entity3			1
the things that worked well in the @entity3 for over half a millennia do n't work so well now			1
and one way of looking at it is to say : why is it that the @entity41 economies have malfunctioned ? it 's not just that there ways a financial crisis and bankers are terrible people			1
it 's much more profound than that			0
why are @entity41 economies performing so badly ? one way of thinking about this is to ask why so many economies , most of them @entity41 -- @entity93 is the exception -- are currently crushed by debt , which in some cases exceed 100 % of gdp ? and these debts are forecast to rise even further in the @entity7 the simple answer is to say there is a terrible problem of government extravagancy , but i do n't think that 's the right answer			1
one way of thinking about this is to say that debt represents a tax on the future			0
and the big accumulation of debt that we 've seen over the last 20 or 30 years in the western world reflects a breach of contract between the current generation and the next generations			0
and these debts represent a big burden on the future			0
and that is one reason i think we 've seen a slowdown in the western world because these burdens of debt act as a major check on economic dynamism			0
why has this generation decided to ignore future generations ? why have we become so selfish ? at some level i think it 's a cultural shift			0
we 've moved a long way from our ideals of self - sacrifice for the future that characterized the @entity3 during its hay days of industrialization , overseas expansion -- not to mention large - scale warfare			1
so there 's partly been a cultural shift towards the ' me generation ' -- consume now , live in the present			0
but i think it 's slightly more than that			0
i think what happened after @entity147 was that it was decided in most @entity41 countries to create pretty generous welfare states that were going to exist to transfer resources from the rich to the poor			1
and that worked pretty well			2
it did reduce inequality in those countries when these systems were introduced			0
but over time the welfare state has become dysfunctional in a surprising way			1
but in a way it became a victim of its own success : it became so successful at prolonging life , that it becomes financially unsustainable , unless you make major changes to things like retirement ages			1
and everywhere you see the same basic story , whether you 're looking at northern @entity172 , southern @entity172 , or @entity173 -- welfare states become harder and harder to finance , and structural budget deficits emerge			2
that 's to say deficits that are there even when the economy is growing well			2
and i think these are symptoms of a more profound problem that is causing the @entity41 slowdown			2
contrast that with the story in @entity187 , where welfare states , let 's say in @entity5 , are much less well developed			1
is it going to take something like a fiscal cliff -- a sovereign debt crisis -- to bring this period to an end ? the @entity197 experience suggests nothing gets done until there is a crisis			0
and this crisis has begun in countries like @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , and i think soon it will spread to @entity205 , as people begin to realize that the @entity205 position is actually no better than the other @entity197 countries			0
at some point one can imagine a crisis like that happening in the most developed @entity187 economy , @entity93			0
and i think sooner or later it may end up happening in the @entity7 although i must say i 'm becoming less and less sure that will happen soon			0
there are things happening in the @entity7 that make it quite different , in the sense for example that the demographics are not so bad -- partly because of immigration -- and also interestingly the @entity7 is about to have the most amazing free lunch on the back of shale gas and shale oil			2
the @entity7 economy is going to get a really big shot in the arm			0
@entity7 set for fracking bonanza , says historian @entity6 what then is the restructuring that needs to happen at an economic level in the @entity3 ? well , i think the most important thing to recognize is that it 's not just about taxing and spending			1
if you define this too narrowly in fiscal terms then you end up in the mess that southern @entity172 is in -- trying to balance the budget , even as your economy is shrinking			0
it 's better i think to ask questions of a more profound nature about the institutional framework within which society operates			0
to me one of the most profound contrasts between the @entity3 and the rest is that things like the rule of law -- regulation , bureaucracy -- are becoming more burdensome in @entity41 countries , even as they are becoming less burdensome in emerging markets			1
you mean they are getting in the way of development ? they really are			0
i mean one of the main arguments that i make in my new book , " @entity262 , " is that the rule of law in the @entity7 is becoming the rule of lawyers			2
the legal profession has become a very major source of cost for business			0
you have very complex regulation and a very parasitic legal profession , and it battens off the private sector			0
it 's almost impossible for any major organization to function without a huge compliance department and teams of lawyers			0
and that is all just dead cost			0
it does n't really add to the productivity of the economy			2
and i think that 's one of the things that i am trying to focus on : why is our regulation so over-complicated ? why does the tax code occupy shelves , rather than just a few pages ? and why is it that if you want to regulate the financial sector , you need a bill that is 2000 - plus pages long ? if we could aspire for greater simplicity and transparency in the tax code and most regulation , i think there would be real benefits			2
as @entity5 cherry picks the @entity303 , do you think they may also fall into @entity41 excesses as well : is this an evolutionary likelihood ? it 's possible			1
they have some way to go			0
short - term , i think the biggest problem facing the @entity5 is the rule of law question			1
it 's not the democracy question			0
it 's more -- can @entity5 transition to a system in which the rule of law really works ? that matters a lot for @entity5 's rapidly growing middle class			1
they want security for their property			0
they do not want to feel that they could have their property confiscated by an all powerful party at the drop of a hat			0
it 's not difficult to see what @entity5 needs to do , but whether it can do it politically , whether it can override the vested interests , or not , i really do n't know			1
if you think about it @entity5 is acquiring this huge middle class that 's one of the direct consequences of rapid growth			1
and historically if you look at the @entity41 experience it 's the middle class that starts to push for rule of law and representative government and @entity345 -- those are middle class things to want			1
you really do n't worry about those things if you 're a peasant or an industrial worker			2
it 's inevitable i think that as this class grows in @entity5 , it will start to behave in the ways that middle classes always behave			1
and the @entity354 is not well set - up to meet those demands			0

@entity6 : ' things that worked well in the @entity3 for over half a millennia do n't work so well now "
success of welfare state has *lengthened* lifespans , but *concept* of retirement has n't changed
swelling @entity41 bureaucracies and regulations also *hamper* growth , @entity6 says
growing @entity5 middle class will help demand changes in the rule of law from @entity378
