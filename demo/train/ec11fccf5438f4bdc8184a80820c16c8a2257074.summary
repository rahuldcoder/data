@entity0 -- when a downtrodden @entity5 street vendor set himself on fire in protest after his vegetable cart was confiscated by officials , this desperate act of self - sacrifice was seen as a catalyst for a revolution that became known as the @entity13			2
contrast this with @entity15 , where almost 80 people -- men and women -- have self - immolated since 2009 in protest against @entity20 's poor treatment of @entity21 , according to rights groups			1
yet details of these cases are often sketchy and difficult to verify , such is the stranglehold @entity15 has over the region			2
as a result the issue has yet to gain real traction internationally			0
@entity20 has consistently rejected claims it is guilty of oppression in the region and insists @entity34 enjoy religious freedom and better living standards under its rule			2
yet the self - immolations continue			0
this week , a 34 - year - old father of two burned himself to death in front of a mine in the western province of @entity44 , while another 25 - year - old man set himself alight near a monastery in neighboring @entity48 province -- which borders @entity21 , known by @entity15 as the @entity49			1
both cases were confirmed by @entity15 's state - run @entity52 news agency			1
according to the @entity34 government - in - exile and @entity34 rights groups , the victims died chanting slogans calling for freedom for the @entity34 people and the return from exile of their spiritual leader , the @entity61			1
this brought the number of deaths by self - immolation to 15 in november alone -- the same month that @entity15 's political elite ushered in its next generation of leaders during the @entity70			1
in their keynote addresses , leaders , both old and new , appeared to strike a conciliatory tone			0
in his first speech as @entity77 leader last week , @entity74 stressed the need for unity in a country where the party was becoming too distant from the people			0
this followed predecessor @entity85 's comments to @entity87 delegates that the party " should consolidate and develop socialist ethnic relations of equality , unity , mutual assistance and harmony so that all ethnic groups in @entity15 will live and develop together in harmony			2
" but activists warn that if the @entity15 government continues to tighten its grip on the @entity34 people in the name of stability , it will only create more resentment			1
they point to the growing list of young victims prepared to take such extreme action , which they say reflects a desperate and painful state of mind for many			0
the @entity49 is heavily policed by @entity15 security forces , with @entity110 content controlled by local authorities and access by foreign media largely prohibited , making reliable information almost impossible to come by			0
pro-tibetan groups such as the @entity116 , say thousands of people have died over the years under @entity15 's tenure , through torture , execution , suicides and starvation -- though @entity1 can not verify these claims			1
the groups also claim @entity34 have gradually become the minority population in their own homeland , as @entity126 -- @entity15 's main ethnic group -- have migrated to the region			1
@entity130 - based @entity129 says the construction of a rail link to @entity21 's capital , @entity134 , in 2006 -- part of @entity15 's @entity136 ( @entity137 ) -- was intended to cement its control over the restive western regions of @entity15 , particularly @entity21 and @entity140 , where separatism remains strong			1
" the incidents are a clear indication of the genuine grievances of the @entity34 and their sense of deep resentment and despair over the prevailing conditions in @entity21 , " @entity34 leader in exile , @entity142 , said earlier this year			2
his government - in - exile has repeatedly called on the international community to intervene to prevent further bloodshed			0
@entity15 authorities insist that self - immolations are isolated incidents and most @entity34 do not sympathize with or support such actions			1
a senior official from @entity159 , a province with a large @entity34 population that has seen the most self - immolation cases so far , says he knows exactly who 's to blame -- the @entity61 : the man @entity20 calls a " terrorist			2
" " they plot , incite and instigate -- the root cause for such acts is the @entity61 clique , " @entity164 told @entity1			0
" his loyalists have called those who committed self - immolation national heroes or freedom fighters , vowing to build them monuments and rewarding their families with lots of money			0
" the @entity61 has long denied @entity15 's assertion that he 's seeking @entity34 independence , saying he wants only an autonomy that would offer protection for their traditional @entity183 culture			1
during an address to @entity186 lawmakers in @entity187 earlier this month , he blamed " narrow - minded @entity77 officials " for seeing @entity183 culture as a threat			0
he then called on @entity15 authorities to investigate and address the causes of the recent surge in self - immolations			2
" i always ask the @entity15 government : please , now , thoroughly investigate			0
what is the cause of these sort of sad things ? " @entity20 's claim over the region is rooted in history			0
it says @entity21 has been a part of @entity15 since the 13th century , when the @entity203 , which conquered @entity15 and formed the @entity204 , also conquered @entity21			0
western and central parts of @entity21 are administered by @entity15 as the @entity49 , while eastern parts of the region fall under @entity15 's @entity159 , @entity48 , @entity208 and @entity44 provinces			1
after several decades of de facto independence beginning in 1912 , @entity21 was over-run by @entity15 's @entity211 in 1950 to enforce the newly - formed @entity15 's claim of sovereignty over @entity21			1
in 1959 , thousands of @entity34 surrounded the @entity61 's palace in @entity134 â € ” the @entity34 capital -- to protect him against what was rumored to be a plot by the @entity15 military to abduct him			2
the gathering turned into an all - out revolt against @entity15 rule , which was suppressed by the @entity211			1
the @entity61 fled to @entity222 , where he has remained in exile ever since			0
@entity1 's @entity224 contributed to this report .			0

@entity15 says its rule has brought *economic* stability to the @entity34 people
