-- this is what happens when politics starts looking like a cult : @entity5 gets attacked for being a traitor to the conservative cause			1
the former @entity9 governor has been speaking with the freedom of someone not running for office , saying that both his father and @entity14 would have had a hard time in today 's hard - right @entity16 and questioning the wisdom of @entity19 's absolutist anti-tax pledge			1
that set off a fascinating public fight between @entity5 and @entity19 , two faces of competing factions within @entity16			1
it is the latest evidence of a growing @entity16 backlash against the ideological straitjacket @entity19 has attempted to impose on governing in the @entity27			1
on one side is a vision of the @entity16 that is committed to reaching out beyond its base with a focus on governing responsibly in the national interest			2
on the other side is a @entity16 driven by ideological activists and special interests , elevating pledges over principled but pragmatic solutions			2
the @entity19 pledge commits signers to oppose all tax increases on individuals or businesses in any circumstances as well as changing deductions or credits unless they are revenue neutral			1
this skirmish started when @entity5 was asked about the pledge : " i ran for office three times , " he explained			1
" the pledge was presented to me three times			2
i never signed the pledge			2
i cut taxes every year i was governor			0
i do n't believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people			0
" the common - sense statement was regarded as a shot across the bow to @entity19 , who quickly went on @entity0 's " @entity61 " to push back , saying that @entity5 had " stepped in it " and " really misspoke and insulted @entity63 " because @entity63 had fallen in line and obediently signed the pledge			1
escalation occurred this week when @entity5 said , " @entity14 would have , based on his record of finding accommodation , finding some degree of common ground , as would my dad -- they would have a hard time if you define the @entity16 -- and i do n't -- as having an orthodoxy that does n't allow for disagreement , does n't allow for finding some common ground			1
" he added , " back to my dad 's time and @entity14 's time -- they got a lot of stuff done with a lot of bipartisan support , " saying that @entity14 " would be criticized for doing the things that he did			1
" this statement has the advantage of being both opinion and fact			0
@entity14 achieved his administration 's agenda through cooperation with liberal democrat @entity95 , the @entity96 speaker			1
there were deep philosophical differences between the two but also a capacity to work together			0
both @entity14 and @entity5 -- and for that matter even @entity101 -- would be accused of violating a number of litmus tests currently considered deal - breakers by conservatives			1
but let 's look closer at one in particular : taxes			0
of course , @entity14 championed lower tax rates , but he also signed off on a number of smaller tax hikes to help address revenue shortfalls and most importantly backed a bipartisan 1986 bill that closed loopholes as part of a simplification plan that raised revenues to help deal with the deficit			1
this inconvenient fact is often denied by @entity19 and other activists because it is their prime objection to attempts to find a " grand bargain " on deficits and debt , along the lines of the recommendations of the @entity129			2
in pursuit of a reality check , take a look at this quote : " we 're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share			0
in theory , some of those loopholes were understandable , but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing , while a bus driver was paying 10 % of his salary , and that 's crazy			0
it 's time we stopped it			0
" that might sound straight out of president @entity151 " @entity156 " playbook -- which conservatives routinely attack as " class warfare " -- but in fact it is the sainted @entity14 speaking in 1985			2
add to that the fact that the first president @entity5 backed a bipartisan deficit reduction plan that included a 2 - to - 1 spending cut to tax revenue formula and you have the kind of data that drives @entity19 nuts			1
here was his response to @entity5 on this front : " there 's a guy who watched his father throw away his presidency on a 2:1 ( ratio of spending cuts to tax increases ) promise			1
... and he thinks he 's sophisticated by saying that he 'd take a 10:1 promise			0
he does n't understand -- he 's just agreed to walk down the same alley his dad did with the same gang			0
and he thinks he 's smart			2
you walk down that alley , you do n't come out			0
" the angry defensiveness of the statement , the thinly veiled threats and thuggish imagery , has all the signs of someone who worries that he might be losing a rational argument			0
as it turns out , @entity19 has reason to be concerned			2
it 's not just @entity5			1
a growing number of republicans are rejecting his pledge			0
@entity196 conservative sen. @entity195 called the pledge 's effective veto of deficit reduction plans " ridiculous " when talking with @entity200 on " @entity201			1
" sen. @entity202 of @entity203 on tuesday declared his independence from the pledge , saying , " we 're so far in debt , that if you do n't give up some ideological ground , the country sinks			0
" add to those voices seven other @entity16 @entity27 senators -- from @entity214 's @entity213 to @entity216 's @entity215 to @entity218 's @entity217 -- and 11 @entity16 @entity96 members , ranging from centrist @entity221 @entity220 to tea party @entity222			1
the bottom line is that a growing number of republicans are deciding to throw off the ideological straitjacket to get serious about actually reducing the deficit and the debt			0
it is a courageous move at a time when cultlike group - think dictates that the pledge must be signed or your political career is dead in the water			0
the choice between @entity5 's and @entity19 's vision of the @entity16 is ultimately no contest at all			1
it 's the difference between responsible governance and agitated activism , a growing party or a shrinking one			0
and of course in the end the only pledge that really matters is the @entity248			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

it 's a *bad* sign for @entity16 when @entity5 's conservative *allegiance* questioned , @entity251 says
@entity251 says @entity5 was right to *repudiate* @entity19 's anti-tax pledge
@entity14 was willing to accept some tax increases to achieve *compromise* , he says
@entity251 : in the battle between @entity5 and @entity19 , the smart choice is to back @entity5 's view
