@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is always guaranteed the best seat in his local synagogue here , but the privilege comes with a downside : he 's the last @entity9 in @entity1			1
the country 's 800 - year - old @entity9 community -- an estimated 40,000 strong at its peak -- is now a party of one			2
but @entity3 , for his part , is n't going anywhere soon			2
for more than a decade , he has refused to join his wife and two teenage daughters in @entity19			1
" my family call me all the time and say , ' come here , you 're the last @entity9 in @entity1 , what are you doing there ? ' " he says			2
@entity3 , a former carpet dealer , refuses to answer that question			0
" i do n't know why i 'm still living here , " he says			0
" he has n't seen his daughters -- now ages 14 and 16 -- since his one trip to @entity19 12 years ago			2
but the bald and bespectacled @entity3 says he is content guarding a cupboard full of dusty prayer books -- one is 400 years old , he says -- spending holidays with visitors from @entity37 and the @entity38 and surviving off donations from @entity9 around the world			1
historical evidence suggests a sizable @entity9 community in @entity1 since the @entity43 , according to the @entity44 , a nonprofit group			2
@entity1 's @entity9 population reached 40,000 in the mid- 19th century , the group says , and began declining around 1870 with the passage of anti-jewish measures			1
@entity19 's creation in 1948 drew most of @entity1 's remaining @entity9			1
@entity3 's synagogue -- the last in @entity1 's capital -- sits inconspicuously in a courtyard behind busy city streets , though a close inspection reveals @entity55 in second - story metal railings			1
the interior is adorned only by broken light fixtures and ceiling fans			0
but @entity3 says he is hardly in hiding			0
" they 're all like my brothers here , " he said of his fellow @entity1			0
" it does n't make a difference whether i 'm here or in @entity19			0
" that was n't the case under @entity69 rule , which ended with the @entity38 invasion of @entity1 in 2001 , though @entity69 forces have been resurgent in parts of the country			1
@entity3 says he was arrested four times under @entity69 rule and that he was beaten while in custody			1
" the @entity69 was a problem , " he says			0
" they interfered in everyone 's business , but now they 're gone , they 're finished			0
" which means that @entity3 is more inclined than ever to stay put .			0
