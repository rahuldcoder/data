the @entity6 noted that the biggest tremor struck at 9:51 a.m. local time ( 1:51 p.m. et ) , centered some 80 miles northwest of @entity9			1
its large magnitude was balanced out , somewhat , by how far down it occurred -- 64 miles deep , according to the @entity6			1
" normally , we do n't have large magnitude quakes this deep , " said @entity13 seismologist @entity12 , noting that the tremor was felt strongly in @entity14 and as far south as @entity15			1
" because it was that deep , it did n't cause as much damage as a shallower quake			2
" still , it was big enough to create messes and cause scares in the state dubbed @entity26			0
