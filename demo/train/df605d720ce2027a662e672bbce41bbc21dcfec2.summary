since @entity2 fighters entered @entity3 from @entity4 , they have given the world a revolting look at their ruthlessness			1
they have left the severed heads of their vanquished on spikes			0
they have filled mass graves with the summarily executed			0
they have slaughtered and enslaved ethnic minority @entity13			0
when the @entity2 drove tens of thousands of them up mountains , where many died of thirst , it seemed the last straw			2
@entity20 president @entity19 ordered airstrikes to beat them back			2
but the same cruelty has fumed next door in @entity4 -- along with the atrocities committed by forces loyal to president @entity26 against rebel fighters			1
while the world focused on the plight of the @entity13 in @entity3 , 500 @entity4 civilians died practically unnoticed			1
so , why is the @entity20 intervening in @entity3 , while avoiding @entity4 ? the answers lie in some clear differences in the two conflicts : 1			1
international opposition no nation protects @entity2			2
even @entity36 is disgusted by its viciousness			0
but international political entanglement awaits any power pondering action in @entity4 , due to loyalties to @entity26			2
as the @entity20 and its allies have called for action against his regime , @entity41 and @entity42 have put their foot down in the @entity49			2
and @entity42 has kept @entity26 well - armed			0
although @entity42 rails against @entity51 extremists , a @entity20 intervention -- even only against @entity2 -- would meet with deep distrust in the @entity54 , especially after the relationship with @entity56 hit the dustbin over @entity58			1
@entity59 , a close @entity26 ally , would likely also be up in arms			0
@entity62 is allegedly supplying @entity64 militia @entity63 , which has crossed from @entity65 to shore up @entity26 's troops			0
confusing battlefield @entity4 's war is a checkerboard battle -- government troops and @entity63 in a fight against @entity2 and other resistance groups , who also battle each other			1
@entity19 does n't see a strong partner in the politically fractured @entity76 , because it 's hardly a formidable force against @entity26 's professional army			0
in @entity3 , the battle lines are clearer -- the @entity3 government with @entity20 support vs. @entity2			1
@entity83 has made a shaky showing against the militants			0
but in the north , @entity56 has a strong , loyal partner in semi-autonomous @entity88			0
many of the @entity20 advisers deployed to @entity3 are stationed in its capital @entity93 to support @entity95 troops in hot confrontation with @entity51 state			1
ineffective airstrikes the @entity4 government has professional air defenses , including its own air force , which would give the @entity20 military serious resistance			1
though @entity2 has struck some aircraft , its air defenses are flimsy when compared to @entity26 's			0
the @entity3 government was bombing @entity2 long before @entity20 drones and warplanes joined them , and the @entity88 government has begged for @entity20 air support			1
president @entity19 has approved targeted strikes in @entity3 , but his hawkish critics in @entity56 have called for much tougher @entity20 military action against the @entity116 extremists			1
it 's a moan often heard in the @entity20 these days			0
@entity3 would not be in this predicament , had @entity20 forces not invaded and destabilized it			1
morally , the country owes them			0
add to that the @entity20 and civilian lives lost in the war to depose former dictator @entity127 , the hundreds of billions spent , the training and arming of @entity3 forces			1
the @entity20 has no such vested interest in @entity4			1
but , says @entity133 analyst @entity132 , that 's a stance @entity56 ca n't afford to maintain			0
" the @entity20 should develop a more cogent and integrated policy approach that deals with @entity4 and @entity3 together -- the challenges in both countries are becoming more interlinked , " he said			1
a wariness to step in to be sure , the president 's stance has its critics			0
@entity143 senators @entity141 and @entity144 want @entity19 to take the fight against @entity2 into @entity4			1
respect for its borders take a back seat to stopping the extremists , they say			0
former @entity20 ambassador to @entity4 @entity151 resigned in protest of @entity20 's inaction against @entity26			1
he has found fault with @entity56 for allowing @entity2 to burgeon in @entity4			2
and former secretary of state @entity155 recently said that the president does not apply @entity20 might aggressively enough			0
but , after pulling the country out of two wars in @entity160 and @entity3 , the president has said that the @entity20 should be leery of trying to solve the world 's crisis			2
as he has reportedly said , " do n't do stupid stuff			0
" how religion could complicate @entity20 intervention in @entity3 opinion : what the @entity20 can realistically do in @entity3			2

@entity2 cruelty has fumed in @entity4 , too , along with government atrocities
but complex entanglements would make it more difficult to act there than in @entity3
in @entity4 , the government would fight against the @entity20 ; in @entity3 they are partners
