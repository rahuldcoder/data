-- @entity1 has a problem			1
it 's not engagement or the lack of a clear way to monetize itself			0
it 's not those sometimes - unwieldy friend - organizing circles , or even the perception that no one other than nerds uses the service			2
the problem , its creators believe , is that many people keep comparing it to @entity17 -- or , more broadly , social networks			1
while social interaction is a key part of @entity1 , the project is much more ambitious			1
@entity1 is nothing short of a wholesale upgrade to all of @entity24 's products and services , but with the identity of the user incorporated			1
@entity28 sat down with @entity29 , @entity24 's senior vice president of social business , and @entity31 , @entity1 's vice president of product , at the @entity33 developer conference			1
they were excited about the new @entity1 features that were announced -- the events feature and the new tablet app -- but they were also quick to downplay any comparisons to @entity17 , or any suggestion that many people are n't interested in joining @entity1			1
" @entity1 is just an upgrade to @entity24 , " says @entity29			1
" people have a hard time understanding that			0
i think they like to compare us with other social competitors , and they see us through that lens instead of really seeing what 's happening : @entity24 is taking its amazing products , and by bringing them together , they just become more awesome			1
" @entity29 and others have said this before , and you get the sense that they really believe in their recipe for @entity58			2
@entity24 also released some new statistics to parry any stabs at accusing the network of not having a large and engaged audience -- 250 million total users , with 150 million of them visiting every month , and half of those people signing in every day ( if you 're doing the math , that 's 75 million daily active @entity69 )			1
wading into @entity1 's @entity70 but with the definition of @entity1 so broad , what constitutes " active daily use " becomes a little hazy			2
if i 'm signed into @entity1 and simply do a @entity24 search or upload a photo to @entity77 , does that count ? as @entity24 defines the service , it would appear so			1
however , a user performing such basic @entity24 tasks may never visit the @entity82 , @entity1 's main social feature			1
that brings the question : just how engaged are @entity24 's users with the @entity70 ? this week at @entity33 , @entity29 revealed that " active " users of @entity1 spend an average of 12 minutes in the stream , up from 9 minutes three months ago			1
still , that 's not quite on par with @entity17 , which sees its users spend a grand total of 10.5 billion total minutes spent on the network every day , according to its ipo filing			2
while that becomes about the same 12 minutes if you divide by @entity17 's 900 million users , remember that we 're talking about active users here , so @entity17 's actual engagement is actually much higher			2
so since this area is actually where the comparison to @entity17 is valid , how can @entity24 both increase the proportion of active users as well as boost engagement on the @entity70 ? " that 's a fair question , " says @entity29			1
" i think there we boost engagement by giving people ways to connect things that they care about and are exciting — that nobody else has			0
" @entity31 believes as more users " upgrade " to @entity1 — which essentially just means letting @entity24 know who you are — it 'll become clear to them that @entity24 's many services become much more useful			1
and at some point they 'll find the @entity70			0
" when @entity24 knows that i 'm a man , and i live in this zip code , and i went to this school , and i have these interests , my entire experience gets better , " he explains			2
" you will discover our engagement is massive , and guess what ? your friends , family and loved ones are already here			0
it 's not as if we need to acquire users			0
we just need to bring them into the light			0
" @entity138 the way @entity31 and @entity140 describe it , upgrading to @entity1 is almost a religious conversion : you were n't really living ( i.e. using @entity24 ) until you make the transition			1
still , @entity24 is a business , and it does n't undertake massive projects like @entity1 without some kind of plan to monetize them			1
so far , @entity1 does n't have anything like @entity152 's trending topics ( although it has a " what 's hot " stream that 's a click or tap away for users ) or @entity17 's sponsored stories			1
when asked if we might someday see similar features introduced in @entity1 , @entity29 would n't say , but his change in manner betrays a disdain for how @entity24 's competitors incorporate advertising			1
" our business model is very different , " he says			0
some of our competitors are like going to a baseball stadium			0
if you have 90,000 people there , you 're going to put up ads everywhere , and that 's basically the core business model			0
you 're looking at a picture of your daughter , we 're going to show you an ad			0
" we have a very different philosophy			0
we think the right time to show and ad is when you are at the moment of commercial intent			0
when @entity183 doing a house remodel , and i 'm looking for a microwave oven , then i see @entity31 's +1 on a @entity188 appliance , that means a lot more to me			0
" @entity29 repeated a statistic that @entity24 has released before — that when brands use @entity1 's social extensions in their ads , the click - through rate ( @entity192 ) jumps by 5 - 10 %			1
while some have questioned that statistic , the fundamental idea of incorporating recommendations from friends into the ads they 're seeing online makes a great deal of sense , and it 's the business model of more than one company			0
still , @entity29 wo n't rule out the possibility of sponsored stories down the road			2
" we do n't serve ads [ on @entity1 ] , but that does n't mean we wo n't have sponsored stories , " he says			2
" there may be more relevant forms of advertising that we do believe work			0
" the business of hangouts there may be other sources of revenue for @entity1 , though			2
one of the much - touted advantages @entity1 has over competitors ( perceived or otherwise ) is hangouts — video chats you can have with multiple people , even through a mobile device and are absolutely free			1
hangouts have been a major differentiator for @entity1 since the beginning , but until recently @entity24 had positioned them as a casual , consumer - friendly feature , not a business tool ( a new ad for @entity229 shows a work group having a meeting )			1
since their introduction , many businesses ( including @entity28 ) have adopted hangouts for collaboration , and it begs the question : why has n't @entity24 been more proactive about courting business users ? " we hear this so much , " says @entity31			1
" so many startups are running their business on hangouts			0
even big companies who would be embarrassed if i told you which ones			0
their expansive camera units take longer to boot up than it takes to launch a hangout with commodity hardware and webcams in your laptop			0
" " there are lots of examples of great consumer tech coming into the enterprise , " @entity29 adds , " because it 's just so awesome			2
you could go back to 1991 with @entity268			0
enterprises really did n't want it , but it was just so great			0
if we can solve a problem for every human on earth , then businesses of course will use it			0
" so when will @entity24 announce @entity229 ? " we 're very well aware of the opportunity in enterprise			2
we 're not ignoring it			0
you should expect announcements from us in the future that add unique features that enterprises would need			0
" @entity1 's @entity284 to some , @entity1 made too many stumbles along the way to become a real @entity17 competitor			1
as @entity29 and @entity31 see it , that 's the wrong way of looking at it			2
@entity1 is simply @entity24 's way of taking its many disparate services — search , @entity290 , maps , etc. — and making them more relevant by incorporating the user 's personal data			1
if some of those services then end up rubbing up against what @entity17 offers , so be it			0
in the bigger picture of platforms , though , the comparison is more than appropriate			0
both @entity17 and @entity24 want you to spend your time on their site , not the other 's			1
@entity17 began with social interaction and spread to broader services such as messaging			2
@entity24 's taking it the other way around — creating a suite of extremely popular products and then persuading users to get social with them			1
which approach is better ? i do n't think there 's much question that @entity24 's services improve greatly when you add in personal data , be it location , gender , interest or other factors			1
but the social component is incredibly powerful , and in that aspect @entity17 is king ( @entity17 's engagement numbers are massive compared to @entity1 — the stream , anyway )			1
for the longest time , people have been trained to socialize there			0
it 's difficult to imagine a world , even in the long term , where that activity shifts to @entity24			2
but maybe it does n't need to			0
can @entity1 still be considered a success even if the @entity70 never quite becomes as influential as @entity17 's news feed ? @entity24 probably would like to think so , but it 's clear that , for now at least , many perceive @entity1 as a poor man 's @entity17			1
and if perceptions are great enough , it has a way of become reality			0
yep , @entity1 has a problem			0

@entity1 creator says the site should n't be compared to @entity17 and @entity152
@entity29 says @entity24 's social tool is meant to *enhance* other @entity24 offerings
video - chat hangouts have been a *highlight* for @entity1
