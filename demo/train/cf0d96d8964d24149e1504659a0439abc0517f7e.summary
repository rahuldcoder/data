-- @entity1 , that icon of left - leaning @entity3 whose board of directors includes former @entity6 vice president @entity5 , is really a symbol of the @entity8			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , meanwhile , are more like @entity11			1
got that ? this analysis comes courtesy of @entity15 , the conservative talk - show host , who ventured into the unfamiliar world of tech punditry last week			2
on his radio show friday , @entity15 went on a curious rant about how tech bloggers are overrun with liberals who hate @entity1 -- not unlike , in his view , how the mainstream ( translation : left - wing ) media covers the @entity8			1
" i would venture to say that 9 out of 10 bloggers writing high - tech hate @entity1			1
@entity1 is the equivalent of the @entity8 on these blogs , and @entity9 , @entity34 , and @entity10 are the equivalent of the @entity11			1
they 're perfect , they ca n't do anything wrong , they 're ideal , and everybody hates @entity1 , " he said , according to a transcript posted on his website			0
@entity15 added this opinion of tech bloggers : " i 'd say most of them vote @entity48			2
most of them think they 're young and hip , pop culture hip			0
that 's high - tech , of course it would be			1
republicans to them are probably aliens from @entity59 , racists , sexists , bigot homophobes			0
" the right - wing commentator went on to accuse @entity66 , @entity65 bloggers of " faking data , faking news to make it look bad for @entity1 when it really is n't			2
" he added that a small minority of @entity72 bloggers are starting to write about this " media bias , " even though " they do n't understand it			0
" @entity15 offered no explanation for why so - called liberal bloggers would favor @entity9 and @entity10 over @entity1			1
his comments prompted some head - scratching among tech reporters who questioned @entity15 's knowledge of the tech - media landscape			1
" yes , there are certain bloggers who obviously favor one company or another , " wrote @entity83 for @entity84			0
" but the idea that 9 out of 10 bloggers regularly toss rancid red tomatoes at @entity1 , while @entity92 is trapped in the stocks and pleading for his life , seems a trifle stretched			1
" others took issue with @entity15 comparing @entity1 to the @entity8			1
while @entity1 has evolved from a scrappy , counterculture startup into a wealthy corporation that 's a darling of @entity102 , it 's been more historically aligned with left - leaning causes			2
its late co-founder , @entity104 , often expressed support for @entity6 candidates			0
and still others poked fun at @entity15 's comment , in describing the tech sites he reads , that " some of these blogs have actual websites			1
" " i dunno about anyone else , but when i want a real nuanced take on the tech industry , i go to @entity15 , " said @entity113 on @entity114			0
" @entity15 says that @entity1 is like the @entity8			2
that grinding sound you hear is coming from @entity104 ' grave , " added @entity114 user @entity118			0
when asked by a listener to identify which tech sites and bloggers he was talking about , @entity15 declined			2
" folks , i 've thought about it , and there 's nothing to be gained by it			0
if i call ' em out , all they 're gon na do is get happy that i 'm giving them attention ... it 's not gon na change them , " he said			0
" they do n't need more readers			0
the more readers they have , the more damage they would do			0
