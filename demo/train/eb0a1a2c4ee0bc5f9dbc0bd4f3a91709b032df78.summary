-- @entity2 boxer @entity1 wants a third clash with @entity4 following saturday night 's successful defense of his @entity7 and @entity8 lightweight titles			1
the 37 - year - old stopped @entity11 's @entity10 on a technical knockout in the ninth round in @entity14 to take his record to 52 - 5 with 38 @entity16			1
the only draw of his career came against @entity4 in 2004 when he retained his @entity7 and @entity20 featherweight titles , but he lost his @entity22 super featherweight belt in a controversial split decision to the @entity24 in 2008			1
" we know that @entity4 has been avoiding us			0
we will put a lot of work into it , and a third fight is what the public wants to see , " @entity1 told reporters after beating @entity10 , whose brother @entity27 -- a horse - racing jockey -- died last month			1
" yes he beat bigger fellows but they are all past their prime , while i beat younger and stronger boxers like @entity38 and @entity10			0
" however , one stumbling block to a rematch is that @entity1 wants it at the weight limit of 140 - 142 pounds , while @entity4 's trainer @entity43 says he wants to fight at 147			1
" i know he can make that weight as when he fought @entity45 [ this month ] , he was just 144 pounds			0
so if they insist in fighting at 147 , like @entity43 has mentioned , they are again giving excuses			0
" however , @entity4 doubts that the public wants to see him fight @entity1 again , @entity50 reported on sunday			1
" will they still watch it ? " @entity4 said in @entity54			0
the newspaper said @entity4 's business manager @entity56 would accept the fight if @entity1 promoted it			2
" @entity4 thinks @entity1 has a small fan base , that 's why he does n't want any hand in the promotion			2
all he wants is a guaranteed purse , and that @entity63 and mp promotions wo n't be involved in the promotions			0
then he will take the fight , " @entity56 said			0
following his win over @entity45 two weeks ago , @entity4 has been linked with a bout against @entity69 veteran @entity68 , who he has yet to encounter			2
@entity4 has this year juggled his political career with two successful fights , beating @entity72 before stopping @entity45 to become the first man to win world titles in eight weight categories .			2

@entity1 *targets* another crack at @entity24 fighter @entity4
the @entity2 lost to @entity4 on points two years ago after a tie in 2004
he retained his @entity7 and @entity8 lightweight titles against @entity10 on saturday
the defeated @entity11 fought just a month after the death of his brother
