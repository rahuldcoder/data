-- the video showing @entity4 punching @entity2 inside an elevator was released monday			1
and everyone should watch it			2
in fact , you should show it to your daughters and your sons , as hard as it is to witness			0
we already knew that @entity4 punched his wife and she was knocked unconscious , but when you witness the violence you can no longer turn this " incident " into a tiff between drunk lovers or blame the victim : @entity2			1
many people had done just that , and speculated on whether she had provoked @entity4			1
the @entity24 blamed her when they suggested in a tweet that she had played a role in the incident			2
the tweet , which was taken down on monday , read : " @entity30 says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident			0
" what role was that exactly ? her role as punching bag ? her role lying unconscious ? her role , as this @entity40 anchor said after seeing her punched , " in not taking the stairs			0
" domestic violence usually takes place behind closed doors ; that 's because batterers typically hide the abuse			1
no surprise that @entity4 did n't assault her in the lobby but waited until they were alone in the elevator before he punched his wife			1
victims are afraid of their batterers , and now that you 've seen the video , you understand why			0
i 'm sure @entity2 was terrified of getting him in trouble with the police or the @entity63 , but thankfully @entity4 was wrong : they were n't alone , the world was watching			1
we were watching as he knocked her cold onto the floor with one punch to her face , causing her to smash into the railing of the elevator and fall lifeless on the ground			0
we were watching as he dragged her limp body partway out of elevator and dumped her with her skirt up and bum showing to the audience in the lobby			0
we watch as he appeared to kicked her with his shoes on , perhaps to see if she would wake up			0
and as she regains consciousness , we watch her sit up then flop back down , head between the elevator doors as they are about to close			2
it is a stranger who kneels down and cradles her			0
not only is the punch shocking , but @entity4 's complete lack of care , remorse or concern for her as she 's lying unconscious is what sticks out			2
he 's a batterer and she 's a victim of abuse			2
opinion : @entity63 , apologize to women for @entity4 i 'm sure he apologized later to her and felt sorry			1
that 's part of the cycle of abuse : violence then a honeymoon period , only to be followed by violence again			2
@entity117 , president of the @entity118 and the @entity119 , has said an abused woman will leave a relationship approximately seven times before she leaves for good because of the psychological damage that batterers inflict			0
there are countless reasons victims recant their stories or stay in an abusive relationship : low self - worth , financial worries , fear , even love			0
instead of wondering why a victim stays , the world would do better to focus on punishing the batterer			0
the @entity63 , faced with new evidence that proves @entity2 had no role in this incident , regardless of what she might have said to downplay it , are doing what they should have done after the first video showed her unconscious on a lobby floor and @entity4 admitted he had assaulted her			1
the @entity24 just released @entity4 and @entity63 commissioner @entity145 suspended him indefinitely			1
it 's sad that it takes a @entity149 daily newspaper to remove a child molester from the locker rooms of @entity152 and @entity153 to remove an admitted batterer from their ranks			0
the @entity63 completely screwed this up from the beginning by interviewing @entity30 with her batterer present and not using common sense and seeking the full video to begin with			1
the victim blaming has to end and the world must learn a lesson for the sake of all victims of domestic abuse			1
@entity63 officials knew what he did , but it was only when they had to watch it that they did the right thing			1
@entity2 , wherever you are , and despite what some will say , you need to know you have done nothing wrong			0
and when @entity4 made the choice to punch you , he made a choice that will forever determine his fate .			2

@entity181 : everyone should watch the video of @entity4 punching his then - *fiance*
seeing it , you ca n't say , as some have ( including the @entity24 ) that she was *culpable*
she says domestic violence happens behind closed doors ; there @entity4 abuse terrible
@entity195 : @entity63 dumped @entity4 . victim blaming has to stop . *janay* , you were the victim here
