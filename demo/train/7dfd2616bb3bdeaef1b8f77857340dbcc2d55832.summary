now that the trailer for the seventh " @entity2 " movie is out , you can imagine the anticipation among the millions of fans of the film franchise			1
and why not ? the six " @entity2 " films have been enormous successes : they have grossed over $ 2 billion domestically at the box office , spawned scores of books , comic books and merchandise ( how many kids have their own light saber ? ) and made household names of characters like @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
they 've also been the worst thing ever for the science fiction genre			1
i say this as someone who has been a devoted sci - fi reader since childhood			1
i was so blown away by the first " @entity2 " film when i saw it in 1977 , i went back two more times the same week to wallow in its space age fantasy			2
but here 's the thing : @entity37 ' creation , basically a blown - up @entity39 adventure with better special effects , has left all too many people thinking science fiction is some computer graphics - laden space opera / western filled with shootouts , territorial disputes , evil patriarchs and trusty mounts ( like the @entity48 )			1
" @entity2 " has corrupted people 's notion of a literary genre full of ideas , turning it into a saturday afternoon serial			1
and that 's more than a shame -- it 's an obscenity			0
science fiction is in fact one of the most creative literary genres around			0
the best of sci - fi is filled with meditations on what 's " out there , " what makes us human , how technology is used and how it is changing us			1
it takes up issues of race , sexuality and quite literally everything else under the sun. it is essentially about ideas , not action , and that 's the problem , as far as @entity79 is concerned			1
there are , for example , no light sabers , spaceships or @entity84 in the 1979 novel " @entity86 , " by @entity87 , who won the @entity88 and @entity89 , sci - fi 's top awards , and was also awarded a @entity92			1
@entity94 's main themes are race and sex , and in " @entity86 " she wrote about a modern black woman who travels back in time to the @entity99 , where she is enslaved			2
the novel is regularly taught in classrooms and has made at least one list of " @entity103			0
" but @entity79 has yet to adapt it for the screen			2
maybe if the lead character had a wookiee by her side ... many of the great works of sci - fi have not been made into films -- the @entity114 novels of @entity115 , @entity117 's " @entity116 , " @entity119 's " @entity118 , " among others -- partially because they are too smart , too dense and too thoughtful			1
sure , some classics have made the transition , but the track record is spotty : @entity130 's " dune " was a disaster , for example , and the recent " @entity128 " was a mixed bag that was not successful at the box office			2
@entity132 's " @entity131 , " although stylish and intellectual , was a bit too frigid for a mass audience			0
which means that @entity79 studios , not known for thinking outside the box , opt for the " @entity2 " template -- lots of whiz bang , plenty of quirky alien characters , cgi to the max , plenty of explosions and little thought of any kind			2
to be sure , the first " @entity2 " was a breath of fresh air , a fun flick for sci - fi geeks			1
but the series quickly ossified , a victim of its own success			0
only two of the films -- " @entity2 " and " @entity158 " -- show any originality			0
the rest tread water , give the hardcore fans the same old , same old			0
i mean , how many light sabre duels can you sit through before you 're bored out of your skull ? how many outer space dogfights ? how many seemingly profound @entity168 thoughts ? me , i 'm giving up on the whole thing			0
i do n't care that @entity170 , a director with talent , is helming the new flick			0
he 's hemmed in by audience expectations -- like casting the stars of the original in this film -- and recycling stale material			0
instead , i 'll queue up " @entity179 , " and enjoy the most original sci - fi movie of the past 25 years			1
i recommend " @entity2 " fans do the same			0
they need to be reminded what real creativity is all about .			0

@entity183 : people *thrilled* about seventh " @entity2 movie " do n't get it 's *bad* sci - fi
he loved first *installments* , but franchise *evolved* into worst thing ever for rich literary genre
@entity79 only wants @entity196 - ready sc - fi plots , skips complex greats like @entity94 , @entity115
@entity183 : few real sci - fi movies made . new " @entity2 " promises to be empty of ideas .
