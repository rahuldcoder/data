-- as captain of the @entity4 tugboat , @entity1 spends his days gently directing giant cargo vessels in and around the vast port of @entity7 , @entity8			1
it 's a job that requires patience , concentration and flawless planning			0
but life on the water was n't always so rigidly structured -- far from it			0
behind the sailor 's steely visage lie memories of distant shores , daring adventures and a terrifying ordeal at the hands of pirates			2
a boat in the distance @entity1 hesitates when recalling the moment he realized armed bandits were fast approaching his ship off the coast of @entity29			1
as the first mate of the @entity31 , @entity1 was in charge of 21 crewmen and cargo aboard the @entity35 operated freight vessel transporting aging @entity38 military equipment to the port of @entity40 , @entity41 , via the @entity42			1

on the september 25 , 2008 , however , the ship 's second officer approached @entity1 to inform him he had spotted two small dots in the distance moving towards the @entity31 at speed			1
despite sailing more than five times the recommended distance from the coast as a precaution against hijacking , the fast moving dots were speedboats carrying heavily armed pirates			1
the assailants boarded the @entity31 and searched below the ship 's decks , quickly realizing they had chanced upon valuable cargo			1
" when they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised , " @entity1 said			1
" they put the prize for liberation to $ 50 million dollars			0
the usual prize for liberation was approximately not more than $ 1 million			0
" hostage at sea the discovery of the military cargo signaled the beginning of a four month standoff between the pirates and a host of parties with an interest in reclaiming the ship , including @entity84 , the @entity85 and the @entity41 government			2

bargaining chips in the middle of all this were @entity1 and his crew			2
at the time of the attack , the ship 's captain , @entity98 , had taken seriously ill , tragically passing away a week later			2
this meant @entity1 was in command when the pirates attacked			1
they decided to separate him from his colleagues			0
@entity1 remained under guard on the ship 's bridge while the remaining crew members were held in a small cabin roughly 14 meters across			1
" i spent all my highjacking life on the table like that ( pointing to a small dinner table ) without anything			0
" as the days and weeks passed , @entity1 began to talk to the leader of the pirates , eventually gaining his trust			1
he negotiated better conditions for the hostages as well as permission to go above deck to get some fresh air			0
" the crew was under control all the time			0
i insisted ( they ) must have a rest , must have a walk at the open air			0
because if a person lies ( down ) all the time , he will have a problem with his stomach			0
during these breaks , the crew would talk to each other and even plot to take on the pirates if the opportunity arose			2

@entity1 said his heart sank at this moment			2
free at last finally , on the february 5 , 2009 , an agreement with the pirates was reached which saw them receive $ 3.2 million , a fraction of what they originally asked for			2
they left , and the ship and crew free to go			0
for @entity1 , it signaled the end of four months of unrelenting pressure			1
" we could n't believe it , " he said of their moment of liberation			0
" we were afraid that the pirates when they left the vessel left some explosive			0
" " i asked the commander of the navy ( who boarded the @entity31 shortly after the pirates disembarked ) to check everything			1
he told us that everything was clear and all the pirates left the vessel			0
" the @entity31 sailed into the port of @entity40 , @entity41 , a few days later where @entity1 was reunited with his wife and family			1
on their return to @entity8 , the family resolved that @entity1 should seek a job that would be less unpredictable than life at sea			2
that decision has led @entity1 to @entity7 where he navigates vessels 10 times the size of his own into and out of the city 's harbor			1
but while he enjoys being close to his family , that itch for life at sea still remains			0
" sometimes when i dream i see the very clear water and my ship moving over the clear water in open sea , " he said			0
" but i spent at sea all of my life , 45 years ... ( and ) now i like my village , i like my job here			0
