-- it was supposed to be her birthday getaway , but it ended up being a miserable trip			1
@entity6 took two weeks off for her 30th birthday in september 2012 to visit @entity8 with her best friends			1
yet she could n't enjoy herself because of constant thigh chafing -- " i went through an entire bottle of @entity13 powder " -- and she hated how she looked in every photo			2
" all these girls were enjoying themselves in bikinis poolside , and there i was , trying to cover up and hide , " she remembers			2
@entity19 decided then and there that she was going to enjoy her future birthdays			2
the 5 - foot - 4 @entity23 , @entity24 , resident weighed 248 pounds at the time , which she attributes to a lifetime of bad eating habits			1
" growing up in the @entity28 , eating large portions at every meal was a must , " she said			2
" breakfast included bacon , eggs , sausage , pancakes and biscuits			2
lunch was some sort of fast food , and dinner included a three - course meal of fritters for appetizers , fried chicken , collard greens , macaroni and cheese , and corn bread			2
" then , of course , there was creamy banana pudding or homemade apple pie for dessert			2
@entity19 downloaded the " @entity58 to @entity57 " app and set two goals : run a @entity57 without stopping and lose 30 to 40 pounds			1
" when i started the program , i could n't run more than 30 seconds , " she wrote in her @entity59			1
" now i 'm running two or three @entity61 a week			1
somewhere along the way i fell in love with running			1
" she soon added @entity66 classes and other forms of cardio into the mix , meeting her original goal and steadily setting new ones , like getting below 200 pounds and improving her @entity57 time			1
slowly but surely , she was taking back her life			2
" trying to stick to this routine has taught me the importance of encouraging myself , because i did n't have a support system in the beginning , " @entity19 said			2
she also switched to a low - carb diet			2
now , she typically eats yogurt , hard boiled eggs and turkey bacon for breakfast ; chicken salad or tuna for lunch ; steak , fish with kale or baked chicken with green vegetables for dinner ; and cheese slices , nuts or @entity95 for a snack			0
she will take the occasional weekend off from her diet , though			0
" it 's what you do consistently that matters , " she said			0
by may of this year , @entity19 was down to 128 pounds , more than a 120 - pound transformation			1
despite being at it for almost two years and surpassing her goals , @entity19 said she still has good days and bad days			0
" i still have my demons internally that i 'm still working through , and even though i have lost weight , i look in the mirror and see flaws , " she said			1
running , she believes , has been key to her weight loss success			1
her routine often has her in bed at 9 p.m. and waking up at 3:30 a.m. to start on cardio and weight training at the gym			1
she then runs or takes fitness classes five nights a week			0
" we all have things we secretly want to try , but we either do n't have the courage , do n't have anybody to do it with , or we ca n't physically do it , " she said			0
" i always wanted to run a @entity57 but could n't walk a mile without dying			0
now i love running ! i do n't have to worry about breathing heavy after 30 seconds			1
" the main thing that keeps her going ? getting stopped by people who tell her that she has inspired them to get fit			0
she recently started her own program called @entity128 , which stands for " @entity129			1
" she says it 's all about " learning to live life with and on purpose			0
" she will often contact her @entity128 group to let them know when and where she will be running , to encourage them to come along			1
" i 've been overweight my whole life			0
never in a million years would i think i would be this active , let alone inspiring people to get active			0
" one of those people is @entity58 - to - @entity57 running pal @entity138 , who stayed with @entity19 at the back of the pack on runs early on to motivate her to keep going			1
now , after seeing @entity19 ' progress in races , @entity142 says the roles have reversed			0
" she has become a person i look to for continued motivation to keep myself on track , " she said			0
" her story and progress have inspired me , and i know it will inspire others as well			1
" @entity19 has gotten a huge boost of confidence from losing the extra pounds			1
" i want to go any and everywhere			0
any reason to buy a new outfit and shop , " she said			0
" when you feel good on the outside , you feel good on the inside			0
" she has big plans for her 32nd birthday in september			0
she wants to recreate some of those pictures from her miserable 30th -- this time with her new and improved self			0
