@entity0 -- @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity0 rejected tuesday a call for an independent investigation into the killings of hundreds of demonstrators by government forces			1
" @entity3 has a government , has a state , " @entity9 told reporters at the world body			1
" we can undertake any investigation by our own selves , with full transparency			1
we have nothing to hide			2
we regret what is going on , but you should also acknowledge that this unrest and riots , in some of their aspects , have hidden agendas			2
" @entity9 called president @entity25 a reformer who has been working to effect change by issuing decrees that , among other things , lifted the decades - old emergency law and allowed peaceful demonstrations			1
" if you demonstrate peacefully , you are protected by the government , " he said			2
" if you resort to violence , then any government in the world -- in order to maintain peace and order -- would utilize its forces to stop violence and vandalism and aggression against buildings as well as against innocent civilians			2
" @entity3 's own @entity47 has already undertaken an investigation into the violence against civilians and the military , and will issue its findings at a later date , he said			1
" so we are doing our homework ; we do n't need help from anybody			2
" he urged the @entity57 to rely on official reports , not on media reports			1
@entity9 's remarks came on the same day that the @entity61 reported that more than 400 people have died since march 18 in incidents linked to the government crackdown on protesters seeking reform			1
while the vast majority are apparently civilians , the group 's list describes a few of the dead as members of the army or police			1
the @entity0 has said it has information that 76 people were killed last week on friday alone , apparently during peaceful marches , and that the death toll from that day could be much higher			1
@entity1 can not independently confirm death tolls and witness accounts of the bloody crackdown			2
the @entity3 government has not granted @entity1 access to the country			2
@entity87 ambassador to the @entity0 @entity88 called the violence wielded by the government of @entity3 " abhorrent and deplorable , " adding , " the outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end , and now			2
" the @entity3 government 's repeal of its emergency law and allowance for peaceful demonstrations " were clearly not serious , given the continued violent repression against protesters , " she said			2
the @entity87 is pursuing " a range of possible policy options , " @entity102 said , including the imposition of additional sanctions			2
" the @entity3 people 's call for freedom of expression , association , peaceful assembly and the ability to choose their leaders freely must be heard , " she said			1
@entity102 accused @entity25 of " disingenuously blaming outsiders while , at the same time , seeking @entity117 assistance in repressing @entity3 's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by the @entity117 regime			2
" @entity0 @entity121 ban ki - moon , who called for the investigation , briefed the @entity57 on the situation tuesday			1
" i condemn utterly the continuing violence against the peaceful demonstrators , " @entity121 told reporters			2
" most particularly , the use of tanks and live fire			1
" @entity121 said the @entity57 would be briefed more fully on the matter on wednesday , when it meets in private session			1
he added that he had discussed the matter " at least " twice with @entity25			0
" it goes without saying that @entity3 authorities have an obligation to protect civilians and respect international human rights , " @entity121 told reporters			1
" that includes the right to free expression and peaceful assembly			0
" @entity149 's @entity0 director , @entity148 , called on the @entity57 to " condemn abuses by the @entity3 government , support an international investigation and sanction those ordering the shooting and torture of protesters			1
" he called @entity3 's campaign for a seat on the @entity154 " a slap in the face to the victims of the current crackdown , and an embarrassment to those who have supported its candidacy			0
" in state - run media , @entity25 's regime has described the protesters as " armed criminal groups " and said its soldiers and police were working to stop them			0
the government has discussed the burials of " martyrs " killed by those groups			1

" @entity308 , an analyst on the region with the @entity310 , said tuesday the response of the international community " is very important in terms of the legitimacy , in terms of the isolation of the @entity3 regime			0
but the reality is events in @entity3 will determine what will happen and the end results			0
@entity3 will determine whether the regime stays or goes			0
" obviously the regime has decided to crush the protesters , to silence the opposition , " @entity308 added			0
@entity326 is " using now massive force in order to break the will of the protesters			0
but even if he wins the first round , the situation is far from over ... the reality is president @entity25 will emerge as a much weakened president after his particular confrontation because he has lost much legitimacy and authority inside @entity3			0
