@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 is trying to talk about the issue of poverty , but the talk so far has produced more problems than solutions			1
trying to address the latest political snafu , the @entity9 @entity8 said he was " inarticulate " when he talked on a conservative radio program wednesday about a " tailspin of culture , in our inner cities in particular , of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work			1
" @entity2 , the head of the @entity22 and 2012 @entity8 vice presidential nominee , has begun to examine the issue of poverty over the past 18 months			1
he made the statements on @entity26 's " @entity25 " radio program			1
@entity29 rep. @entity28 called his statement " deeply offensive " and a " thinly veiled racial attack " and @entity33 minority leader @entity32 's press office called it " shameful			0
" but are @entity35 and @entity32 engaging in political double standards ? the scarlet ' r ' @entity38 , political science professor at @entity39 , said personal bias and perspective dictate their response			0
" rightly or wrongly , when republicans make comments about structural issues , that 's going to be perceived by some as paternalistic , " she said			1
@entity49 , who has known @entity2 for years and heads the @entity50 , an organization that works with people on the outskirts of society , said people " should earn a right to be critical " by either living in or working with impoverished communities			2
@entity57 fights for felon voting rights while @entity49 admires @entity2 's interest in poverty and his willingness to travel to some of the most difficult neighborhoods with him and his organization , he said the lawmaker has n't yet earned the right to be critical " at this point			1
" what about president @entity69 , who has made similar statements about the structural problems of race and poverty ? @entity69 's advantage at the launch of the new program " @entity79 , " tailored to help african - american and @entity77 youth succeed , @entity69 reeled off statistics that show minorities are more likely to be arrested and suspended from school and less likely to graduate			1
" and the worst part is , we 've become numb to these statistics , " @entity69 said last month , adding that people should not make excuses			2
in addition to @entity79 , attorney general @entity87 has made recent announcements that attempt to change the structural disadvantages facing people of color , including his support of a plan that would reduce prison sentences for some drug offenses			2
but it 's what a politician says and how he says it that matters			0
" it 's going to be received differently from a black @entity103 than from a white @entity8 , " @entity38 said			0
but criticism is n't reserved only for white @entity8			0
@entity69 not immune since @entity69 , a black man who grew up without a father and worked in inner city @entity107 , entered the national political scene , he has also been criticized for his rhetoric toward the black community			1
he was criticized by some for being patronizing after his commencement speech at @entity113 last year , where he advised students to help a fellow young black man and be a good father and spouse			0
and after his @entity120 address in 2008 , where he told black men to be involved in their children 's lives , rev. @entity118 was caught off camera saying @entity69 talks " down to black folks			2
" @entity126 says @entity127 should do more on poverty @entity2 's second strike @entity2 's comments , however , were doubly troubling to some because he referenced one of the most offensive authors on the issue of race and class			1
" you 're buddy @entity138 or @entity139 over at @entity140 -- those guys have written books on this , which is -- we have got this tailspin of culture , " @entity2 said to @entity26			1
@entity138 , a self - described " right - wing ideologue , " is the author of the book , " @entity148 , " which hypothesizes that @entity151 social and economic disadvantages are because they are less intelligent than whites			0
@entity38 said that if a politician is going to talk about race and poverty and wants to be taken serious , " do n't invoke the man that wrote ' @entity148			0
' " @entity49 , who worked at the conservative think tank , the @entity158 with @entity138 when " @entity148 " was released in 1994 , agreed , saying he constantly tells @entity2 to stop quoting conservative scholars because their polarizing rhetoric " seeps into his speeches			1
" " all of these guys ... do not talk to the people they write about , " @entity49 said			0
" the only thing they are passionate about is the failures of the poor			0
" @entity2 's recent interest in poverty is likely to culminate in policy proposals that are , based on his recent speeches , going to advocate fewer government - centered poverty programs			1
in a statement thursday , one day after his controversial remarks , @entity2 said he was trying to make a larger point : that " we can not settle for this status quo and that government and families have to do more and rethink our approach to fighting poverty			1
" this flare - up comes less than two weeks after he released a report analyzing 92 federal anti-poverty programs , concluding that are a confusing patchwork of often ineffective prescriptions to combating the problem			0
@entity49 says @entity2 's remarks damage his attempt to be authoritative on anti-poverty legislation and issues			2
it 's only " a minor setback , " he added			0
instead , @entity49 advised that @entity2 needs to talk about the people he has met in the communities he has visited			2
@entity2 did a version of that last week at the annual @entity199 where he told a story about a child who wanted to bring a brown bag lunch to school instead of receiving free lunch because it showed that someone cared			0
but that story was not true and he was forced to issue a correction .			0
