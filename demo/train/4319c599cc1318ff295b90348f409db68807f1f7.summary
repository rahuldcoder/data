-- sponsors of international soccer including @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have warned that an ethics scandal at the highest levels of the sport is hurting the sport and needs to be fixed			1
" the current situation is clearly not good for the game , " a @entity3 spokesman told @entity0 tuesday , echoing comments from other companies that pay to have their logos at the @entity15 and other major soccer events			2
the @entity3 spokesman declined to be named			0
" the negative tenor of the public debate around @entity22 at the moment is neither good for football nor for @entity22 , " @entity5 chief communications officer @entity19 told @entity0 tuesday			2
@entity22 president @entity26 held an extraordinary press conference amid the scandal monday night , insisting the organization was not in crisis after two top officials were suspended amid ethics concerns			1
never mind @entity34 , the system is to blame one of the officials , @entity37 , was the only person running against @entity26 for the presidency in an election scheduled for wednesday			2
@entity22 says the vote will go ahead on schedule , with @entity26 as the only candidate			1
the powerful @entity44 called on @entity22 tuesday to delay the vote			1
" this has been a very damaging time for the reputation of @entity22 and therefore the whole of football , " @entity44 president @entity46 said			1
the @entity52 echoed the call			0
" the events of the last two days , in particular , have made any election unworkable , " @entity52 head @entity54 said in a statement			0
@entity59 airlines said it was " disappointed " by the " issues around the administration " of @entity22 , and @entity4 said monday that the ethics allegations were " distressing and bad for the sport			2
" the concerns come as @entity26 shrugged off allegations of corruption within @entity22 monday and said he would press ahead with his bid to be re-elected as president for the fourth time			1
@entity37 of @entity70 was suspended by the @entity22 ethics committee sunday , along with fellow leading official @entity72			1
" we are not in a crisis , we are only in some difficulties and these can be solved inside our family , " @entity26 told a press conference monday where he was continually pressed on both his own position and wider allegations of wrongdoing within @entity22			1
" @entity22 is strong enough to deal with our own problems , " he asserted when asked if he had considered postponing wednesday 's vote by the 208 - member @entity83			1
@entity22 is the body that decides where soccer 's quadrennial @entity15 will be held , among other responsibilities			1
@entity26 ruled out a new vote on the venue for the @entity91 in @entity70 after a suggestion that it had won unfairly			2
" there is no issue for the @entity15 in 2022 , " the 75 - year - old @entity93 said			2
" i believe that the decision taken for the @entity15 in 2022 was done exactly in the same pattern and in the same way as the 2018 tournament			0
" @entity100 , who led the @entity70 bid , said earlier monday that he would appeal his suspension			0
" i am punished before i am found guilty , " @entity37 said in a statement , saying he would " not accept " the decision			0
@entity26 , who was cleared by the ethics committee , did admit that the whole affair had affected @entity22 's reputation			1
" what has happened in the last few days and week -- it has done great damage to the image of @entity22 , " he said			0
the press conference was conducted in an acrimonious atmosphere as frustrated journalists shouted out questions			0
" we 're not in a bazaar here , we are in an important congress , " retorted @entity26 at one point			0
it rounded off an extraordinary day of accusation and counter accusation , with @entity122 chief @entity72 the focal point			0
" at the end of the day , @entity26 has to be stopped , " @entity72 , whose organization covers @entity125 and @entity126 and the @entity127 , told gathered reporters , clearly angered by his expulsion from @entity22 's executive committee			1
@entity72 also released an e-mail to reporters which implied that @entity22 general secretary @entity135 believed there was corruption involved in @entity70 's successful bid to host the @entity91			2
" he thought he could buy @entity22 as they bought the @entity15 , " @entity72 claims @entity135 said of @entity37 in the e-mail			1
@entity70 's football association monday " categorically denied any wrongdoing " in connection with its bid , and said it was consulting lawyers and " urgently seeking clarification from @entity22 " about the alleged @entity135 comments			1
@entity135 , who is not accused of ethics violations and is not under any investigation , admitted sending the email , but said his comments had been taken out of context			0
@entity72 and @entity37 both deny wrongdoing			0
in a further puzzling development tuesday , @entity72 apparently performed a u-turn from his previous position and urged his region 's members in an open lettter to vote for @entity26			2
" at our last meeting we agreed as a @entity162 to support the incumbent @entity163 in his quest to regain the @entity165 , " @entity72 wrote			0
" i wish to assure you nothing has changed - our mandate was set then and despite it all we must fulfil it			0
" @entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
