-- in the mid- 1970s , @entity1 was studying psychology , international law and @entity4 at the @entity5 and singing with a local band on the side			1
she was planning to head to the @entity8 to further her studies			2
but then @entity10 swept her off her feet , and their band , the @entity13 , would soon sweep the nation with its @entity15 beat			2
@entity1 never made it to the @entity17 , but she launched an enduring musical career that has made her into a beloved international artist			1
thirty - five years later , she remains married to that first and only boyfriend			1
and the seven - time @entity22 winner has now released " the standards , " an album of classic @entity26 tunes with a @entity1 twist			1
it opens with " @entity29 , " and moves on to songs like " they ca n't @entity31 , " " @entity33 , " " @entity34 " and " @entity35			1
" the album , she said , brings her career back to some of those first shaky steps onto the national stage			1
" it 's such a natural thing for me , something that i wanted to do so long and 25 years ago when i danced the conga on ' @entity45			1
' i sang ' @entity29 ' with my piano player as a second song and this is like full circle , " @entity1 said			1
" that 's why it starts the record			1
" fans know her dance hits like " @entity15 , " " @entity54 , " " @entity55 " and " @entity56			2
" but there 's something about the ballads -- " @entity61 " , " higher " -- that make the heart ache			1
behind the big voice , the singer says she 's a mom who 's missing her daughter , who just left for college			1
she describes herself as analytical , " a klutz , " a boater with a captain 's license , a cook of " killer pancakes , " a great eyebrow plucker and the go - to diagnoser of maladies for her friends			1
" i 'm sure i was a doctor in some other life , because i 'm a good diagnostician			1
i listen and they call me and go ' hey this happened , what do you think ? what should i take ? ' " she said			2
" i 'm pretty spot - on on all that stuff			1
dr. @entity86 -- the doctor is in			2
" she says she 's still a student -- a woman who learns and evolves with every new phase in life			1
in this edited conversation , @entity1 tells @entity0 about why she made this album now , and about the life - threatening accident that helped to shape who she is			1
@entity0 : what can you tell your fans about why you did this new album ? @entity1 : i love this project -- it 's very close to my heart because it was music that really started inspiring me in so many ways when i was a kid			1
i was a kid ( who loved music ) , so i sang since i talked			2
when i was watching @entity104 and @entity105 ( and @entity106 ) as a little girl , i was really listening to the music			0
so this ... is what really led the way for me to do my ballads , and to write the music that i wrote			0
because most of the stuff i 've done really is the ballads			0
it came from ( the heart )			0
@entity0 : so it sounds like this emotional journey through your life			2
@entity1 : it is very much so			1
" @entity33 " is the first song i sang with @entity125 on october 25 of 1975 , my first professional gig			0
and we did it in disco , because @entity130 had just put out that version and it was killer and disco was superhot			0
but i chose that song for that reason			0
@entity0 : you were severely injured when your tour bus was involved in an accident in 1990 , and you performed an emotional tribute at the @entity141 in 1991			2
how would you describe who you were before and who you were after the accident ? @entity1 : i 'm the same person before and after , but i got to tell you , first of all my knees were knocking that day and i thought , ' people are still going to think i 'm still paralyzed and i really ca n't walk ! ' what 's different is this : i 'm very clear on the power of prayer and that fact that it is an energy that connects us			1
a good thought , not in a religious way , but just in ( an ) energy way			0
when you put out good thoughts and good feelings to other human beings , it gets there , and it really does affect you			0
and i internalized it and it was part of my recuperation			0
so , i learned that			2
i learned about a lot of discipline that i did n't know that i had			2
incredible amounts of patience i had to learn			0
and although i am that way , it grew exponentially			0
i learned to be a lot more expressive			2
it made my music more expressive because i realized that could have been it			0
i was very close to biting it at 32 years old			0
so i made it a point to really tell people how i feel about them and express -- if i love them , i tell them			0
my music became a lot more expressive , my way of emoting , ' cause music has always been my way of emoting ... i just let go			0
i let go a lot			0
the reason i said that this album could n't have been made before is because , even beyond that , everything i 've experienced until now , i feel so good in my own skin and i 'm so much more open and free and just able to let go of a million things that help when you 're doing something like these songs			1
@entity0 : so how does the diagnostician part of your identity reflect itself in this current album ? @entity1 : well , maybe because i 'm a control freak in certain things when it comes to work ! this is my first production top to bottom , it 's been my baby , everything from the idea , the picking of the songs , even the cover , all the photos			1
@entity0 : you and your husband , @entity214 , have spoken candidly about the political situation in @entity216 and your pride in your @entity219 - @entity26 roots			1
what are your thoughts on who you are as a @entity219 - @entity26 woman now , versus when you began ? @entity1 : i think it 's important that we maintain our culture -- all of us , not just @entity227			1
you 're only stronger if you really know where you came from and you have so much to offer			0
( if ) my parents had not kept alive ( our @entity219 heritage ) , our music would n't have been the same			0
what we did never would have come to fruition because it would n't have occurred to us to have that vocabulary			0
that became what made us stand out in the ' 80s : that " @entity15 , " " @entity56			0
" because we were raised on this stuff			0
i think it 's important to know your roots and to keep them			2
it only enriches us as human beings , and makes us stronger and better			0
and you know , little by little , everyone will be more accepting .			0
