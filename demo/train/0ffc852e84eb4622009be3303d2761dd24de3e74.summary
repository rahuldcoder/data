@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday announced the creation of a comprehensive administration initiative devoted to spurring development efforts around the globe			1
@entity2 calls it new @entity9 @entity8 and says it 's the " first of its kind by an @entity9 administration			1
" " put simply , the @entity9 is changing the way we do business , " @entity2 said at the summit of the @entity15 , an ambitious agenda world leaders set 10 years ago to tackle global poverty , which has grown amid the world economic recession			1
the program has four approaches			2
one is changing the definition of development			1
" for too long , we 've measured our efforts by the dollars we spent and the food and medicines that we delivered			1
but aid alone is not development			1
development is helping nations to actually develop , moving from poverty to prosperity			1
and we need more than just aid to unleash that change			2
we need to harness all the tools at our disposal , from our diplomacy to our trade to our investment policies , " he said			2
second , the administration is changing how " the ultimate goal of development " is viewed			1
" our focus on assistance has saved lives in the short term , but it has n't always improved those societies over the long term			2
consider the millions of people who have relied on food assistance for decades			2
that 's not development , that 's dependence , and it 's a cycle we need to break			1
instead of just managing poverty , we have to offer nations and peoples a path out of poverty			2
" @entity2 said that the @entity9 will " partner with countries that are willing to take the lead " and that the time when " development was dictated by foreign capitals has come to an end			1
" " @entity9 has been , and will remain , the global leader in providing assistance			1
we will not abandon those who depend on us for life - saving help , whether it 's food or medicine			2
we will keep our promises and honor our commitments , " he said			2
but , he emphasized that creating the conditions where assistance is no longer needed is what is needed now			2
" so we will seek partners who want to build their own capacity to provide for their people			0
we will seek development that is sustainable			1
" the third pillar is putting an emphasis on " broad - based economic growth , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's the force that turned @entity95 from a recipient of aid to a donor of aid			0
it 's the force that has raised living standards from @entity101 to @entity102			0
and it 's the force that has allowed emerging @entity104 countries like @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 to defy the odds and make real progress toward achieving the @entity15 , even as some of their neighbors -- like @entity113 -- have lagged behind			0
" @entity2 said the @entity9 will reach out to countries that are moving to democracy from authoritarianism			1
" the people of @entity118 , for example			0
show that even after years of war , great progress can be achieved			0
and as others show the courage to put war behind them -- including , we hope , in @entity122 -- the @entity9 will stand with those who seek to build and sustain peace			1
" @entity2 said the fourth pillar is insisting " on more responsibility -- from ourselves and from others			1
" he said the administration will work with @entity134 " to better match our investments with the priorities of our partner countries			0
guided by the evidence , we will invest in programs that work and end those that do n't			0
" he urged donor nations to honor commitments and developing countries to make the tough choices			0
" no one nation can do everything everywhere and still do it well			0
to meet our goals , we must be more selective and focus our efforts where we have the best partners and where we can have the greatest impact			2
and just as this work can not be done by any one government , it ca n't be the work of governments alone			0
in fact , foundations , the private sector and ngos are making historic commitments that have redefined what 's possible			0
" as for the goals to eradicate poverty , @entity2 said , no one can deny the progress that has been made , citing better education , the drop in diseases such as hiv / aids , more access to drinking water and ending poverty for many			1
at the same time , he says , " progress towards other goals has not come nearly fast enough			0
" he cites problems like malnutrition , hunger and women " who lose their lives every year simply giving birth			0
" @entity2 stressed the facts that development is n't charity and that some countries are " condemned to perpetual poverty			1
" he said progress is possible and practical			0
" i suspect that some in wealthier countries may ask , with our economies struggling , so many people out of work , and so many families barely getting by , why a summit on development ? the answer is simple : in our global economy , progress in even the poorest countries can advance the prosperity and security of people far beyond their borders , including my fellow @entity9			1
" the policy was unveiled after a year - long review ordered by @entity2 in an effort to examine how @entity9 aid dollars can be more effectively targeted after the world recession , a senior administration official said			1
" the policy is about real attention to focus and selectively , " the official explained			0
" we can not spread limited resources so thinly across every nation			0
" upon taking office , @entity2 promised to double @entity9 foreign aid to $ 50 million by 2012 and make @entity9 programs , accused of being riddled with waste and fraud , more effective			1
during the foreign aid review , secretary of state @entity222 argued for more control over development policy and control over the @entity227 , arguing that diplomacy and development go hand - in - hand			2
in the end , the @entity232 will maintain oversight of @entity227 , but as evidence of the new importance of development , the @entity235 is establishing a " deputies committee " to coordinate policy across the @entity9 government , the official said			1
while @entity227 will continue to be the premier agency for delivering development aid , the official said , the new strategy offers a " whole - of - government approach , " integrating development aid currently handled by about two dozen federal agencies and departments			2
countries selected for @entity9 development attention also will get assistance with technical innovation and trade			1
selection of countries will be primarily based on evidence of strong governance and economic policy , but other factors to be involved are where donors are currently directing their aid and where the private sector is investing , so as not to duplicate effort			0
two countries singled out for possible inclusion are @entity269 and @entity270			0
the strategy builds on the @entity272 , a @entity273 administration program that encourages political and economic stability by making multimillion - dollar investment in nations that offer plans for reform			0
the official said that although the new policy focuses on more stable countries , the administration does not want to send a signal that the most vulnerable countries , such as @entity285 , will be ignored			0
" we are not walking away , " the official said			0
" we will still have a commitment to improving humanitarian conditions and helping countries suffering from natural disasters and conflict			0
" @entity1 's @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
