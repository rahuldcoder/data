-- there will be no new gun laws after the @entity3 shooting for the basic reason that the @entity6 people do not want them			1
over the past 20 years , support for gun control has collapsed in the @entity6			1
three - quarters of @entity6 want to keep the right to own handguns , weapons whose only function is to kill human beings at close range			1
in 1959 , 60 % of @entity6 wanted handguns banned outright for all but police officers			1
little to gain , lots to lose for @entity20 and @entity21 on guns responding to public opinion , states have loosened gun laws to allow citizens to carry weapons with them almost anywhere they go			1
in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , it 's legal to carry a gun into a bar			0
guns and booze : what could go wrong ? but here 's the odd thing : at the same time as @entity6 have become more enthusiastic about gun rights , fewer and fewer @entity6 actually want to own a gun themselves			1
in the 1990s , the proportion of @entity6 who kept a gun in the home tumbled from one - half to one - third			1
and while gun ownership has risen in the @entity20 years , it remains lower than in the 1960s when strong majorities of the @entity6 people demanded stricter laws			1
how can we make sense of this weird divergence between beliefs and behavior ? @entity6 support gun rights because they believe guns are necessary for self - protection			1
as the @entity29 lawmaker who introduced the law allowing guns to be carried in bars explained : " folks were being robbed , assaulted -- it was becoming an issue of personal safety			0
the police are n't going to be able to protect you			0
they 're going to be checking out the crime scene after you and your family 's been shot or injured or assaulted or raped			0
" at the same time , people hesitate to own guns themselves because they recognize that keeping a gun in the house is a dangerous thing to do			1
a gun in the house minimally doubles the risk that a household member will kill himself or herself			0
( some studies put the increase in suicide risk as high as 10 times			0
) an @entity6 is 50 % more likely to be shot dead by his or her own hand than to be shot dead by a criminal assailant			2
more than 30,000 @entity6 injure themselves with guns every year			2
the good news is that as @entity6 becomes safer , fewer and fewer americans feel the need for a weapon			1
the overall violent crime index has tumbled by one - third since the early 1990s			0
the worst crimes -- murder and rape -- have declined even more			0
@entity6 citizens are safer today from crime than at almost any time since record - keeping began , very likely safer than at any time in the history of the country			1
@entity6 perceive these improvements in the safety of their immediate neighborhood			2
back in the early 1980s , half of @entity6 said they feared to walk alone at night near their own homes			2
by the early 2000s , only one - third expressed such fears			0
( those fears have ticked up a little in the last few years , even as crime rates continue to fall , but again they remain way below historic peaks			0
) yet unfortunately , @entity6 are not , however , nearly so accurate at assessing national trends			2
in the mid- 2000s , when crime rates were declining fast , almost 70 % of @entity6 wrongly said that crime rates had risen over the past year			2
analysis : why gun controls are off the agenda in @entity6 what force on earth could convince @entity6 that down is up ? the most powerful force of all : television			1
tv news -- and especially local tv news -- is dominated by news of violent crime , the more spectacular and murderous the better			1
tv news creates a false picture of a country under attack by rampaging criminals , and especially nonwhite criminals			1
the people who watch the most tv news , @entity6 older than 50 , also happen to be the group most likely to own a gun			1
only one - fifth of young @entity6 own a gun ; one - third of over- 50 @entity6 do			1
@entity141 are twice as likely to own a gun as @entity143			0
maybe not so coincidentally , @entity141 are more likely to watch the scariest news channel of them all : @entity145			0
whites are twice as likely to own a gun as nonwhites -- and it may also not be a coincidence that gun purchases have suddenly spiked since november 2008			0
proponents of gun control are baffled that horrific massacres such as the one in @entity3 , @entity154 , do not lead to stricter gun control			1
they have their causation backward			0
the more terrifyingly criminal the world looks , the more ineffective law enforcement seems , the more @entity6 demand the right to deadly weapons with which to defend themselves			2
it is local tv programming directors , not the @entity163 , who are tirelessly persuading @entity6 that they need to strap a gun to their legs before heading to the mall			1
and what will change those attitudes is not more atrocity stories , but instead the reassuring truth : the @entity6 is safe and getting safer , safer than ever before in its history			2
the police can protect you , and will , and do			0
and a gun in the house is not a guarantee of personal security -- it is instead a standing invitation to family tragedy			0
the cold dead hands from which they pry the gun are very unlikely to be the hands of a heroic minuteman defending home and hearth against intruders			2
they are much more likely to be the hands of a troubled adolescent or a clumsy child			0
in the land of the @entity197 , nobody will take your guns away			0
but if you love your children , you should get rid of them voluntarily			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 says public support for stricter gun control has steadily waned
despite gun views , fewer @entity6 today keep a gun in their home , he says
@entity203 says people realize that gun ownership is risky to themselves and their families
@entity217 : local tv news *overplays* violence , drives up fear , keeps people *focused* on gun rights
