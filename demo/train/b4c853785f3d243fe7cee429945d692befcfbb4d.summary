@entity0 -- in a lawsuit challenging the federal no - fly list , a @entity3 @entity2 in @entity4 has ruled that passengers have a constitutional right to fly internationally , but it has yet to decide if the government 's procedures are enough to deny that right due to security concerns			1
the 13 plaintiffs , including four @entity3 military veterans , sued in 2010 after being stopped from traveling in aircraft			1
they say they believe they are on the federal no - fly list			1
they also say they were prevented from traveling overseas to make religious pilgrimages , visit family and attend school , since other means of travel , such as boat trips that would have lasted more than a month , were impractical			1
the @entity25 , which supported the case , hailed the partial decision as a victory			2
" this is the first federal court decision to recognize that when the government bans @entity3 from flying and smears them as suspected terrorists , it deprives them of constitutionally protected liberties and must provide these @entity3 a fair process to clear their names , " @entity29 , a staff attorney for the @entity25 who argued the case , told @entity1			2
the @entity38 would not comment on the case			2
the plaintiffs also say the government violated their right to due process when they were put on the list with no notice or meaningful way to fight the inclusion			0
about 20,000 people were on the no - fly list as of 2012 , according to a counterterrorism official , including about 400 @entity3			1
@entity3 officials will not confirm who is on the no - fly list or various other terrorist watch lists complied by the @entity54 and used by the @entity55 , airlines and other countries			1
the judge has asked both the government and the plaintiffs ' attorneys for more information about the redress process before deciding if the procedures are enough to prevent people from flying			0
there is a process for removing a person 's name by submitting information to the @entity71			0
if would - be passengers are n't happy with the results , they can take the government to court			0
the plaintiffs said that process is not adequate , since the government never holds an administrative hearing , acknowledges if a person 's name is on the list or if it has been removed , or tells why the name was on the list in the first place			0
the government argued in court documents that it ca n't tell people if they are on the no - fly list because that would reveal classified information that needs to be " shared across the government to maximize the nation 's security , without fear that such information will be disclosed whenever anyone can not travel as he or she might choose			2
" the next court date is set for september 9			0
