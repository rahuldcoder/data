-- dressing for work can be a battle , but only if you do n't know what you 're doing			1
the way you look and dress in the office makes a statement about what people can expect from you and how you feel about yourself			1
here are five areas you should focus on when it comes to having great work style , from the viewpoints of both a man and woman			1
remember , every company 's culture and dress code are different , so follow our advice as it applies to your workplace			1
accessories she says : every woman knows that accessories define what look you 're going for , whether it 's elegant , trendy or casual			1
if you put 100 women in a room together wearing the same black dress , no two of them would look the same			1
why ? because they would all accessorize differently			2
they 'd have to -- it 's how you set yourself apart from everyone else			1
this can be applied at work , too , especially if you work somewhere where everyone wears a different variation of the same outfit			1
as a general rule , limit yourself to 11 or fewer accessories , and always err on the side of caution and simplicity			1
if it 's excessively cute , big or loud -- just say no. he says : men do n't usually wear as many fashion accessories as women , aside from a watch and perhaps a ring			1
just remember to keep it simple			0
you should have more fingers without rings than with			0
and your watch should look professional , which means a leather band should n't be cracked or its silver links should n't be full of scratches			0
pay just as much attention to your briefcase or laptop case			1
if your carrying case is leather , make sure it 's not cracked and falling apart			0
a cloth one should n't be covered in dirt or political buttons			1
facial appearance she says : what 's that they say ? " beauty is in the eye of the beholder ? " while it 's true that beauty ca n't be defined , it 's also true that looking ridiculous can -- and that 's the last thing you want a client or colleague to think about you			1
when you 're choosing an outfit , you look for something that complements your features , right ? the same goes for your makeup , only on a more subtle level			0
do n't wear red lipstick and leave the rest of your face bare			0
do n't highlight your baby blues with 100 coats of mascara			0
and please , please -- leave the blue , turquoise , bright green ( and all other jewel - tone ) eye shadows for next @entity104			1
he says : for guys , facial hair is the real conundrum			0
showing up to work clean - shaven is always appropriate			1
a well - groomed beard can look just as professional , but you have to be meticulous about keeping it trimmed or you risk looking like your chin is growing a @entity115 pad			1
the in - between stages and styles , such as 5 o'clock shadows or week - old scruff , are fine for some workplaces and forbidden in others			1
remember that you 're a regular person going to work , not a rock star going onstage			1
they can get away with looking like unkempt college students			0
if you ca n't find an explicit policy in the company handbook , take a cue from the other men in the office			1
hygiene she says : i 'm not sure that this one needs too much explanation , so we 'll keep it simple : 1			0
please bathe , if not daily , at least every other day			0
your makeup never looks as good after it 's been slept in and reapplied as when you do it fresh every day			0
please wash your hair , or at the very least , brush it			0
while we 're washing things , give those clothes a good scrub , too			0
please brush your teeth , as no one wants to smell your morning - coffee / last - night 's - happy - hour breath			1
the bottom line is that , when given a choice , colleagues and clients will be more apt to interact with people who look neat and smell great			0
the last thing you want is to have your pungent aroma be the topic of water - cooler conversation			1
he says : let 's assume you bathe and brush your teeth regularly -- if not , we 've got a whole separate set of issues			1
one important problem that continually plagues men is cologne : go easy on it , please			0
i think everyone understands you 're trying to smell good , but do n't suffocate everyone with your fragrance , even if it is by a fancy designer			0
many people are allergic to colognes , so skipping it altogether might not be a bad idea			2
if you do decide to dab a little on , keep it very light			0
remember that just about everything is scented these days , so between your cologne , laundry detergent , fabric softener , hair product and deodorant , you 're a cornucopia of fragrance			0
overall outfit she says : women have several options when it comes to work attire and we should be grateful for that			2
what to wear to the office hinges on several things : your company culture and dress code , current trends , the climate and your personal style			1
what 's important is finding a style that works for you , your company and your budget			0
whether it 's a pair of jeans with a white t - shirt , a blazer and a pair of pumps ; or a pencil skirt with a button - front shirt and pantyhose , your outfit is a reflection of your personality , which in turn can reflect your work style			1
whatever you do , make sure your outfit is in line with the company dress code and whatever is on the day 's agenda			2
he says : here 's a situation where men generally have fewer options than women			2
you can go dressy ( a suit ) , business casual ( pants or nice jeans and a button - up shirt ) or very casual ( plain jeans and a tee )			2
look at what others are wearing to see what you can and ca n't get away with at the office			2
if individuality is appreciated , feel free to be a little more daring than you would be if you were a trial lawyer			0
even in a reserved office , a colorful pocket square or a bright tie can stand out and give you a little personality			2
what matters most is that you always appear pulled together and professional			0
in a relaxed business setting , even a plain black tee and jeans can look professional as long as they 're not wrinkled , ripped or ill - fitting			2
shoes she says : some might say that shoes are considered an accessory , but not this girl			0
if you ask me , your shoes make your outfit			0
the other day , for example , a woman in the elevator was wearing a short dress , fishnet - patterned pantyhose and a headband with a huge flower on the side			1
the kicker was her shoes : four - inch , patent - leather , peep - toe platforms that tied around her ankle with satin ribbon			2
with a few tweaks here and there , the outfit could have worked , but her shoes made her look like she belonged at a @entity104 party or street corner instead of the office			1
basic rule of thumb for shoes at work ? pick something practical over something cute , and be careful when it comes to flip - flops and sandals			1
he says : contrary to a woman 's ensemble , shoes rarely make a man 's outfit , but they can often break it			0
if you see a guy wearing a wrinkled suit and a tie with a big soup stain on it , you do n't remember what shoes he wore			0
but if you see a guy wearing an impeccably tailored @entity307 suit with dirty tennis shoes , you wo n't be able to forget the footwear			0
when going for a conservative , professional appearance , stick with basic black or brown dress shoes that are free of scuffs or caked mud			2
if your attire is more casual , just make sure your shoes are appropriate for that outfit , which might include funky tennis shoes for an employee at a laid - back marketing firm			2
what matters is that the shoes match your overall image and that they look clean			2
even the most relaxed boss does n't want your work shoes to look like they 've run a marathon			2

how you dress for work should depend on the culture at your office
she says : 11 or fewer accessories , save garish eye shadow for @entity104
he says : briefcase should be clean , not covered with political buttons
both say : bad smells are a no - no -- either body odor or too much perfume
