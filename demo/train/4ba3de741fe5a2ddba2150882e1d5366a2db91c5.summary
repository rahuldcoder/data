-- the @entity1 used its laser to " interrogate " a @entity4 rock sunday in what @entity5 said was " target practice " for future experiments			1
it was the first time such a powerful laser has been used on another planet and comes two weeks after the mobile science lab touched down on @entity4			1
a fist - sized rock dubbed " @entity14 " -- or @entity15 for scientists keeping count -- was zapped 30 times over 10 seconds with 14 millijoules of energy in each pulse , @entity5 said			1
" each pulse delivers more than a million watts of power for about five one - billionths of a second , " a @entity5 statement said			0
@entity27 plans to launch @entity4 orbiter @entity1 's @entity29 , short for @entity30 , recorded the resulting glowing , ionized gas in an effort to identify chemical elements in the rock , which was about 10 feet away			1
@entity35 , the @entity29 deputy project scientist watching at the @entity36 en @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , called the quality of the information gathered " surprising			0
" " it 's so rich , we can expect great science from investigating what might be thousands of targets with @entity29 in the next two years , " @entity35 said			1
@entity29 " got a great spectrum " to analyze , said @entity47 of the @entity48			0
" our team is both thrilled and working hard , looking at the results			0
after eight years building the instrument , it 's payoff time ! " curiosity began a two - year mission on @entity4 on august 6 and has been beaming back images of the surface of @entity58 ever since			1
it is loaded with 10 instruments " to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside @entity58 has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life , " @entity5 said			0
more space coverage on @entity64 @entity5 's @entity65 said friday that @entity1 's first driving destination will be @entity67 , about 1,300 feet from the rover 's landing site			1
" we had a bunch of strong contenders			0
it is the kind of dilemma planetary scientists dream of , but you can only go one place for the first drilling for a rock sample on @entity4 , " said project scientist @entity73			2
" that first drilling will be a huge moment in the history of @entity4 exploration			2
" the rover 's primary target is @entity87 , a peak about 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) away			0
but moving about a football field a day , with lengthy stops , it could take nearly a year to reach the slopes at the base of the mountain			0
