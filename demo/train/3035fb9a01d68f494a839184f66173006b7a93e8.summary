@entity0 -- the @entity2 voted on thursday to overcome a @entity4 - led filibuster against tougher gun laws , clearing the way for a major congressional debate on a package of proposals sought by president @entity10 in the aftermath of the @entity13 school massacre			1
the procedural vote followed a breakthrough by sens. @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 , @entity19 , who reached a compromise on broadening background checks to include private purchases at gun shows and on the @entity24			1
because of the bipartisan deal , @entity25 backing the legislation received support from enough republicans to approve the cloture motion , 68 - 31 , setting up debate on the proposals and amendments expected to last for two weeks			1
senate majority leader @entity34 , @entity35 , pledged after the key vote to let both sides offer amendments			0
but he insisted they include an updated ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons and a limit on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds			0
why we 're still debating guns both proposals were part of @entity10 's desired legislation , but were dropped from the package brought to the @entity2 because they would have prevented @entity25 from overcoming the @entity4 filibuster			1
while just a procedural vote , the @entity2 action represented a major step for @entity10 and @entity25 in ensuring public votes on the most significant gun legislation to reach the @entity2 floor in almost two decades			1
the powerful firearms lobby led by the @entity60 opposes the gun - control package and made clear it will seek political retribution on any legislator that supports it			1
this included thursday 's vote on launching debate			2
despite the agreement forged by @entity16 and @entity18 , both rated as strong supporters of gun rights by the @entity60 , the prospects for significant gun legislation to win congressional approval remained uncertain			1
any measure passed would then go to the @entity4 - led @entity77 , where @entity4 leaders have indicated resistance to the kind of proposals sought by @entity10			1
on thursday , house speaker @entity82 stopped short of promising his chamber would vote on gun legislation , saying he first has to see what gets sent over from the @entity2			1
" i fully expect that the @entity77 will act in some way , shape or form , " @entity82 told reporters			2
" but to make a blanket commitment without knowing what the underlying bill is , i think would be irresponsible on my part			0
the @entity2 has to produce a bill , and i 've made clear , if they produce a bill , we will review it and take it from there			2
" the @entity60 clearly rejected the proposed legislation so far , with @entity98 , who heads the group 's institute for legislative action , saying in a letter to the @entity2 that it " would unfairly infringe upon the @entity104 rights of law - abiding gun owners " and that the group " unequivocally opposed " it			1
the lives shattered by bullets @entity98 's letter called the compromise by @entity16 and @entity18 " misguided " and added that thursday 's procedural vote would be included in its assessment of legislators that serves as political ammunition in election campaigns			0
two @entity25 from pro-gun states up for re-election next year -- @entity120 of @entity121 and @entity122 of @entity123 -- voted with 29 republicans attempting to filibuster the legislation			2
sixteen @entity4 joined 52 @entity25 and @entity125 in supporting a floor debate			2
@entity77 spokesman @entity127 told reporters that @entity10 called relatives of @entity130 , @entity13 , shooting victims who were in @entity0 for the vote to thank them for their efforts to pressure @entity134 to take up the gun proposals			1
an earlier statement by more than 30 relatives of the 20 first graders and six educators killed in the massacre last december criticized senators for their attempted filibuster , saying they " should be ashamed of their attempt to silence efforts to prevent the next @entity147 tragedy			0
" in an emotional scene wednesday , @entity16 choked up while meeting with some of the @entity130 residents who praised him for political courage in taking on the @entity60			2
" you give me more legislative strength than you know , " @entity16 said at one point			0
he later was unable to speak and reached for a tissue when asked by a reporter how the @entity130 families affected his role in the negotiations with @entity18 and others			0
before the play date , the gun talk following the @entity130 shootings by a lone gunman , @entity10 called for a series of proposals including " universal " background checks on all gun purchases			1
currently , the federal law requiring background checks covers licensed firearms dealers , with private sales excluded			2
fierce opposition by the @entity60 and its allies in @entity134 -- mostly conservative @entity4 but also some @entity176 from gun - friendly states -- made clear that the universal checks sought by @entity10 had no chance of passing , leading to efforts by @entity16 , @entity18 and others to work out a compromise			1
in announcing the compromise on wednesday , @entity16 noted the proposal meant that firearms buyers at gun shows would face the same background check currently required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers			2
in addition , it would close a loophole that exempts intrastate gun sales on the @entity24 from requiring a background check , he said			2
addressing concerns of the @entity60 that expanding background checks would burden law - abiding gun owners seeking to trade or gift weapons in a personal transfer , @entity16 declared that " personal transfers are not touched whatsoever			1
" another provision would recognize the legitimacy of concealed weapons permits across state lines			0
the @entity16 - @entity18 compromise also would require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the " violently mentally ill " to the national background check system , addressing a criticism by the @entity60 and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information			1
@entity217 makes emotional entrance into gun debate in addition , the plan calls for a new @entity222 on @entity223 to report in six months on " all aspects of the problem , including guns , school safety , mental health , and violent media or video games			0
" the @entity60 contends that an expanded background check system would create a paper trail that could eventually be used to build a national gun registry , which they reject as unconstitutional			2
it also argues that an expanded system would prove a burden to law - abiding gun owners while doing nothing to stop criminals from getting hold of firearms			0
according to a summary of the compromise proposal , it includes language that prohibits creation of a national gun registry or misusing information from background checks			1
the @entity60 said rejection of the universal checks sought by @entity10 was " a positive development , " and it called for " serious and meaningful solutions " to gun violence instead of " blaming law - abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers			1
" why is this so hard ? the disconnect on background checks meanwhile , @entity10 said there were aspects of the @entity16 - @entity18 compromise that he would like to see strengthened			1
" but the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress			0
it recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue , and we do n't have to agree on everything to know that we 've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence , " the president said in a statement wednesday			0
" @entity134 needs to finish the job , " @entity10 added , saying he would continue " asking the @entity147 people to stand up and raise their voices because these measures deserve a vote			0
" other reaction ranged from cautious support to angry rejection			0
the @entity286 , named after the former @entity77 press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt on president @entity289 , called the compromise a " good step forward , " while @entity293 gov. @entity292 described it as " better than nothing " but a sellout to the gun lobby			2
" this is a @entity134 that is captive of the extremists and there is no clearer proof of that than this , " @entity292 said on the " @entity298 " radio show , adding that the compromise meant " we are not talking about a significant package of gun control anymore			0
" should anyone be able to buy guns ? share your views @entity10 has made gun measures a major focus of his second - term agenda , holding events across the country to push for @entity134 to vote on the package			1
opinion : why the @entity60 fights background checks a new national survey showed that 86 % of @entity321 support some expansion of background checks			1
at the same time , the @entity1 / @entity325 poll released wednesday also showed a majority of respondents fear that increased background checks would lead to a federal registry of gun owners that could allow the government to take away legally owned weapons			1
failing to pass new gun laws would be a stinging defeat for @entity10 and @entity25			0
however , a public perception that @entity4 blocked popular proposals , such as expanding background checks , could harm @entity4 prospects in 2014 and 2016 among moderates they need in their corner to have any chance of countering strong support for @entity25 by minority demographics such as @entity321 , @entity344 and the gay - lesbian vote			1
the @entity346 passed a package of gun laws proposed by @entity10 after the @entity130 attack by a lone gunman			0
proposals in the committee 's package included expanding background checks on gun buyers , toughening laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , banning semiautomatic rifles modeled after military assault weapons as well as large - capacity ammunition magazines , and coming up with ideas for improving school safety			1
@entity34 dropped the weapons ban , which would update a similar 1994 law that expired a decade later , saying it lacked enough support to overcome a filibuster			0
background checks on gun sales : how do they work ? some states already have passed stricter gun laws similar to the federal proposals since the @entity130 shootings			1
they include @entity13 , where the killings occurred , and @entity378 , the site of two other notorious mass shootings that contributed to a renewed gun debate in @entity147			0
the current background check system was created in 1989			0
it requires federally approved gun dealers to check whether gun buyers have a criminal background or other problem to make them ineligible to purchase a firearm			0
under the system , the gun dealer maintains a record of the transaction , but the federal government keeps no such identifying paperwork			0
according to a @entity399 report , less than 2 % of those seeking to purchase firearms were denied because of background checks from 1998 through 2009			2
opponents cite that figure as evidence that the system fails to stop illegal weapons sales that the legislation seeks to target , while supporters say the result shows the system keeps some guns out of the hands of the wrong people and the system should be expanded and strengthened			0
for @entity412 , a wounded life has a new purpose @entity1 's @entity414 , @entity415 , @entity416 , @entity417 and @entity418 contributed to this report .			0
