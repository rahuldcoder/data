-- @entity1 takes pictures of her neighborhood as part of @entity5			0
among @entity1 's photos of piles of trash , abandoned lots and barbed wire fences is a striking picture : large advertisements for " special prices " of cigarettes promising " @entity15 -- be true " that greet her on her way to shop for food			2
a recent analysis of federal data by the @entity22 found that as smoking declines at a fast rate in more affluent communities , the rates are staying the same among the poor and working class			1
more people are smoking in poorer communities			1
it is easy to blame people in poverty for making bad choices			1
but it 's more complicated than that			0
tobacco companies target these communities to encourage the habit , and the stresses of living in poverty and sometimes hopelessness also cause people to turn to cigarettes			1
witness to @entity45 works with the real experts -- mothers and caregivers of young children who have gone hungry and live in poverty			2
@entity1 , who chooses not to use her last name , talks openly about the stress of her environment : " when i go to the supermarket , it 's uncomfortable			0
... it 's embarrassing to pull my access card out			0
i feel like the other people in the line are just looking and judging , saying things ... " as pediatricians at @entity62 , we know to define what is symptom of the disease , such as a cough , and what is the underlying disease to be treated , the pneumonia			2
we do n't just suppress the cough with syrups ; we treat the underlying infection with antibiotics			0
in this case , poverty may be as much the symptom as the disease , given how much the chronic stress of poverty drives unhealthy behaviors			2
there are underlying factors that must be addressed before tobacco use can be substantially reduced in all communities			2
first , tobacco companies target low - income neighborhoods with more cigarette advertising : larger signs , and three times as many brand ads. tobacco manufacturers also specifically target young people in lower socioeconomic and minority neighborhoods and sell cheaper cigarettes in poor communities			1
this is an unconscionable strategy on the part of @entity97			1
another factor is that economic hardships , such as hunger , unstable housing and problems keeping the heat on are stressful and unhealthy for children			0
and childhood adversity is linked to unhealthy behaviors later , particularly to smoking			2
a @entity108 study found that " worries about paying bills or needing to sell possessions for cash independently erode a child 's self - control , regardless of strong parenting			2
" that lack of self - control often leads to smoking			1
women are quitting cigarettes at a lower rate than men			0
but women who are abused either physically or psychologically by their partners often smoke to cope with their tough lives			0
strikingly , these connections between violence exposure and smoking can be seen in low - income women and in higher socioeconomic groups as well			1
single mothers in poor neighborhoods are more likely to experience " double jeopardy , " with a high burden of childcare responsibilities coupled with social isolation and the chronic stress associated with neighborhood poverty			1
smoking can be a reliable strategy to soften those burdens			1
the geography of opportunity and disadvantage is not equal across @entity144			0
clearly public health programs such as tobacco taxes and smoke - free public places and housing have worked in reducing smoking rates , but it seems poorer communities are being overlooked			1
smoking is the top cause of preventable deaths in the @entity144			0
it causes lung cancer , heart disease , bronchitis , emphysema and more -- expensive health crises to add to the problems of the poor			0
to prevent smoking and keep young people from starting , it will take more than public health messages			1
it will require changing our economic policies to improve our neighborhood living conditions			0
people need well - paying jobs and safe communities to reduce the stress that often underlies smoking			1
until we get real about the emotional toll of living in neighborhoods that offer little hope or help and stop the strong promotion of cigarettes , smoking will continue to be one strategy for coping among the most vulnerable members of our society			1
note : an earlier version of this column did not make it clear that billboards advertising cigarettes are banned			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

smoking is not declining in poor communities as it is in more affluent places
writers : @entity97 targets low - income neighborhoods , sells cheap cigarettes
they say stresses of poverty and hopelessness cause people to turn to smoking
writers : smoking will be coping strategy until social ills of poverty are *overcome*
