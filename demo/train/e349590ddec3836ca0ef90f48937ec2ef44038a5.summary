-- it 's been just over two weeks since the @entity2 parachuted into @entity4 's @entity3 , her apricot dress flapping in the breeze , to the cheers of thousands in the stadium and millions at home watching the 2012 @entity10			1
since then , a potent mix of skill , stamina and resolve turned what appeared on paper as a packed sporting schedule into real - life drama , sorting the best from those who can still only dream of reaching the top			1
the hard - fought victories and stunning record - breaking performances by seasoned and new sporting superstars -- including @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 -- will lead many lists of the most memorable moments from @entity30			1
but the 30th olympiad stands alone in creating a number of significant other world firsts , some that have been shouted from the rooftops as well as others that passed quietly without international fanfare			2
for those , it 's time to get out the bunting , ticker tape , streamers or celebratory toast , wherever you may be			0
here we list the sporting moments you may have missed , and others that athletes may prefer to forget			1
@entity49 may be ahead in the total medal count , but other countries are celebrating taking home just one after years of effort			1
@entity54 went straight to the top of the podium with its first @entity58 courtesy of @entity59 , 19 , who won the men 's 400m , making @entity54 the country with the smallest population to ever win @entity58 gold			1
@entity65 was close to winning gold until @entity66 slipped ahead in the women 's handball final , ensuring the country 's first ever @entity58 medal was silver			1
it was silver too for @entity74 and @entity75 , 21 , in the 20 kilometer race walk , 60 years after the country first debuted at the @entity77			0
@entity78 won its first medal after @entity80 , 18 , who crossed the line in a national record seconds after @entity84 's @entity83 smashed the world record in the men 's 800m			0
on the water , @entity88 , 22 , scored @entity91 ' first medal , again silver , in the men 's laser sailing			0
double - amputee @entity95 made plenty of headlines , but his presence at the @entity77 to compete against able - bodied athletes was a notable first for @entity4			1
@entity95 , 25 , may have gone home without a medal in his 400m events , but he solidified his place as an inspiration to all , especially after accepting defeat with grace			1
" i ca n't describe the feelings i 've had this past week			0
thank you all for playing a part in one of the greatest weeks of my life ! " he tweeted			2
it was a great week too for women 's boxing , which made its debut at the @entity77 , bringing 36 female boxers from 23 nations across three weight divisions to the ring			2
@entity122 erupted when @entity123 , 26 , look home the gold in the women 's light ( 60 kg )			1
" it 's what i 've always dreamed of			0
i 've envisaged this moment so many times before but it 's better than all my wildest dreams to be sitting here as @entity58 champion as well as world and @entity137 champion , " she said			1
at just 17 , @entity139 " @entity141 " @entity138 from the @entity140 won gold in the women 's middle ( 75kg )			2
and @entity145 's @entity144 , 29 , defeated @entity147 's @entity146 , 24 , to take gold in the fly ( 51kg )			0
and it was n't just boxing that turned the spotlight on female athletes			2
@entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 allowed women to compete on their teams for the first time ever , making @entity4 the first @entity30 represented by both women and men from all 205 participating nations			1

crowds cheered as @entity169 , a veiled 19 - year - old from @entity155 , finished last in her 800m run			2
" it was such a huge honor to be asked to come ... i just think it could be something amazing for women in @entity155 , " she said			2
it was n't a record - breaking performance , but 25 - year - old @entity178 's defeat of @entity179 , 31 , in the men 's tennis final was a long - awaited first for the @entity182 who had developed a reputation of " always the bridesmaid , never the bride			1
" spectators on @entity186 went wild as their hero took gold , just one month after losing the @entity190 final to the @entity192 favorite			0
while pundits argued over whether @entity140 swimmer @entity25 ' record - breaking medal haul in the pool made him to be " the greatest olympian ever , " other athletes left the games with less than flattering claims to fame			1
headlines screamed " @entity205 " after @entity202 's @entity201 performed what some called the " worst dive ever			2
" the 22 - year - old scored a zero when his hands slipped from his legs during a forward somersault pike			2
other athletes left @entity4 too with perhaps unwanted attention			2
sixteen - year - old @entity140 gymnast @entity212 inadvertantly launched an internet meme when she appeared cross-armed and scowling while on the podium to receive a silver medal in the women 's vault			1
online tributes to @entity24 's lightning pose spread like wildfire across the internet , but towards the end of the games @entity224 's " @entity223 " was gaining traction after the @entity227 sealed gold in both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters			0
@entity58 stars : what i ca n't live without the " wall of noise " or " wall of sound " made its debut at the @entity30 , a phrase used to describe the deafening cheers of the crowd during the 200 meter stretch of the rowing course at @entity239			1
they may not have set any records -- yet -- but other @entity245 deserve a mention , including @entity247 , the @entity140 4x400m relay runner who inexplicably finished his team 's heat despite running on a broken leg			0
" @entity251 thought that the phrase ' break a leg ' would reach reality for me lol , " he tweeted later			0
one of the most enduring images of the @entity77 could be the distraught face of @entity258 fencer @entity256 as she sat weeping on the piste for more than an hour before officials confirmed that she had lost her match			0
the 25 - year - old had appealed on the basis of a technical fault with the clock			0
@entity256 went on to lose the clash for bronze and later refused an offer of a " special medal			0
" she later came back though to win silver with @entity258 's epee team			0
@entity275 equestrian @entity274 , 71 , may have been the oldest competitor at the @entity30 , but he 'd have to do it again before becoming the oldest olympian ever			1
that title is held by @entity281 shooter @entity279 who contested the @entity282 at the age of 72			0
@entity274 has all but ruled out competing at the 2016 @entity284 in @entity285 , not because he does n't want to but because , at 15 , his horse , @entity287 , is too old			0
one of the final events of @entity30 could be considered its most inspiring yet			1
among the field for the men 's marathon was 28 - year - old " lost boy " @entity293 who fled civil war in @entity295 for a new life in the @entity140 before the race , @entity297 dedicated his run to refugees worldwide			0
officials allowed him to compete as an independent athlete under the @entity58 flag because as a new nation @entity295 does not have an @entity58 committee			1
the event was won by @entity307 of @entity308 in 2:08:01			0
top swim coach : @entity310 ' getting soft ' during the past two weeks , new national heroes emerged			0
@entity310 may have disappointed in the pool , but on water the country 's sailors held their own			0
@entity316 won back - to - back gold medals in the 470 in @entity4 and @entity318 , earning him the honor of carrying the @entity310 flag in the closing ceremony			1
another sailor , @entity322 was chosen to wave the @entity324 for @entity145 after becoming the most successful sailor in @entity58 history			1
@entity30 legacy : trust the @entity145 to get it right and finally , much has been made of the countries at the top of the leader board , but down the other end accomplishments must be noted and commended			1
many countries leave the @entity284 with just one bronze medal			0
step forward @entity335 ( boxing ) , @entity337 ( cycling ) , @entity340 ( hurdles ) , @entity341 ( 1500m ) , @entity155 ( equestrian ) , @entity342 ( taekwondo ) and @entity344 ( shooting ) and a first medal ever for @entity346 , a bronze for @entity348 in the 1500m			0
of course , many countries went home with nothing beyond the experience			2
better luck next time in @entity285			0
opinion : @entity30 have redefined how @entity145 sees itself			2

two weeks of @entity58 sporting *glory* has resulted in some notable firsts
away from the headlines , many countries took home their first ever @entity58 medals
@entity30 was the first games when women were allowed to represent all countries
