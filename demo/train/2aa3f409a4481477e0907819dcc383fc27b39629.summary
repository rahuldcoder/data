-- the dice have been thrown ; over the next couple of months consumers ready to upgrade their phone will be forced into making a decision			1
do they go for a phone that is beautifully designed , will make them feel safe , and never for a moment make them feel out of their comfort zone ? or do they take a risk , a risk that sees them fundamentally change the way they use their phone , the way their phone looks , and even what their phone will be able to do ? decisions will have to be made			2
in the one camp is @entity22 , in the other is @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26			1
the latter three have all announced @entity29 devices that are expected at the end of october or the beginning of november			1
@entity22 's @entity32 went on sale around the world on friday			1
while @entity22 has already confirmed that it has sold 2 million @entity36 , and retailers around the globe detail best ever pre-order records , @entity35 is hoping people will wait			1
it 's a tough ask , do you go with the market leading smartphone now , and get what you expect , or wait for another couple of months and hope it has been worth it			2
those questions aside , @entity35 with the help of @entity24 , @entity26 , and @entity25 , hope you 'll wait			1
if it can convince you to do that , it has a good chance of succeeding			0
the operating system , not yet fully detailed , looks to have some really nice features above and beyond emailing or making calls			0
take the @entity57 that seamlessly manages your contacts and your social life , or the in - built @entity60 that makes writing @entity62 documents or managing spreadsheets really easy			0
there 's a kids corner feature too that locks out important features when you give your phone to your kids so they ca n't email your boss			2
on the hardware front , @entity26 and @entity24 have both gone for a colorful experience			1
@entity29 phones are @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
they are n't just black or white			0
that is likely to appeal to those that want to be noticed , the cool hipsters and fashionastas , that whether you like it or not , influence how you dress			0
@entity26 , to some outcry , has ditched a @entity88 version of its new @entity90 handsets			1
when asked why , it simply replied that @entity88 was n't this year 's color			0
we have n't heard that from a phone company for a long time			2
likewise @entity24 's new @entity96 and @entity97 phones have an equally vibrant color scheme that will either appeal or appall			2
it 's about thinking and being different , almost on purpose			0
get past the colors , the os , and the spec sheet is just as cutting edge , untried and untested			0
most of the new @entity29 8 devices will come with @entity106 , a new technology that will let you pay with your phone or connect instantly to other @entity106 devices			1
@entity22 has shunned the technology in the new @entity32			2
@entity35 is hoping that 's going to be a mistake			0
@entity26 is hoping wireless charging will be a big draw , losing the need for cables all together even in charging and allowing you to just dump your phone on a pillow instead , while @entity24 has teamed up with dr @entity120 's @entity119 to try and win the battle for your ears			1
if it is good enough for @entity125 , it is good enough for us			0
both are pushing the camera at the forefront of the experience			0
the elephant in the room is still apps			0
@entity26 is doing its best to fill the gaps itself , but with momentum still to kick in , @entity22 has the upper hand			1
@entity29 offers a very viable offering for consumers looking for a change , and business users keen to be secure			1
against @entity22 , @entity35 and its new friends have to convince developers to get building , and convince consumers that there is a point to your phone beyond apps			1
with such a competitive market that 's no easy task			0
for @entity35 it has a great os on its side , but the battle is only just starting and they have a long way to go before any of them can claim victory			0
the question is though , are consumers willing to wait with them , or get their gratification before the race has even begun .			2

@entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 have announced @entity29 devices for october or november
@entity22 confirmed that it sold 2 million @entity36 , and retailers detail best ever pre-order records
