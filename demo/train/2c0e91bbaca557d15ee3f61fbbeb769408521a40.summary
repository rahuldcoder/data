@entity0 -- dueling scientists , a former trainer , friends and family are among the witnesses whose testimony a jury will consider as they decide if famed baseball pitcher @entity9 lied to @entity10 during an investigation of steroid use among major league players			1
the case against @entity9 involves one count of obstruction of @entity10 , three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury			1
he is not charged with illicit use of performance - enhancing drugs , but his denial of such use is part of the case against him			0
federal prosecutor @entity29 , in closing arguments tuesday , told the jury @entity9 " wanted to protect his brand , he wanted to protect his livelihood , " in denying the use of steroids during a 2008 investigation by the @entity37 @entity36 into the problem			1
" he did that at the expense of our @entity10			0
he threw sand in their eyes			0
he stole the truth from them , " @entity29 said			0
she said a guilty verdict would give that truth back to lawmakers			0
the @entity9 defense team disputed whether the government has made its case , telling the jury all the evidence came through a former personal trainer , @entity55 , who had incentive to lie			1
" you saw @entity55 , the only witness in the history of the world who says he gave or saw an injection of that man , " said defense attorney @entity57			2
" one person in the entire world			0
" during closing arguments , the defense cited the lack of corroborating witnesses , which they said would be a basis for reasonable doubt against any conviction			1
" @entity55 defines reasonable doubt , " @entity57 said , because of perceived inconsistencies , retractions and corrections he made while testifying			0
after verbally providing instructions to the jury late tuesday , @entity37 district judge @entity75 sent the jury back to begin deliberations , while acknowledging they may only have time to select a foreperson before letting them go for the day			2
the trial has run longer than envisioned , and one juror was moved to alternate status tuesday because of a fellowship in @entity87 for which he must depart next week			2
an alternate was then sent back to join the others			0
it took about eight weeks for the prosecution and defense to question 46 witnesses , and the most direct conflict came among expert witnesses as to how to interpret a collection of discarded medical items that allegedly link @entity9 to steroid use			1
soiled medical wrappings , cotton balls , drug vials and hypodermic needles that @entity55 kept were interpreted differently by both sides			0
witnesses for the government said genetic material linked with @entity9 suggested it was impossible for @entity55 to fabricate the evidence			1
but defense witnesses on the same topic said storage in a beer can for years allowed commingling and contamination of materials , making reliable conclusions impossible , and the evidence nearly worthless			1
" if you have garbage at the start , you 'll have garbage at the end , " said defense expert witness dr. @entity116 , who said his lab would refuse to test such materials without a solid basis for their storage and handling before analysis			1
prosecution witness dr. @entity127 , an @entity128 toxicologist , said it is not up to the toxicology lab to make judgments about the materials submitted for testing , with their job only to determine the substances and any genetic identifiers involved			0
former teammate and friend @entity137 testified as to whether @entity9 had ever accepted injections , providing an eyewitness account that he had			1
" i think it was either 1989 or 1990 , " @entity137 said , referring to their time together with the @entity143 , describing that he " came into the training room , and saw @entity9 bent over the table with his pants down , getting a shot			1
" the vial , @entity137 said , was clearly marked " @entity151 " a substance said to provide a pick - me - up after a game or workout			0
this is the second trial for @entity9			1
a year ago , a mistrial was declared before the case reached the jury			2
the government 's lawyers played video evidence the judge had already banned			2
prosecutors said it was an editing mistake , but the @entity9 defense team suggested prosecutors were unprepared and had gotten off to a bad start			1
" this was a mistake , a regretful mistake , " government attorney @entity168 said in september in arguing for a new trial			2
but @entity75 blasted prosecutors for letting inadmissible evidence be shown			2
" i would hate to believe they just blatantly disregarded rulings that i made , but it 's hard for me to reach any other conclusion , " @entity75 said , before rejecting a defense request that he dismiss the indictment entirely			0
after consideration , @entity75 then ordered the new trial			0
several pretrial hearings this time included protests from defense attorneys that the prosecution was trying to take advantage of having heard the initial opening statement last summer by the defense			0
in the latest trial , defense attorneys expressed concern that prosecutors were trying to " do over " certain efforts the defense may have refuted			1
