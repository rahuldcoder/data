-- in january , i brought my 4 - year - old daughter to @entity3 , the section of @entity6 's @entity5 reserved for egalitarian prayer without gender segregation			1
my husband and i , both conservative rabbis , explained to her that this sacred space once formed part of the ancient @entity14 compound , and we helped her to place a folded - up prayer note in the cracks between the stones			1
it was a sweet moment and one made possible by lengthy negotiations between the @entity22 government and the reform and conservative denominations of @entity25 , as well as the women 's prayer group known as @entity28			1
while the @entity31 authorities who govern the main plaza of the @entity5 mandate gender segregation , the agreement to create an enhanced prayer space at @entity3 allows @entity36 of all denominations to pray at the @entity5 without compromising our egalitarian beliefs			1
but at the end of february , the @entity39 approved an agreement between two government subsidiaries to transfer management of @entity3 to an organization of religious right - wing settlers , @entity46 , posing a new threat to the ability of liberal @entity36 to pray at this site without checking our values at the door			2
today , the @entity6 district court will hear a complaint by the @entity22 attorney general 's office that the @entity56 organized the transfer without authorization			2
@entity59 must join in this opposition			2
@entity46 exists in order to move @entity63 settlers into @entity65 neighborhoods of @entity6 , so as to establish facts on the ground that will obstruct any peace agreement			2
for this , @entity46 raises $ 6 million a year from @entity70			0
this money funds legal maneuvers to evict @entity65 families from their homes and the establishment of jewish settlement compound in @entity65 neighborhoods of @entity6			0
@entity46 also manages the @entity78 archaeological site in @entity6			0
leading @entity22 archaeologists have complained about the use of this site for ideological propaganda tourism			2
there is little question that if @entity46 takes over the archaeological park connected to @entity3 , per the current agreement , our prayer space will similarly be used as a settler propaganda mill. i recently visited @entity92 , the neighborhood that has suffered the most from @entity46 's activities			1
new fortresses , with @entity22 flags flapping over barbed wire barriers , now tower over the humble homes of longtime @entity99 residents			0
armed guards accompany the settlers wherever they go			0
those who argue that @entity36 must be permitted to move into any area of @entity6 must understand : this is not a question of diversifying the neighborhood			0
it 's a hostile takeover			0
it is aimed at ensuring that @entity6 will never become part of a @entity65 state and , in fact , that no such state will ever come to be			0
the @entity114 and @entity115 movements , as well as @entity28 , responded swiftly and furiously to the announcement that @entity46 may take control of @entity3 in a strongly worded joint statement , they argued that an @entity31 organization can not be trusted to maintain the area as a place for egalitarian prayer			0
the very suggestion that an @entity31 group would manage the prayer space reserved for @entity130 prayer reveals how tone - deaf some sectors of the @entity22 government have become to the voices of @entity59 , the vast majority of whom believe that men and women should be equal in prayer as in other parts of life			1
but the danger of transferring power to @entity46 goes far beyond the question of who may pray where			0
this organization seems to have little stake in the debate over egalitarian prayer and in fact has announced its intent to respect existing agreements			0
more concerning is the possibility that those of us committed to egalitarian prayer at the @entity5 will end up supporting the expansion of settlements and the erosion of the peace process through our donations and entrance fees			1
the endless negotiations over religious pluralism in @entity22 have exposed the fissure between @entity59 , who are @entity22 's greatest financial and political supporters , and the @entity22 religious establishment			1
on issues such as the right of women to lead services at the @entity5 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity169 and even @entity31 @entity170 @entity36 have been willing to issue strong statements and even protest at the @entity22 embassy			1
the current crisis over ceding control of an egalitarian prayer space to an organization of right - wing settlers has blown apart the delusion that @entity63 leaders can criticize @entity22 on issues of religious pluralism while staying away from criticisms of settlement policy			1
the two are too deeply intertwined			0
rejecting the @entity31 hegemony that has placed the main plaza of the @entity5 off - limits to egalitarian prayer services also means loosening the grip of settlers on @entity22 politics .			1

prayer space at @entity5 may become politicized , rabbi @entity192 *writes*
she says a portion open to both men and women is being ceded to a settler group
@entity192 says *people* who want to pray together do *n't* want to be endorsing settlers
she says @entity22 authorities , @entity59 should oppose the move
