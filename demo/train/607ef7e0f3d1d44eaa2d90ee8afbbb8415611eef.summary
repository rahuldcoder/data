-- would you rather be sexy or smart ? i hate that dumb question			2
of course you 'd rather be smart			2
although just the other day , @entity4 , a @entity5 engineering graduate and successful entrepreneur , told me , " growing up as a little girl i was always very smart and i got good grades , but i always wanted people to tell me that i was pretty			2
like to me that was the ultimate success			1
it can make you rich			2
it was n't @entity16 's brain that launched the @entity16 empire			1
wait -- i hear you : @entity16 is smart			1
she turned a sex tape into a hit reality tv show			1
she developed a cosmetics line			2
she tried to break the @entity23			2
but it 's not like @entity16 goes around urging little girls to use their brains			1
she is sending them a decidedly different kind of message			2
so , again , how would you answer -- sexy or smart ? @entity31 , who was one of the first women to earn a bachelor 's degree in physics from @entity35 , is writing a book called " the only woman in the room : why @entity39			1
" it aims to expose factors that impact women 's access to careers in science , technology , engineering and math -- the fields known collectively as @entity50			1
she had this to say : " first of all , that the question would even be asked -- i can see all the anxiety that it poses			0
why is that even a question ? why is n't it assumed that they can be both ? this is n't a critique of your question , because that question is the story of my life			0
" i can understand that			0
@entity31 , as a @entity35 physics pioneer , is n't speaking to us from the grave , but from the heart			0
why is it , she wonders , when girls reach the age of 6 , brains take a back seat to beauty even if they have both ? " if it 's your professor or employer , i guess you want to be smart , " @entity31 said			1
" but not if there is a guy in the room			0
in @entity88 , nobody 's boyfriend wants them to be smarter than he is , and no one wants to admit it			1
if @entity16 really is smart , then why is her husband , music mogul @entity93 , now supposedly controlling her empire ? even if that 's not true , the narrative exists and it says something about how girls may , in their heart of hearts , answer that question			1
@entity103 and i talked about how to persuade more girls to skip the @entity106 and revel in their natural curiosity			1
it 's why @entity103 created her toy company , @entity109			1
" growing up as a little girl , i certainly had no interest in becoming a scientist or mathematician or engineer , " @entity103 said			0
" i thought it was a boys - only club for geniuses			1
and i pictured this old white man in a lab coat with no friends			0
" @entity122 , the doll who rules the @entity109 world , is n't beautiful like princess @entity126 , not sexy like @entity127 , but brainy , curious and quirky , like @entity103 herself			0
and when i say quirky , i do n't mean like the brainy women on " @entity130			1
" i do n't think many little girls clamor to be like @entity132 or @entity133			1
@entity134 wins the day on that show			1
@entity136 , a community college dropout , is incurious and kinda , well , dippy			0
and she continually wins the sexy , brilliant male nerd : @entity139			0
poor @entity133 is stuck with @entity140 , a man @entity136 once described as " disgusting			0
" and amy ? well ... i bring up " @entity130 " and lump it in with @entity16 because both send a strong message to impressionable girls -- and to the rest of us			1
i 'm not saying they are solely to blame for the @entity149 site that instructs girls to be smart without being nerdy , but something in our culture is causing girls to tune out math and science			1
in many countries , girls now outperform boys in science , but not in the @entity88 , according to a study by the @entity161 , reported by @entity162			1
@entity103 says that means " it 's a cultural issue in the @entity88 rather than a gender one			1
" just look at @entity166			0
she is a physicist from @entity167 , @entity168			0
@entity166 was just elected to lead the most prestigious particle physics research center in the world , @entity171			0
or , as @entity174 describes it , a " $ 9 billion cathedral of science " that could unlock the secrets of the universe			1
" i grew up in environment that had more women in science , " @entity166 told me			1
when i asked her the sexy - smart question she sounded puzzled			0
" i hope women and men in general value their brain			0
the brain is much more useful in life than beauty			1
" interestingly , @entity166 sees physics in a decidedly feminine way			0
" i like the beauty of physics , " she told me			1
" nature is beautiful , it is my second soul to music			0
" when i asked her who inspired her , @entity166 did not hesitate			0
@entity197 , the @entity198 - winning physicist who researched radioactivity is her idol			0
" she ( @entity197 ) had a domestic way of doing physics , " @entity166 told me			0
" she had a lab in her house			0
she could prepare dinner in her kitchen , then move into her lab. she could have a normal life			0
" note @entity166 said " a normal life			0
" that 's important because @entity88 girls like normal			1
@entity31 points to a 2010 @entity213 study that determined why so few women in the @entity88 became physicists , mathematicians or computer scientists to prove the point			0
one reason -- and i stress only one -- is that girls are not attracted to the " asocial " geek image associated with the sciences			1
they find the culture " unsatisfying			2
" " parents do n't want their kids to be nerdy , " @entity31 told me			0
" for women , even if she 's nerdy enough to be @entity229 , she 's undateable			2
" see -- it all comes back to that not - so - easy question			2
" there 's still this americanized version of being too smart in anything , " @entity31 continued			2
" you have to look like a porn star in eighth grade			0
there 's this huge obsession with romance , being a princess , a supermom			2
" maybe @entity103 's little @entity122 doll , who actively maligns @entity88 's cultural definition of beauty in online videos , can help			1
in " @entity122 vs. the @entity250 , " a woman states : " you are beauty and beauty is perfection			2
" @entity254 dressed little girls walk the " runway " as another little girl , in sneakers , blows that myth out of the water			2
as @entity103 puts it , " i was hoping that if girls looked at @entity122 and they wanted to be like her and do what she does , they might value their brains as much as their beauty			1
" so , sexy or smart ? come on , ask your daughter which is more important			0
then ask her why .			0

@entity271 : when girls reach age of 6 , why do brains take a back seat to beauty ?
@entity271 : " @entity130 " and @entity16 send messages to girls about success
studies show across *65* countries girls outperformed boys in @entity50 fields
@entity271 : maybe it 's our culture that 's making girls turn away from math and science
