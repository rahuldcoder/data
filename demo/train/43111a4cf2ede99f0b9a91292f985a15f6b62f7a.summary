-- @entity2 's roller coaster few weeks regarding same - sex marriage has taken yet another sharp turn , with the state tax board announcing that legally married gay and lesbian couples -- even those wed in the brief period of limbo in @entity2 -- can file joint returns			1
the @entity12 detailed the apparent policy change posted on its website , explaining that same - sex couples who are eligible to file a joint federal income tax return can likewise file joint returns in @entity2			1
in other words , the state -- for tax purposes -- will treat them just like heterosexual couples			0
the state agency , in an official notice dated wednesday , said this decision is n't necessarily permanent : if federal courts side with @entity2 officials arguing that the state law limiting marriage to one man and one woman be upheld , then same - sex couples will not be able to file joint state tax returns next year in @entity2			1
" this notice is limited to the 2013 tax year , " the commission said			0
" filing information for future years will be provided as court rulings and other information becomes available			0
" @entity38 , a spokesman for the state tax agency , said the decision put @entity2 's tax outlook on same - sex couples on par with that of the federal government , which has said it will recognize such legal unions			1
it does not , however , mean that the @entity2 government -- as a broader entity -- is right now recognizing same - sex marriage			1
" this is just one agency , one decision , " @entity38 said			0
whatever the rationale , this shift marks a significant milestone for @entity57 supporters in the traditionally conservative state			0
it comes after @entity61 district judge @entity60 ruled on december 20 that @entity2 's law prohibiting same - sex marriage -- which voters approved in 2004 -- conflicted with the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process			1
afterward , many couples in the state sought and got marriage licenses			0
officials said more than 1,000 such licenses were issued in a 17 - day period , though it 's not clear if all those people actually wed. @entity60 's ruling ignites same - sex marriage frenzy the 10th @entity78 declined to immediately stay the lower court ruling , leading @entity2 officials to ask the @entity81 to intervene			1
the high court did just that in a two - sentence order on january 6 that , without comment , put same - sex marriages on hold in @entity2 until the constitutional questions are fully resolved			1
that apparently unanimous order in favor of the state sends the matter back to an appeals court for expedited consideration			0
the @entity95 - based appeals court is expected to consider the case again in coming weeks more thoroughly , with a ruling possibly affecting all states in its jurisdiction : @entity2 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			2
that last state , @entity104 , is in a similar situation after a federal judge struck down its same - sex marriage ban			1
but he immediately stayed his own ruling , as the matter works its way through the courts			0
judge : @entity104 gay marriage ban unconstitutional still , what 's happening in @entity2 was and remains less clear - cut			1
while the federal government has said it will recognize same - sex marriages performed between late december and early january in the state , the state had hinted that it would not			2
this indication came in a january 8 letter from the office of @entity2 gov. @entity123 to cabinet officials saying that , based on advice from the state 's attorney general , " state recognition of same - sex marital status is on hold until further notice			1
" " please understand this position is not intended to comment on the legal status of those same - sex marriages -- that is for the courts to decide , " wrote the governor 's chief of staff , @entity132			2
" the intent of this communication is to direct state agency compliance with current laws that prohibit the state from recognizing same - sex marriages			2
" this week 's tax commission announcement , though , does signal at least parts of the state government are recognizing such unions			1
it applies not just to the hundreds married in @entity2 , but also to those gay and lesbian couples who might have gotten legally married in other states then moved to @entity2			2
@entity38 , the state tax commission spokesman , explained that authorities -- including his group 's director and the attorney general -- decided over the past 10 days that it made sense to have @entity2 play by the same rules , tax-wise , as the @entity61 government until the legal situation plays itself out			1
" we feel this brings us in line with the current judicial situation , " @entity38 said			0
this shift may surprise some given @entity2 's reputation politically			2
it 's the home of the @entity169 , often referred to as @entity170 , whose leaders have been vocal in efforts to limit marriage to a man and woman			0
its voters have voted for the @entity179 presidential candidate in every election since 1968			0
and its officials now have stood behind the legal efforts to defend their state 's existing law			0
but there are also some signs that the situation in the state on this issue may not be crystal clear			0
a recent poll commissioned by the @entity192 , one of the state 's biggest newspapers , found an even split -- 48 % for and 48 % against -- of people asked if same - sex couples should be allowed to get state - issued marriage licenses			1
it 's margin of error is + / - 4.1 %			0
in the same survey , 72 % of respondents said same - sex couples should at least be allowed to have civil unions or domestic partnerships			2
@entity0 's @entity207 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's tax commission says that same - sex couples can file joint returns for 2013
the shift affects those married in other states , plus about 1,000 married in @entity2
those marriages came after a federal judge struck the state 's same - sex marriage ban
the @entity81 stayed the ruling ; state officials have been fighting to keep the ban
