-- history 's best bathing suits are n't always practical -- @entity5 's @entity4 two - piece from one million years @entity6 would n't have lasted long in open water -- but they 're impossible to forget			1
@entity10 fashion director @entity9 shares the top ten on - screen swimsuits that are forever in our memories			2
@entity15 in " @entity16 " ( 1962 ) as @entity17 , she stepped out of the @entity18 and into the fantasies of every guy longing to be @entity21			2
the matching knife belt was a cute touch			0
@entity25 in " @entity26 " ( 1982 ) backed by a curtain of sprinkler - coated sunbeams , @entity25 's high school princess joined the pool party in a skimpy bikini as red as her lipstick			1
a besotted judge @entity32 -- and a generation of teenage boys in the movie theater -- envisioned unhooking her top			0

@entity40 in " 10 " ( 1979 ) her perfect score has never been beaten			1
but then , how many women fill out a nude maillot like second skin and get spotted running down a beach in slow motion ? @entity40 may have been the best thing to happen to sales of the one - piece			1
@entity54 in " @entity51 " ( 1959 ) in @entity52 brilliantly macabre classic , @entity50 's cousin deliberately dressed her in a plunging , stark white maillot so that every man on the beach would come a little bit closer for a better look at her , and then he could get a better look at them			2
considering the attraction was @entity54 , everyone wound up with a lot to look at			0
the @entity69 poster ( 1976 ) to promote her instant celebrity in " @entity71 , " a @entity67 poster company arranged to shoot @entity72 in a bikini at her house			2
but the actress was n't comfortable so exposed			0
so she pulled this red one - piece from her closet			1
the company hated the pic , but @entity80 had final approval ( and retained photo rights )			0
smart girl : the poster sold over 12 million copies and is still for sale today			0
10 slimming swimsuits for curvy women 6			0
@entity90 in " @entity91 " ( 2005 ) nobody remembers the film : it had something to do with sunken treasure , drugs , bad guys , six - pack abs , and a water park called " @entity100			1
" but plenty of people took notice of @entity105 's role as theme - park guide and her unmatched swimsuit : no doubt bikini separates gained in popularity after this promo shot was released			1
@entity113 in " @entity114 " ( 1992 ) " the world 's most popular series " is gone , but you can still buy a copy of the suit with the sky - high - cut thigh online			1
however , good luck looking as good in it as @entity125 's @entity124			2
funny , @entity125 was n't in the original cast			0
but who can imagine " @entity129 " without her ? 8			0
@entity131 in " @entity132 " ( 1983 ) today , it may be hard to reconcile the acid tongue and ruthless honesty of this writer , performer and popular @entity138 script doctor with her former role as @entity141 's most famous princess			1
but at the height of " @entity132 's " climax , @entity142 rescued @entity145 from the swirling gold and chain link bondage gear of @entity149 -- and her sexy suit remains one of the most memorable in the galaxy			1
@entity5 in " @entity154 " ( 1966 ) ok , so maybe the dates are n't quite accurate			1
in fact , if most women in prehistoric times really looked and dressed like this , a lot more people today would be studying cave paintings			0
as fabulous as it is ludicrous , @entity5 's animal - skin bikini may be film 's most famous bathing suit that never got wet			1
flattering one - piece swimsuits 10			1
@entity169 in " @entity168 " ( 2002 ) best way to revive a fading franchise ? go back to square one			0
in " @entity168 , " another breathtaking beauty ( this time an oscar - winner ) made an entrance straight from the ocean			2
an inspired homage to @entity15 's original @entity21 girl , @entity179 's fire - orange - clad @entity177 killed -- both literally and figuratively			2
