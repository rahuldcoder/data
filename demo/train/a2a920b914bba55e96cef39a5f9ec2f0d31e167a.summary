-- without talisman @entity2 , @entity1 slipped to their second defeat in a week as a 1 - 0 reverse at @entity5 sunday blew the @entity7 title race wide open			1
already qualified for the @entity9 knockout stages , their 2 - 1 midweek loss to @entity11 could be forgiven , but @entity13 's 70th minute winner for @entity5 has far greater significance			1
it was @entity1 's first league reverse of the season and left them level on points with @entity21 with arch - rivals @entity22 snapping at their heels a further three points adrift			1
athletic , who are unbeaten at their new @entity28 stadium , have moved up into the fourth @entity9 spot with the victory			2
@entity13 might have put them ahead in the first half but he wasted a great chance from close range , while @entity1 offered little in reply			1
@entity37 's @entity36 was kept quiet but just after half time he burst through only to be pulled back by home midfielder @entity38 , who was lucky to escape with a yellow card			0
but the men from the @entity42 country remained a constant threat and @entity44 crossed for @entity13 to slide home his decisive goal			2
a second should have followed but @entity48 headed a cross straight at @entity1 goalkeeper @entity50 , who made a reaction save			0
@entity1 coach @entity52 flung on @entity53 and @entity54 as late substitutes , but to no avail			0
@entity2 was confined to the sidelines for the second time this season last month with a hamstring injury which is set to keep him out of action until january , missing at least two more @entity62 games			0
meanwhile in @entity64 , champions @entity63 went three points clear of early pace setters @entity67 with a 1 - 0 win over @entity69 sunday			1
it took an injury - time header from @entity73 striker @entity72 to grab the three vital points as he headed @entity76 's shot past @entity77			0
@entity63 had plenty of chances to wrap up their 12th win of the season and sixth in a row , but were frustrated by dogged defense and poor finishing until the last gasp strike			1
earlier , @entity67 were held to their fourth draw in a row , 1 - 1 away at @entity88			2
@entity89 , who are in third , nine points adrift , travel to @entity91 monday			0
fourth placed @entity92 failed to make up ground as they were held 1 - 1 at home to @entity95			2
@entity96 scored a late leveler for @entity95 after @entity98 had given @entity92 an 18th minute lead at the @entity100 .			0

@entity1 lose first @entity62 game of the season
beaten 1 - 0 by @entity5 at @entity28
goal by @entity13 in second half gives @entity5 *famous* victory
