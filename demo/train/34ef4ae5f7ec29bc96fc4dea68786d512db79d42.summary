-- @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 is traveling to @entity5 on monday as part of the latest effort to forge a peace deal between @entity5 and the @entity9 , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity1 said			1
@entity3 is flying from @entity11 -- where he had discussed the @entity13 crisis with @entity15 foreign minister @entity14 over the weekend -- into @entity16 , with possible meetings in @entity18 and @entity19 over the next day , a senior @entity2 official said			2
@entity3 tried to restart the @entity5 - @entity9 peace process eight months ago , aiming to get a deal leading to the two states coexisting peacefully			1
so far , the process has included a series of meetings along with incremental steps intended to build trust , such as prisoner releases			0
however , @entity3 's initial goal of an agreement by the end of april has morphed into a possible framework for further talks through the end of 2014			0
@entity1 said @entity3 decided it would be productive to return to the region this week after consulting with a @entity4 team that is negotiating with the @entity5 and the @entity9 to end their decades - long conflict			1
" over the course of the last eight months , the @entity5 and @entity9 have both made tough choices , and as we work with them to determine the next steps , it is important they remember that only peace will bring the @entity5 and @entity9 people both the security and economic prosperity they all deserve , " @entity1 said			2
@entity3 's trip comes after president @entity49 hosted @entity5 prime minister @entity50 and @entity52 president @entity51 for separate @entity54 talks earlier this month			0
while both sides have signaled agreement with the concept of a two - state solution , in which @entity5 and an independent @entity9 nation would live @entity61 , they remain at odds over how to make that happen			0
