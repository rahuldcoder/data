" the @entity24 will launch an internal review of security protocols at its facilities , its administrator said monday			1
" if we need to make changes as a result of what happened on friday to improve the system , we will not hesitate to do so , " @entity91 said			0
" we need to be looking at everything ... from the people that we employ through our contractors , all the way through all the processes that we use -- how they have access to our facilities and what kind of monitoring takes place within those facilities			0
that 's all on the table , " he said			0
@entity91 told @entity72 that background checks on @entity35 had not identified any potential problems , and so he wants investigators to look into that vetting process too			0
" are there things that we need to do differently ? immediately , it 's more eyes , more resources , and more frequent check - ins with facilities , but over the long term , if there are things that we identify that we should change , we 're certainly going to change them , " the administrator said			2
