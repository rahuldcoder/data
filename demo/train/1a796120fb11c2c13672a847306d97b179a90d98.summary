along the @entity1 in @entity2 , people waited in a line that would challenge any fancy art gallery opening or exclusive @entity6 club			1
but what brought these people here on a cool sunny thursday afternoon was n't art or exclusivity , it was cats			0
well , cats and coffee			2
@entity15 opened its doors thursday , for cat lovers and the cat - curious to enjoy complimentary " cat'achino " cappuccinos , talk cat health and learn about cat adoption with 16 cuddly cats			1
pet food brand @entity23 is hosting the café as a pop - up shop , lasting only through sunday , but organizers hope the event encourages cat health awareness and adoption			1
" the goal of what we 're doing here is try to start a conversation about cat health			1
what better place to do that then over a cup of coffee with some friends in a café ? we thought if people are going to be talking about cat health , you should be among your subjects and have cats all around you , " said @entity42 with @entity23			1
" it 's a great thing because dogs are very publicly social -- you can take your dog out and go for a walk , talk to people at the dog park -- but that 's not a luxury most cat owners have , so this is a place you can talk with likeminded people about cat health and be among cats			1
" as cat people sipped cappuccinos with cat faces drawn in the foam and flicked furry , feathered balls attached to sticks by string at feline guests , @entity42 said the café featured a " @entity73 " speaker series with discussions led by a cat behaviorist , a veterinarian and other cat experts			2
nearby , @entity79 the cat had been camped out on @entity80 for about an hour , when someone came over to say @entity79 had been adopted			0
" i 'm so excited for her , because she is seriously the most precious thing , and somebody is going to be very happy , " an only slightly sad looking @entity80 said			0
@entity23 partnered with @entity85 , a large , no - kill animal rescue and adoption organization based in @entity88 , @entity6 , to bring 16 specially chosen cats from around the country to hang out at the café			1
" so far i think we 've had about four cats adopted , but on saturday we 're having an event here where we 'll have our mobile unit that will have additional cats available for adoption , and we 're always encouraging people to come over to the shelter in @entity88 where we have over a hundred adoptable cats , " said @entity92 , shelter director for @entity85			2
cat coffee houses started in @entity104 , have gained popularity in @entity106 , and there are talks of opening a few in such places as @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			1
@entity115 for now , organizers say the @entity15 in @entity6 is the first feline coffee spot in @entity116			1
" i just want to look at cats			0
i go to school here , so i 'm far from my cats			0
i just wanted to get my fill , " said @entity121 , who waited nearly two hours to get in the café , " you hear about them in @entity125 , and i always thought i would have to go to @entity125 to go to a cat café			0
for those who were n't in @entity6 or could n't handle the line , scenes from inside the cat café were livestreamed with more than 5,000 people watching around the world			0
the hashtag # @entity134 was used to spark conversations about the event and cat health on social media			1
by mid-day there had been more than 3,000 mentions of @entity15 on @entity142 , about 74 per hour , and 178 " news mentions " of @entity15			2
at least 30 videos had been posted with @entity15 in the title			2
for others , social media merely spread the word and would never make up for seeing the felines up close			0
" i 'm just really excited about the cat café -- hopefully i 'll be able to pet some cats ! " said @entity150 , who had been standing in line for a half hour and still had n't made it around the block			0
@entity159 was waiting in line next to her and said , " i heard it on @entity163 , i told her , she loves cats , so now we 're here			0

the @entity15 in @entity2 is a pop - up shop that 's a first in @entity116
feline lovers gathered to talk cat health over coffee , play with cats up for adoption
cat cafes started in @entity104 and are spreading to @entity106
