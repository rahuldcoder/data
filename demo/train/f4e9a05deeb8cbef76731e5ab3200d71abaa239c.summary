-- @entity3 's international image may be taking hits because of the violence produced by drug cartels , but it has n't hurt its tourism industry , officials say			1
international tourism to @entity3 has increased 2.1 % in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010 , and it remains the top destination for @entity10 traveling abroad			1
statistics from the @entity10 @entity12 show that fewer americans are traveling abroad , but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to @entity3			1
@entity3 also reported double - digit increases in the percentage of visitors from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , among others			1
" the data does n't lie , " @entity3 's deputy secretary for tourism , @entity24 , told @entity0			1
" tourists keep choosing @entity3			1
" the unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off @entity3 as a dangerous destination			1
the truth , @entity34 said , is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists			2
the border area , for example , where much violence has been recorded , is 1,200 miles from the resort town of @entity45 -- that 's like avoiding travel to @entity48 because of problems in @entity50 , he said			0
according to surveys by @entity3 tourism authorities , 98 % of those who do visit @entity3 say they will come back , and 99 % recommend it to others			1
opinion : why you should go to @entity3 much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies , such as the so - called @entity64 countries -- @entity19 , @entity18 , @entity65 and @entity20			1
for starters , @entity3 began allowing holders of @entity10 visas to enter @entity3 , opening up the possibility of tourists to the @entity10 extending their trips south of the border			1
also , @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity74 visitors can gain travel permission to @entity3 on the @entity76 , with no need for a visa			1
finally , for travelers from other countries , visas to @entity3 in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent , erasing the need for trips to embassies			2
in 2011 to date , @entity3 has seen a 40.9 % increase in @entity19 tourists , a 58.1 % increase from @entity18 and 32.8 % increase from @entity20 , according to @entity3 's tourism ministry			1
for @entity10 travelers specifically , the @entity12 's most recent data -- for 2009 -- shows that 31.7 % of all @entity10 international tourists go to @entity3			1
from 2002 to 2009 , while @entity10 tourism to @entity96 fell by more than 27 % , tourism to @entity3 from the @entity10 increased by 5.1 %			1
this happened even though the overall number of @entity10 traveling abroad decreased , from a peak of 64 million in 2007 to 61.4 million in 2009			1
when @entity102 , a high school teacher in @entity103 , told her friends that she and her husband 's family were going to @entity107 for a yearly retreat , she was met with skepticism			0
are you worried , they would ask ? are you still going ? " i think people see all of @entity3 as one entity , " she told @entity0			2
it was the third straight year that she traveled to the same resort , and security was not a concern for her			0
@entity120 is pregnant , and she was more worried about food - borne or water - borne illness			0
she was aware of several @entity123 travel warnings to @entity3 's cartel hot spots , but she also knew that the area she was traveling to was not affected			2
her group planned to stay on the resort , where they felt safest , but on the advice of resort staff they trusted from the previous trips , they ventured into the city without worries			0
" unfortunately , there are the headline - grabbing things -- the drugs , the violence -- but i do n't think that 's indicative of what 's happening in the entire country , " @entity120 said			0
@entity34 pointed out that @entity10 are not unaware of the violence -- 80 % of @entity10 who travel to @entity3 go to six places , none of which have had travel alerts			1
the destinations are @entity107 , @entity151 , @entity45 , @entity153 / @entity152 , @entity154 and @entity155 , he said			0
some beach destinations , like @entity157 , have been the scene of some of the drug cartel bloodshed , but still managed to increase its tourism 3 % in the first five months of 2011 compared to last year , thanks to national , rather than international , tourism			0
but some pitfalls of tourism in @entity3 persist			2
@entity167 , @entity168 , resident @entity169 and a couple of friends made the six - hour trek last week from her home to @entity174 in the state of @entity176 , @entity3			2
this area is not under a travel warning , but is not among the top destinations for @entity10 tourists			2
" i was scared out of my mind to go there , " @entity169 said			0
friends of hers who are in the military are not allowed to cross the border and urged her not to do the same			0
but she wanted to go to the beach to write for a book she is working on , and @entity174 is the closest one			0
on the first day of her vacation , her group was pulled over by a police officer , who promptly asked for $ 100 in exchange to letting them go			0
in the moment she was frightened , all those stories about bloody ends in @entity3 rushing to her mind			2
but she negotiated the bribe down to $ 20 and her group was allowed to continue on their journey			0
" it was pretty pathetic , i thought			0
what are you going to do with 20 bucks ? " she said			0
still , she was unable to relax during her vacation			0
would she go back ? she does n't know			0
would she recommend @entity3 to a friend ? maybe , but only if you are traveling with someone who could act as a guide .			2

@entity3 remains the *no.* 1 destination for @entity10 traveling abroad
tourism officials have worked to *diversify* their tourism base
initiatives have brought more tourists from @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity20
some tourists have good experiences , some bad
