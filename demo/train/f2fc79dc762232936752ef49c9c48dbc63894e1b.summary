-- @entity1 is selling @entity1			0
the former vice presidential candidate and half - term governor of @entity4 is a commodity of one and a marketing machine			1
she has created a new politics of profit			0
@entity10 's reanimation on the @entity12 stage probably means no more than the other intentions she has floated but never executed			1
she spent almost a year of the last presidential election cycle teasing the far right that she was going to run for president			0
she never did , but lots of network tv interviews and speculative articles drove up her name recognition and brand identification			1
and she 's not running again			2
@entity10 is re-running the same show in her home state of @entity4 by hinting that she is going to be a candidate for the @entity25			1
she will not run though			0
there is too much risk of failure			0
she 's not the near - unknown who was elected governor of @entity4 and then quit 2Â½ years into the job			2
she has a profile , and she intends to use it to make money , which is one commitment she knows how to keep			2
running and losing is always bad for business			0
politically , @entity10 is an opposite gender version of @entity40			2
she makes grandiloquent statements about candidacies and a future that she knows will never transpire			0
@entity40 and @entity10 lack the courage to run for president but have profitably monetized the speculation about a candidacy			2
@entity40 can not abide the notion of losing , which he knows is inevitable , and he fears what that might do to his image and revenue stream			0
@entity10 is self - aware enough to realize that she has neither the intellect nor popular support outside the increasingly unpopular tea party			1
so why not make a buck ? in the detritus of the @entity61 presidential campaign , the second name emerged as the lead act			0
the first nine months after her resignation as governor , at the end of july 2009 , @entity10 reportedly earned $ 12 million , including a book deal , a tv show and speaking fees that were generally more than $ 100,000 per appearance			1
it 's not hard to tell whether principle is more important than profit for the failed vice presidential candidate			2
the tea party has been charged $ 100,000 for a @entity10 speech , and , even as she promotes support of charities , a @entity75 cancer center a few years ago paid $ 200,000 for her to attend a fund - raiser , and the event sold out at $ 200 a seat			1
her politics and intelligence might be trifling , but @entity10 appears to have evolved a very nice business model : raise the profile to raise the revenue , mostly for herself			1
and she 's back at it			0
until recently , @entity10 has n't been too active , except on social media			2
she seems to have the entire national tea party population on her @entity94 page , but the tv cameras had not been showing up when she gave her bargain - priced speeches			1
a love spat with @entity98 that kept her off the air and then back into the network 's arms has left her fans confused			0
donations to @entity104 fell off			0
why was no one paying attention ? @entity107 should not fear			0
she has seen opportunity in the tea party and its plans to beat moderate @entity112 in @entity112 primaries			1
this is a nearly risk - free approach to increased @entity1 - wareness			0
the candidate runs , @entity10 speaks and rallies the initiates			1
she endorses , and if the campaign fails it is the candidate 's fault , not @entity10 's ; she 's moved on to help in another race			1
but the cameras came , reporters took notes , images were broadcast , words were published , and @entity10 's price went up			1
timing is critical to maximizing opportunity , of course			0
when the federal government shut down as a consequence of tea party obstinacy , @entity10 jetted off to @entity135 to help her ideological consort , sen. @entity137 of @entity138 , as they crashed the " @entity140 " at the @entity139			1
those cameras and bullhorns and journalists were there			0
@entity10 had just arrived from @entity145 , where she had endorsed the hopeless tea party candidacy of @entity148 , who lost , soundly , but not without @entity1 getting tv time in @entity150			1
in business school , they teach " know your customer			0
" @entity10 might have attended that class because she is promising to help @entity12 candidates unseat @entity112 @entity158 senators in @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 in 2014			1
the @entity1 tour begins , however , several months ahead at the @entity165 and @entity166 dinner on november 9			0
in what is almost certainly a coincidence of timing , just three days later , @entity10 's new book goes on sale for the holidays			1
she has not written about the @entity173 or her understanding of @entity175 in the @entity176 ; @entity10 , instead , is doing the much more challenging work of preventing further harm to @entity179			1
" @entity180 and @entity181 : protecting the @entity182 , " can already be pre-ordered			0
or just send a check to @entity10			2
she might not understand politics or policy , but @entity10 knows money			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity192 : @entity10 's revival on the @entity12 stage increases her brand recognition
@entity190 : she 's a marketing machine , taking every opportunity to raise her profile
@entity190 : @entity10 promotes tea party candidates in safe *districts* , never runs for office
he says her *re-emergence* comes just before release of her book defending @entity179
