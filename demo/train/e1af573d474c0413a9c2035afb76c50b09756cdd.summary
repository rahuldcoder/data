-- photographer @entity1 is a man without fear			1
he swims among sharks without the protection of a cage to make studio - quality , intimate photos of these beautiful creatures			1
as scary as that might sound , the top predators are at the bottom of his list of concerns			2
he 's usually far more concerned about all the gear he brings into the water			2
" the sharks do n't really pose any of the danger			2
it 's all the diving , and the technical [ challenges ] and electricity and the light , " @entity1 says			1
" i do n't use cages -- i 've been surrounded by 150 to 200 sharks , not once ever been close to being bitten			1
" using studio techniques in the wild has helped @entity1 's work stand out in a crowded field of nature photographers			1
it bolsters the attention he 's received as a commercial photographer , a spotlight he 's leveraging to raise awareness about critically diminishing global shark populations			1
this week his shark photos are being featured on the @entity37 blog as he takes over @entity39 's account for @entity40			1
he 'll be uploading images from his own feed as well as posting new pictures from @entity44 , where he 's currently swimming with whale sharks			1
both venues are helping broadcast his pictures -- and his message -- to an enormous audience			0
because of threats like overfishing and a high demand for fins , " the sharks are really in a lot of danger right now , " he says			0
" we 're killing about 100 million of them a year			0
people have no idea when they hear the numbers , and they 're the top of a very , very fragile ecosystem in the oceans , so if you take out the top predator it 's just like a domino effect			0
" " @entity82 " as he 's sometimes called , says his highly successful commercial work has helped him see the power of photography , but rather than promote celebrities or products , he 's using his skills to help advocacy organizations like @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 in @entity81			0
" i thought ok , i 've done $ 10 billion in movie posters , maybe i can help sort of change people 's perceptions of these animals and what 's happening to our planet , " he says			0
as any professional photographer must be these days , @entity1 is also something of an entrepreneur			1
in addition to owning the patent on the seven - bulb , 1200 - watt lighting rig he uses to illuminate the sharks , he 's developed a photo toning app and is busy helping establish an online photography school			2
he says he 's also got a number of books in the works , based on his photos of sharks			0
photographers strive to make images that connect with viewers , and the skills needed to do that are universal , whether under water or on land			2
a sense for composition , timing , and more than anything , patience will produce powerful images of a shark as surely as anything else			1
@entity1 hopes the connections his images forge will motivate people to think beyond their preconceptions about sharks			1
ultimately , the global conversation will have to shift so people do n't see these animals simply as a source of fins , or animals to be hunted for sport , but instead as the magnificent mainstays of a vast and delicate ecosystem that they really are			0
" in order to get those changes you need people from within those cultures to come out and take a stand , which they 're starting to do , " he says			0
" our generation i do n't really have a lot of hope for , " he says			0
" it 's for the next generation [ that needs to ] fix what we 've done and what we 're leaving them			0
