@entity0 -- a @entity4 girl who survived the execution - style killing of her father , mother and grandmother in a normally idyllic region of the @entity10 last week returned to @entity4 on friday , authorities said			1
@entity13 , 7 , left @entity14 in the morning and arrived in the @entity4 , @entity12 police said			1
as the only survivor , she could be a key witness who saw who carried out the shooting , according to the @entity14 prosecutor leading the investigation			1
she spent several days in a medically induced coma , and as of wednesday , she remained too badly injured to be questioned , @entity20 said			0
she was beaten and shot in the attack , and rescued by a @entity4 cyclist who came upon the scene on september 5			1
the cyclist , former @entity26 pilot @entity25 , helped the injured girl and called for help			1
in an interview with @entity30 , he recounted the shocking scene he stumbled across as he went on a regular bike ride in a national park			2
@entity25 said what he found in the parking lot -- three people shot dead in a car and a fourth on the ground nearby -- was like " a @entity40 scene			1
" his account came as @entity14 prosecutor @entity20 and investigating judge @entity42 were in @entity4 seeking new leads in the case			1
they met with @entity46 , whose officers have been helping @entity14 investigators to search the home of two of the victims , @entity50 and @entity52 , in @entity54 town , @entity12 county			2
bomb squad clears suspicious items in victims ' home @entity20 said it was " highly likely that the reasons and causes for ( the crime ) have their origin in this country			0
" " our presence here does not mean that there are problems between the two jurisdictions , " @entity20 said			0
" we wish to reinforce our cooperation and understanding with hope to reach a conclusion to these horrible murders			0
" @entity46 will do all they can to assist the @entity14 - led investigation , said @entity78 , the assistant chief constable			1
@entity20 said wednesday that investigators were focused on three main areas : @entity82 's job , his links to his native @entity84 and a reported family dispute over money involving his brother			2
born in @entity88 in 1962 , @entity82 was a naturalized @entity4 citizen who had lived in the @entity4 for decades			1
he was an engineer working at @entity90 , a high - tech company owned by @entity91 , an aerospace corporation that builds satellites			2
authorities have been tight - lipped about possible perpetrators and motives in the attack , although speculation has been rife in the @entity4 media			1
@entity25 's account to the @entity30 shed fresh light on the grisly scene that confronted @entity14 police near @entity103 after the alarm was raised last wednesday			1
' @entity105 at @entity106 ' : more questions than answers the first thing he saw as he cycled up the mountain road near the village of @entity106 was the bike of a @entity14 cyclist on the ground , @entity25 said			1
then he spotted the wounded girl , whose parents and grandmother were subsequently identified as those shot to death in the car			2
she was stumbling and falling over , and at first he thought she was playing , @entity25 told the @entity30			0
then he realized she was injured and put her in a recovery position as she slipped in and out of consciousness			0
the car engine was still revving and wheels spinning , he said , making him fear it could move and harm the girl and the cyclist whose bike he had seen on the ground			2
" at first i thought , there 's been a terrible accident between a cyclist and a car , because there was a cyclist on the ground more or less in front of the car			2
but there were things that did n't quite match , because the cyclist 's bike was n't beside him , so as the minutes went on , i started to change my opinion , " he told the @entity30			0
he pushed in one of the car windows , which had bullet holes in it , to turn off the engine -- and saw the bodies inside			0
" i 've never seen people who 've been shot before for real ... but it seemed to me just like a @entity40 scene , and if someone had said ' cut ' and everybody got up and walked away , that would have been it			2
but unfortunately , it was real life			0
... it became quite obvious now , taking stock , that it was a gun crime , " he said			0
realizing that whoever was responsible could still be in the area , @entity25 became increasingly anxious but faced a dilemma			0
he had no cell phone signal to call emergency services , but the girl appeared too badly injured for him to carry her down the mountain			0
@entity25 decided to leave her in a safe position and set off back down the road on his bike to summon help			0
he managed to flag down a car and asked the @entity14 motorist to call for help , before returning to the scene to check on the girl , who was then unconscious			1
he added that he was not surprised that @entity14 police had failed to spot a second child , a 4 - year - old girl , hiding in the back of the car under her dead mother 's legs , for nearly eight hours			1
the girl , who has been reunited with other family members , told investigators she heard noise but saw nothing			0
young girl found alive among bodies in @entity14 @entity25 , from @entity193 in southern @entity194 , went back to @entity14 on wednesday to retrace his route and see if new recollections came to mind			1
the pilot , who now works in civil aviation and has a family business in @entity103 , had given a detailed statement to police immediately after the shooting , including details of vehicles that passed him on the road , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

the 7 - year - old girl is potentially the only person now alive who saw the killings , authorities say
a @entity14 prosecutor and judge are in @entity4 seeking new leads in the case
a @entity4 cyclist who was first at the scene of the shootings recounts what he saw
@entity82 , his wife and mother - in - law were shot dead , along with a @entity14 cyclist
