-- strong countries need a thriving middle class , but in @entity5 today , the people who have to work for a living are getting squeezed			1
republicans in @entity7 are poised to vote this week on a plan to make it even worse , selling out the middle class to enrich the already rich			0
with their latest budget , @entity6 are stacking the deck for special interests -- and whether you 're a student , parent , commuter or senior citizen , @entity6 will force you to pick up the costs so that special interests get their tax breaks			2
in @entity21 , too many people speak in vague hyperbole			0
so let 's look at the numbers in the @entity6 budget and see exactly how its priorities would affect real @entity5			1
many economists predict that this budget will lead to a loss of more than 3 million jobs , according to the @entity32			0
the @entity6 ' budget makes life harder at every turn for the average person trying to succeed in @entity5			2
if you are a student at @entity38 -- in @entity40 rep. @entity40 's district in @entity41 -- the @entity6 budget would make you pay interest on student loans while you 're sitting in class , raising a total of $ 40 billion for the @entity46			1
not by coincidence , the biggest and wealthiest oil companies get $ 40 billion in taxpayer subsidies			0
if you are a middle - class commuter in my congressional district on @entity54 and you 're trying to drive from @entity55 on the @entity56 to get to your job in @entity58 , this budget gives you more brake lights and potholes			1
it strips $ 52 billion out of road repair and infrastructure improvements			0
on the other hand , if you 're a corporation in @entity58 , the @entity6 budget keeps tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas			2
if you are a middle - class senior citizen living in rep. @entity73 ' district near @entity74 , @entity75 , your costs increase 11 % right away			1
you 'll have to pay another $ 1,200 for your prescription drugs after this budget reopens the prescription drug doughnut hole			1
future generations of seniors get an even worse deal -- they would get a @entity83 voucher or have to pay up to 56 % more just to get the benefits @entity83 offers today			0
and finally , if you are middle - class parents with children in rep. @entity89 's district in @entity90 , @entity91 , this budget increases your taxes $ 2,000 , according to the @entity93			1
but if you are making more than $ 1 million in anywhere else in @entity5 , you get a $ 200,000 tax cut , says @entity96			2
in short , republicans are turning their backs on the middle class			0
@entity100 have the backs of the middle class			0
@entity102 @entity100 have launched a sweeping national project -- " battleground : @entity105 " -- and we are already communicating with voters in 76 districts around the country to tell them how the @entity6 budget would cost them more in every aspect of their lives , whether it 's higher taxes , worse roads , costlier college educations or an end to the @entity83 guarantee			2
the @entity5 people want their representatives in @entity21 to focus on strengthening the economy , making sure everyone has a shot at getting a better job and can count on a secure retirement -- which is exactly what @entity100 have proposed			0
for middle - class voters , the 2014 midterms will come down to one question : who 's got our backs ? the debate over our budget answers that question			1
we will fight from now until november to protect middle - class families from these backward priorities that threaten their financial security , cost us jobs and hold our economy back			1
join us on @entity141 / @entity140 .			0
