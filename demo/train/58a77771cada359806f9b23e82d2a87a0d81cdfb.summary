-- for many @entity1 , this summer has been miserably hot			1
heat advisories and warnings have been issued from coast to coast , with high temperatures often reaching into the triple digits , and july went into the record books as the hottest month ever for the continental @entity1			1
but in certain parts of the world , this is the norm -- or maybe even on the cool side			2
try @entity12 , for instance			0
in july , its average high temperature is 116 degrees @entity16			2
or @entity17 in @entity18 , where the highs average 108 in may and was once recorded at 130			2
130 ! that ranks fifth on the all - time list			0
the highest temperature ever recorded on the planet was in 1922 , when a thermometer in @entity25 , @entity26 , hit 136			1
some dispute that mark , saying it was improperly measured			0
if that 's true , the record would be the 134 , reached nine years earlier in @entity31 , @entity32			2
but the world 's hottest place might not be any of these , according to a team of scientists from the @entity37			1
it says the highest temperatures on @entity40 are found in areas that do n't even have weather stations			1
" the @entity40 's hot deserts -- such as the @entity49 , the @entity50 , the @entity51 and the @entity52 -- are climatically harsh and so remote that access for routine measurements and maintenance of a weather station is impractical , " said @entity43 , lead author of a recent study that used @entity46 satellites to detect the @entity40 's hottest surface temperatures			1
the satellites detect the infrared energy emitted by land			0
and over a seven - year period , from 2003 to 2009 , they found @entity61 's @entity52 to be the hottest place on @entity40			1
the @entity52 had the highest recorded surface temperature in five of the seven years , topping out at 159 degrees in 2005			1
other notable annual highs came from @entity65 , @entity66 ( 156 degrees in 2003 ) and @entity68 's @entity67 ( 152 degrees in 2008 )			2
why to expect more weather disasters it 's important to stress that surface temperatures are naturally higher than the air temperatures measured by weather stations			1
air temperatures have to be measured by thermometers placed off the ground and shielded from sunlight , according to global meteorological standards			2
but the study shows that today 's modern records might not necessarily be the most accurate			0
" most of the places that call themselves the hottest on @entity40 are not even serious contenders , " co-author @entity81 said			0
the world 's highest recorded air temperatures 1			1

@entity95 , @entity96 ( 127 ) @entity97 recorded air temperature ( by continent ) @entity100 : @entity25 , @entity26 ( 136 ) @entity101 : @entity31 , @entity32 ( 134 ) @entity102 : @entity91 , @entity92 ( 129 ) @entity66 : @entity103 , @entity65 ( 128 * ) @entity104 : @entity105 , @entity106 ( 122 ) @entity107 : @entity108 , @entity109 ( 120 ) @entity110 : @entity111 , @entity112 ( 59 ) sources : @entity114 , @entity115 * this temperature was measured using the techniques available at the time of recording , which are different to the standard techniques currently used in @entity66			1
the most likely @entity122 record using standard equipment is an observation of 123 degrees , recorded at @entity125 , @entity66			0
extreme weather : get ready for more , scientists say weather : @entity130 ' biggest threat ? what 's your weather story ? share it with @entity135 photos : extreme heat in the @entity1			1

*scorching* temperatures in the @entity1 are *common* for many other countries
the world 's highest air temperature was recorded in @entity25 , @entity26 , in 1922
but weather stations are n't in some of the world 's hottest spots , scientists say
