a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away ... an @entity1 has spread across the galaxy , and the few remaining @entity3 defend themselves against the sith			1
at the same time , a dispute over trade and treaties is interrupted by ... general @entity9 ? a little confused ? that 's because these familiar elements from " @entity12 " lore are part of @entity16 ' rough draft for the first movie ( " @entity20 " for the uninitiated ) , illustrated for the first time by @entity19 as " @entity12			1
" the first of eight issues of the comic book series is out now			1
when @entity9 is a much older man , @entity26 does n't wear a helmet , @entity25 resembles a lizard and there is a character named @entity31 , it might take some getting used to			1
but it 's a fascinating part of movie history , no doubt			2
@entity34 spoke separately to @entity35 , who adapted @entity16 ' script for comics , and artist @entity38			1
@entity34 : what captured your interest when adapting this script ? @entity35 : it 's so similar and yet so different at the same time			1
all the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture			0
you 've got @entity48 and @entity3 , you 've got a desert planet			0
you 've got a planet with twin suns , an imperial city and a cloud city			0
when i read the rough draft , it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book			1
it 's such a great story , @entity16 is a great storyteller			1
@entity34 : was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago ? @entity38 : not at all			2
i 've been in comics 20 years , and when i read the rough draft , i thought , i can make a comic of this tomorrow			1
it was just a very well - written screenplay , and that 's what a comic book script is			1
this is genuinely @entity16 's first complete screenplay story of this tale , and it 's wildly different			1
you can see why some of it was changed because there 's no way they could have done it			2
it was just too ambitious			0
when you look at movies now like " avatar " and " @entity87 , " it seems prophetic			0
audiences expect all that action and set pieces , and one thing after another			0
i 'm sure back then they looked at this and thought , " what 's this guy thinking ? " the other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love			1
@entity26 is kind of a general , he 's one of the main heavies but he 's not a lord of the @entity48			2
here , @entity26 is really three characters : @entity107 , this lord of the sith named @entity110 , and this mechanical man			2
you think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins			2
@entity34 : what do you think fans will take away from this book ? @entity35 : based on early fan feedback from the first issue , they 're really enjoying this alternate universe , and they 're getting to read a story that 's being told by @entity16			1
even through my adaptation , you feel his voice			0
you see many of the things you love in " @entity12 " but in a slightly different way			1
you have the @entity133 raider moment surging in front of the binoculars , except it 's not a @entity133 raider , it 's a different character			2
fans are saying they 're reading it two or three times to take it all in			0
@entity38 : this to me is the greatest " what if " story in comics			0
what if this made it to the screen ? the mind reels at the possibilities			0
@entity34 : is there one particular thing that is farthest away from the " @entity12 " we know and love ? @entity35 : everyone seems to latch onto the fact that @entity25 is a big green alien			1
that 's pretty far ! he does n't have his own ship			2
his character is probably the most different , although he can already talk to @entity163			0
it 's fascinating to see all this stuff starting out , in a way			2
what 's really fun is that @entity169 talks in this one			0
there 's a couple of points where i felt like " @entity169 should say something here , " and i added a line and that was really fun			0
@entity38 : the characters in this story are much different than the characters in " @entity12			1
" the relationships are a lot different and to me , more intense			0
@entity182 's story is a little more complicated , and she 's more a part of the action			0
@entity185 is more of a trained @entity3 than @entity9 was			0
the older @entity186 to me is so much cooler than @entity187			0
this character is like @entity189 , a bigger than life hero			0
@entity34 : is there a possibility that this alternate version of " @entity12 " could live on beyond these eight issues , at least in the fans ' minds ? @entity35 : fans have been asking already about this , because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue , about the past , or characters in the periphery , or just spoken of and not seen			1
they 'd love to see those mysteries explained , but we have a little movie called " @entity207 " coming up and that will take precedence			0
' @entity12 ' cinematographer @entity210 dies at 99 @entity211 talks production plans for ' @entity12 '			1

new comic book " @entity12 " adapts and illustrates @entity16 ' rough draft script
" it 's so similar , yet so different at the same time , " says writer @entity35
characters such as @entity31 and a lizard - like @entity25 populate this universe
