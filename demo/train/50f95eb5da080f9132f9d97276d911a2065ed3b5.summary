-- the next generation of space robot is here			1
it looks like an astronaut in a spacesuit , with a head , a torso , two arms and two hands that can grasp and hold objects just like a human hand			0
its name is @entity14 , short for @entity15			1
and it 's heading to the @entity17 aboard the space shuttle discovery in september			1
for more than three years , a team of @entity21 engineers and @entity23 scientists worked side by side at the @entity27 's @entity26 -- designing , engineering and building the 300 - pound , human - like machine			2
at first , the partnership between a space agency and an auto maker may seem unlikely but it made perfect sense for the @entity14 venture			1
@entity21 has used both industrial and commercial robots in its auto assembly plants , mainly single - arm robots			0
" we 've used robots for years and years , " said @entity39 , @entity21 's principal robotics engineer			2
" we use robots in basically every single one of our manufacturing plants today around the world			0
" turns out that what the astronauts need on a space mission is not very different from what an operator in an assembly plant needs			1
" we spent a lot of effort working on the technologies that will allow us to have robots work right next to human operators very safely , " @entity39 said			0
" for @entity21 , it 's really about the the technologies and being able to make the robots safe to work around			0
" @entity23 has the same goal			0
" this project exemplifies the promise that a future generation of robots can have both in space and on @entity68 , not as replacements for humans but as companions that can carry out key supporting roles , " said a statement from @entity61 , director of @entity23 's @entity62			1
" the combined potential of humans and robots is a perfect example of the sum equaling more than the parts , " he said			0
" it will allow us to go further and achieve more than we can probably even imagine today			0
" @entity39 said the @entity14 will be an astronaut 's helper			1
" that 's really what it was designed to do , to help astronauts in performing their regular tasks , " @entity39 said			1
and at @entity21 , he said , the @entity14 was about developing technologies that will help build safer manufacturing plants and better - quality vehicles			2
it 's hoped that the robot will minimize danger to astronauts , relieve them of ergonomically challenging tasks as well as jobs that are dull and repetitive			1
@entity14 will be able to perform a variety of experiments in micro-gravity , basically working side - by - side with the astronauts , but will still be in a testing phase when it arrives at the @entity17			1
it is n't built to withstand the extreme temperatures in space , so it will be confined to a lab inside the station			0
but in the years ahead , scientists hope the @entity14 will be enhanced enough to move freely around the complex			2
is the @entity14 a precursor of things to come ? are there robotic teachers and robotic drivers in the near future ? how about robotic babysitters or store clerks ? " i 'm a big fan of imagination , " @entity39 said			2
" and certainly you could imagine all those things			0
is it that far off ? i do n't think so			0

the robot 's name is @entity14 , short for @entity15
@entity14 will travel to the @entity17 aboard the space shuttle discovery
@entity14 is able to perform experiments in micro-gravity , working with astronauts
