@entity0 says it was love at first touch			2
@entity3 , who is now blind , likes to tease that she met her husband , @entity4 , on a blind date			2
at the end of the night , he took her hands in his			2
she had little sight then and none now , but her journey into darkness started more than 30 years ago , long before she met her husband			2
as a small child , she developed arthritis that also attacked her eyes , eventually robbing her of her sight			1
when she was about 3 years old , @entity3 says her mother noticed she was bumping into things as she 'd play			2
after going from doctor to doctor , @entity3 was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and a rare eye disease called uveitis			1
the same inflammation that caused swollen painful joints had spread to her eyes			1
what it 's like to be a blind parent " the best i remember seeing , even as a child , was the big e on an eye chart with my left eye , " says @entity3			2
her right eye saw far less , glimpsing only peripheral shadows			2
her eye disease , uveitis , means inflammation or swelling in the middle part of the eye called the uvea			1
doctors only diagnose about 2,250 cases each year in children younger than 16			1
most young people with uveitis also have juvenile arthritis			1
but only about one out of 10 children with arthritis also develop the disease in their eyes			1
if not treated early , uveitis can damage vision and in some cases lead to blindness , according to the @entity56			1
" in children who typically get uveitis , it starts so gradually , so insidiously , that the eye never becomes red and they never experience pain and they do n't know that they 're losing vision			1
in fact , a common way to pick it up is to be screened with your vision when you 're starting school , " says @entity3 ' physician , dr. @entity62 , chief of rheumatology at @entity64 in @entity65 , and chief of ophthalmology at @entity68			1
because 80 % of childhood uveitis occurs in children with juvenile arthritis , @entity62 suggests parents should immediately take their children in for a checkup as if they would take them in for a complaints about an ankle or knee			1
@entity3 got steroid eye drops to reduce swelling ; that 's the standard first line treatment for uveitis			1
but because her case was severe and the medications limited , she developed cataracts and needed eye surgery			2
in high school , she tried methotrexate , a chemotherapy drug , to treat both her eyes and her painful arthritis			1
but @entity3 did n't respond well to the treatment and had to stop			1
15 diseases doctors often get wrong in 2002 , a couple of years after getting married and moving to @entity65 , she discovered a new drug called @entity102 that brought relief to her aching joints			1
she also discovered she was pregnant with her first daughter , @entity105			2
a little over two years later , she gave birth to @entity108			2
and then after a family vacation in january of 2008 , @entity3 ' eyesight started to change , her vision literally disappearing			1
" i remember looking in the mirror and thinking , i 'm fading away			0
it was like a white fog , like in the shower when it gets fogged up			0
it was thickening and thickening , and i was struggling to see , " says @entity3			0
and in the months after her world went dark forever , her oldest @entity105 who was about 5 , started limping around on her ankle			0
" we noticed that her foot was very swollen and very feverish to the touch and it was really severe , " says @entity3			0
they thought it was badly sprained , but it turned out to be juvenile arthritis			1
and shortly afterward , 3 - year - old @entity108 went with her dad for a routine eye exam			0
invisible chronic illness " my husband called me after the appointment that day , and he was quiet			0
he was crying , and he said that @entity108 was diagnosed with uveitis , " says @entity3			1
but the family tried to turn the bad situation into something fun			0
friday night in their house was shot night -- not your typical bar shots for a friday of celebrating -- but injections			0
@entity4 gave all three girls shots			0
at that time , @entity105 and @entity0 got medicine to suppress their immune systems to fight inflammation and @entity108 got methotrexate			0
afterward , they piled in the car to go get ice cream			0
and now more than five years later , @entity108 is in remission and her eyesight has not been affected			0
thanks to early diagnosis and treatment with biologic drugs such as @entity102 , which control swelling , she is doing well			1
these new medicines put the brakes on the misbehaving parts of the immune system that fuels inflammation			0
these were not available when @entity0 was a young child			1
their doctor says @entity108 has a good chance of retaining her sight throughout her life			0
new smartphone app promises easy eye testing worldwide @entity105 's arthritis still does flare up from time to time , making it hard to go up and down stairs or participate in @entity173 at school			1
both girls do tend to get sick more than other kids because their medicines leave their immune system less able to fight infections			1
but their doctors do n't think either sister will develop the other 's illness			2
and though @entity0 knows there are more struggles ahead for all of them , she says , " find joy in everything if you can			0
@entity0 , i say , is a choice			0
it 's more than just my name ; it 's a choice our family has had to choose			0
" and when she wants to visualize her world , she returns to one of her best tools , touch			0
as she cuddles with her girls , she takes their faces in her hands			0
" i feel them grow , and their faces change			0
i feel their smiles , " says @entity3 .			0
