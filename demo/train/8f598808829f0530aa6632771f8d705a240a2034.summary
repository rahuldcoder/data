-- @entity1 filed a motion thursday to dismiss a lawsuit in which a former worker accuses the @entity6 star of hacking into his personal accounts and attempting to frame him for using child porn			1
@entity9 , who was @entity1 's personal computer consultant from 2008 to 2009 , said the @entity6 center acted in retaliation because @entity13 had proof that @entity1 cheated on his wife with several women			1
but @entity1 's lawyer claims in the motion that @entity13 illegally obtained the supposedly incriminating e-mails , text messages and voice mails to support his " baseless " lawsuit in an effort to " extort " @entity1 and sully his name			1
" @entity13 reveals his true intent and methodology in using the stolen material , " @entity1 's @entity26 - based lawyer , @entity25 , writes in the motion			1
" the @entity33 's rambling , unsupported allegations , through which @entity13 alleges that he possesses substantial knowledge that would harm the defendant both in a separate and unrelated lawsuit , as well as in the public eye at large , render @entity13 's nefarious motive clear			2
" the 13 - page response , filed thursday in @entity40 , also argues that @entity13 's claims of privacy invasion , racketeering and intentional infliction of emotional distress are unsupported by any legal theory			1
" even if everything he was saying were true , we believe there is no basis in the law to bring the case , " @entity25 told @entity0 thursday			0
" but in this case , none of it 's true			0
" the salacious 15 - page complaint describes @entity1 's alleged dealings with three women and his ex-wife , whom he was divorcing at the time			2
@entity13 claims he was drawn into @entity1 's tangled affairs as a computer consultant , eventually acquiring enough information to make him a liability that @entity1 then sought to have arrested , according to the lawsuit , which was filed in august and reported wednesday for the first time on @entity68			1
@entity25 said the lawsuit came about after @entity1 refused to pay @entity13 $ 12 million in return for copies of physical and electronic files that @entity13 , a convicted felon , stole from @entity1 while he was working for him			1
@entity13 's lawyer , however , said the e-mails , texts and pictures in his possession came from accounts in @entity13 's name that @entity1 asked him to set up for him to use to contact his various mistresses			1
when @entity1 realized the damning nature of the evidence @entity13 had , he began working with associates and contacts in law enforcement to have @entity13 arrested for possessing child porn on his computer , @entity13 's attorney , @entity81 said			1
@entity13 filed the lawsuit out of a real fear that @entity1 would act on his alleged plans , the lawyer said			1
" i do n't need anyone to take my client 's word for it			0
i have the evidence : text messages from @entity1 , e-mails complaining about how my client is going to ruin him , " @entity81 said wednesday			0
" anyone who says the evidence is not there , he 'll eat those words			0
" @entity1 , who this summer signed with the @entity107 , employed @entity13 while @entity1 lived primarily in @entity26			2
during that time , @entity13 performed various odd jobs that gave him access to @entity1 's e-mail and cell phone accounts , the complaint states			1
@entity13 's lawyer claims he was hired as an independent contractor for the specific purpose of helping him retrace all the e-mails and texts he 'd sent to @entity117 , a woman who claimed to have a relationship with @entity1 , and who 'd accused him of harassment			1
" in the end , my client could n't get @entity122 to give him all the information from [ @entity1 's ] account without getting lawyers involved , " @entity81 said			2
" after that , @entity1 used my client and his personal property to send text messages and e-mails to contact his mistresses			0
" the lawsuit contains allegations that @entity1 used law enforcement contacts to obtain information about @entity117 , and that he hacked into a phone belonging to @entity138 , erasing messages and changing her password			0
the lawsuit also accuses @entity1 and an associate of throwing his computer into a lake after @entity13 performed a " ' @entity147 ' type wipe " of the computer			2
@entity13 also claims that @entity1 believes he has pictures of him with @entity150			0
as a result , the lawsuit alleges , @entity1 has attempted to " control " @entity13 's actions through threats of violence and attempts to frame him for possession of child pornography and to have him arrested using @entity1 's extensive law enforcement contacts			1
" @entity1 knows that @entity13 not only has knowledge of his bad acts that might be used against him in litigation , but @entity1 also knows that @entity13 has evidence that shows he cheated on his former wife [ @entity165 ] with many more people than just @entity138 , " the lawsuit states			2
" @entity13 is in apprehension and fears for his safety , " the lawsuit says			0
@entity1 's lawyer issued a statement after the lawsuit was reported on wednesday that described @entity13 as an ex-con who has served time in a federal prison in @entity178 for misusing social security numbers , and said @entity13 failed to disclose the prison record to @entity1			1
an online inmate search of the @entity182 showed that a man named @entity9 was released on march 22 , 2002			0
@entity13 's lawyer acknowledged his criminal history			0
" but that does n't make him liar , " he said			0
@entity1 's lawyer , however , said the case would come down to credibility of the parties involved			2
@entity25 said @entity13 used his position to copy @entity1 's e-mails and communications			1
over the past 12 months and through three separate lawyers , he has demanded $ 12 million for their return , @entity25 said			0
when @entity1 refused to cooperate with @entity13 , he filed the lawsuit , @entity25 said			2
the complaint seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial			0
" it does n't take much to file a suit and unfortunately , this seems pretty common in our society			0
people target celebrities , " he said .			0
