-- @entity2 's oil and gas potential will grow significantly over the next two decades , driven by population growth , urbanization and the emergence of a wealthier middle class on the continent			1
six of the top 10 global discoveries in the oil and gas sector in 2013 were made in @entity2 , with more than 500 companies currently exploring deposits there			1
there were nearly nine million barrels of crude oil produced daily in @entity2 last year , with more than 80 % of it coming from established players such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
this is all good news for @entity2 , but look behind the figures and the story is more about gas than oil			1
excitement remains around large gas finds in @entity28 and @entity29 , but even here there is much hype and unknowns			2
the scale of these @entity2 finds is not in doubt but developing these discoveries will be massively expensive and a long - term investment			1
@entity28 's gas investment in particular will be dependent on what future gas prices will be -- and this is changing quickly due to the oil and gas revolution			0
changing landscape ten years ago , gas investments in the @entity45 were made to service the @entity47 market			2
today , that market has disappeared and the @entity47 itself is exporting gas , while @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity50 are now exporting to @entity51 and @entity52			0
indeed , a decade ago it was unimaginable that @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 oil exports to the @entity47 would have plummeted so dramatically and that @entity55 would so soon become the second largest importer of @entity2 oil after @entity58			2
the lesson is that the international market can change quickly in response to technological innovation and geo - politics			0
if @entity58 and @entity64 develop their shale gas reserves , or if @entity68 discovers and develops major reserves under the @entity70 , then @entity2 's mid-term prospects could change significantly			2
@entity71 -- the world 's largest source of liquefied natural gas -- could decide to export more , also changing the calculus			0
the gas sector is currently concentrated in @entity2 , with nine - tenths of annual production volumes coming from @entity20 , @entity79 , @entity18 and @entity80			1
gas is more costly to develop and export			0
i worry that governments in @entity2 have become intoxicated by industry hype and have not managed public expectations -- not only is future gas pricing less certain , but the profits following the large investments are much lower than oil			1
unlocking the potential there is no doubt that @entity2 remains significantly under - explored by oil and gas companies			1
the price of oil and the incentives for exploration partly determine this , but major investors are also cautious because of the lingering challenges of corruption , lack of infrastructure and regulation			0
as regulatory frameworks tighten in the @entity47 and @entity51 , international oil companies have to be more careful about how they conduct their business			2
the corruption allegations over @entity112 in @entity20 are a reminder of this -- but it is not only big oil companies that are impacted			0
the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) investigation into @entity47 - listed @entity119 has ensured that despite its exciting hydrocarbon in the @entity19 pre-salt concessions it is unable to farm out to a major or super major international oil company and its share price has suffered			0
likewise , the @entity127 - based oil and gas company @entity126 's share price tumbled in 2013 when the @entity47 @entity128 and the @entity117 requested documents relating to its business in @entity50			1
look carefully and you can see the oil industry responding to greater scrutiny			0
in @entity19 this year , the @entity135 oil company @entity134 successfully flipped its equity exposure from a partner that raised eyebrows to two small international oil companies with better probity records			0
although finding oil and gas in @entity2 can still be low cost , developing it needs deep financial investment and long - term commitment			1
@entity2 governments that manage better their regulatory and business environment are more likely to attract this type of investment that is needed to unlock their natural resource endowments , which in turn can generate revenue			1
read this : how @entity2 's resources fuel the world read this : @entity2 's giant infrastructure projects the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

6 of the top 10 global oil and gas discoveries in 2013 were made in @entity2
yet , developing these finds requires massive , long - term investments
countries must improve regulatory and business environment to attract investors
