-- @entity2 's love affair with the @entity3 will be rekindled when its 101st edition starts saturday in a region famed for the literary works of the @entity8 sisters and the rugged terrain which provided the setting for their most famous novels			1
the grueling three week - test over 3,664 kilometers , taking in the unforgiving mountains of the @entity14 and @entity15 , will finish in @entity16 on july 27 , but in recent years @entity17 has often taken place outside of @entity19 to widen the appeal of cycling 's most iconic race			0
beating off bids from @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity26 -- which at 15,000 square kilometers and with a population of five million is the biggest county in @entity28 -- got the nod from race organizers in 2012			1
its biggest city @entity33 will host the start of two days of racing in @entity26 with the first stage finishing in @entity37 and the second going from the cathedral city of @entity39 to @entity40			2
it will pass through the @entity42 , the @entity43 and the @entity44 , with stiff climbs that will provide an early test for the 198 riders from 22 teams teams of nine			0
the second leg sunday will indeed see the peloton speed through the small town of @entity52 where the @entity8 's -- @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 -- lived in the early 19th century			2
their most famous works , @entity58 , @entity59 are literary classics set against the backdrop of the wild and windswept moors that surround their birthplace in the @entity65			0
local organizers are banking that the worldwide appeal of the @entity3 will showcase the history and heritage of their region -- dubbed " @entity26 " by locals -- and attract new tourism			1
if the huge crowds which greeted the last visit of @entity77 to @entity2 in 2007 are anything to go by , that is pretty much guaranteed			0
all over @entity26 , @entity52 included , towns and cities on the route are bedecked with welcoming signs and references to the unique magic of a race which started in 1903 with the aim of boosting the circulation of a @entity19 newspaper @entity88 and has grown to become the biggest spectator event in the sporting calendar			2
" the race has excited the public and cycling community and is the biggest sporting event to take place anywhere in the @entity2 in 2014 , " said @entity91 , the editor of the website @entity93 and a veteran observer of the @entity2 cycling scene			0
over a million people are expected to line the roads for the two stages in @entity26 and the third from @entity105 to the @entity2 capital @entity107 , before the race heads to its traditional home in @entity19 for the remaining 18 stages			1
the pre-race buildup has been dominated by a row over the decision to leave @entity2 's most famous cyclist , @entity114 , out of the @entity116 lineup			1
@entity117 made history when he won the 2012 edition of the tour before going on to claim @entity123 gold a week later at the @entity124			0
with his trademark sideburns and ' @entity127 ' fashion sense , @entity117 assumed cult status and became a national hero , but his ongoing rivalry with fellow @entity116 member @entity131 has since taken on the sort of brooding intrigue which would not have been out of place in a @entity8 novel			1
@entity131 , who had been his right hand man in helping @entity117 win the @entity3 , still finishing a fine second , duly won last year 's race , with @entity117 absent after illness and crashes in an abortive attempt at claiming the preceding @entity142			1
@entity117 might have been expected to return to the @entity116 squad this year , particularly with the race starting in @entity2 , but instead has been left on the sidelines			1
his devoted fans believe @entity131 -- who has been quoted as calling his teammate " mentally weak " -- played a part in his exclusion , but this is denied by the @entity152 - born @entity2 rider			1
" just to make it absolutely clear , i do not have a role in selection , " @entity131 told gathered reporters ahead of the start			2
@entity116 chief @entity158 said the decision had " kept him awake at night , but lauded the 29 - year - old @entity131 as the " the best stage race rider in the world			1
" either way , while @entity131 and his eight teammates begin their quest to bring @entity116 a third straight yellow jersey , @entity117 will likely be training at the @entity166 ahead of riding the 4km individual and team pursuit at the @entity168 in @entity169			1
" the most popular opinion is that @entity117 should ride , both from public and avid cycling fans and even many of ' informed ' inside the sport , " said @entity91 , who has followed his career since he was a youngster			0
but to understand while @entity117 -- who may well have been capable of finishing on the podium -- has been left out it is necessary to examine the dynamics of a cycling team in its approach to races like the @entity3			1
the entire @entity116 squad will act as " domestiques " or helpers for @entity131 , sacrificing their own chances to help him claim the yellow jersey in @entity16			1
at best , @entity117 would have been a " super domestique " -- which is a rider who might be expected to step up to the plate if a mishap or illness befell the team leader @entity131			1
@entity158 has given his role to @entity193 @entity192 , hailing the @entity194 as a " @entity196 winner of the future " but has courted further controversy by leaving out young @entity2 stars @entity199 and @entity201 , who finished first and second at their national championship last weekend			0
with @entity201 omitted it will leave @entity116 without a recognized sprinter , the riders designated to contest the bunch finishes at the end of predominantly flat stages			2
despite its recent dominance of cycling at the @entity3 and in the @entity123 , @entity2 will only have four competitors in this year 's race , but in @entity213 and sprint king @entity214 ( @entity215 ) it has two jewels in the crown			0
@entity214 , who has used his finishing speed to win 25 @entity3 stages , will be hoping his teammates can help him don the yellow jersey after the first stage which finishes in his mother 's home town of @entity37			2
last year 's green jersey winner @entity225 of @entity226 and @entity228 @entity227 and @entity229 will be his main challengers in these finishes -- with all looking to win the coveted final stage on the @entity233 in the @entity19 capital			0
but the fastest men on two wheels are not contenders for the overall crown , usually losing time on the mountain stages and the individual time trials which decide that ultimate honor			0
@entity131 has proved his worth in both those disciplines , winning the @entity244 by over four minutes from @entity245 of the @entity246			0
@entity247 @entity245 won the @entity142 earlier this year , but has decided against a tilt at the @entity3 , leaving two - time winner @entity249 as the likely main challenger to @entity131			1
@entity249 courted controversy after a positive drugs test which annulled his 2010 @entity3 triumph and the @entity254 has struggled to repeat his earlier victories since serving his ban , but impressive performances in 2014 serve notice of his abilities			0
the 31 - year - old always protested his innocence after failing a doping control for the banned stimulant @entity264 , but his presence as a podium contender will act as a constant reminder that cycling is still struggling to shrug off the doping controversies which have continually haunted the sport			0
on the eve of the tour came the revelation that @entity274 , the first @entity275 to wear the yellow jersey last year , had tested positive back in february after his national championships for a banned substance @entity278			0
he was withdrawn from the race by his @entity281 team while @entity131 , who has known @entity274 since his time in school in @entity275 , said that the news was a " big shock to me			2
" @entity3 organizers will be hoping this year 's event passes off without a further doping story , preferring the positive images of massive crowds lining the route in both @entity2 and @entity19 to cheer on their heroes rather than the darker side of the sport .			0
