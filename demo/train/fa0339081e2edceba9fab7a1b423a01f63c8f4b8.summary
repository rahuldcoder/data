-- @entity1 ! blllttt ! that 's the sound of the whoopee cushion that @entity4 placed on the chairs of his co-workers while filming the first " @entity8 " movie			1
i was on the set one day during the shoot , working on a feature for the @entity13 -- a day punctuated by loud , gassy - sounding eruptions , often followed by @entity15 cackling insanely at his juvenile pranks			1
yep , @entity4 , who died yesterday at the age of 84 , was that kind of guy			1
a jokester inside a leading man 's body			0
a straight man with comedic instincts			0
someone who always knew he was basically @entity26 , but did n't get to prove it until he 'd been a working actor for nearly 30 years			0
so while we 're chuckling , as we go about our lives today , at the very thought of bumbling lt. @entity31 , and all those other clueless wonders he so effortlessly portrayed , let us give thanks that @entity15 got the chance to show us his comedic chops			2
we are all the richer , and happier , for it			0
actually , let 's thank those @entity41 guys -- @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 -- the co-directors of the 1980 film " airplane , " who cast the @entity49 actor against type as a dumber - than - dirt doctor , whose response to the line " surely you ca n't be serious " was the classic " i am serious , and do n't call me @entity57			1
" the exchange is so famous , it popped up at no. 79 on the @entity60 's list of @entity61			0
@entity4 dead at 84 from that point on , @entity15 -- who had been making a living as a handsome , but rather stiff , leading man in such films as " @entity66 , " " @entity67 " and " @entity68 " -- had found his calling			1
or , as he put it when people questioned casting him in " airplane " : " i 've always been cast against type before			2
" " airplane , " of course , led to the short - lived but much beloved tv series " @entity76 , " with @entity15 as the utterly bewildered @entity31			2
despite its failure on the tube , the @entity41 guys , seeing its real potential , restructured it as a feature film , 1988 's " @entity84 , " which was so successful it spawned two sequels			0
in all these films , and such later work as " @entity89 , " " dracula : dead and loving it " and " @entity101 , " the @entity15 style rapidly became famous : a combination of physical pratfalls , straight - faced delivery , and absurd dialogue aimed straight at 14 - year - olds -- and adults who quickly rediscovered the 14 - year - old within			0
@entity102 : share your memories of @entity4 " it 's true what they say , " says @entity31 in a typically ridiculous comment from " @entity84			1
" " cops and women do n't mix. it 's like eating a spoonful of @entity113 ; sure , it 'll clean you out , but it 'll leave you hollow inside			0
" always a master at double takes and popeyed wonder , @entity4 was a genius when it came to deadpan			1
no matter what was happening around him , the elegant - looking , silver - haired actor seemed to be in a world of his own , and that was the point			0
@entity125 became his metier , a means and end in itself , an eternally funny comedic riff that @entity15 seemed born to play			0
he was helped , of course , by the endless non sequiturs in the " airplane " and " @entity8 " scripts , all heavily influenced by the anarchic lunacy of @entity134			1
but @entity4 's gift was that , unlike comic actors who might give a wink - wink , nudge - nudge to lines like " it 's fourth and 15 and you 're looking at a full court press , " he recited them with a gravity that sounded like it came straight from " @entity144			1
" who could resist ? from drama to comedy , @entity4 made it look easy certainly not the critics , who appreciated @entity4 's art , if not always the films he appeared in			1
reviewing " @entity84 " in the @entity152 , @entity153 -- who called the @entity41 comedy style " proudly sophomoric " -- added that the film had an aura of " unexpected sophistication , " thanks to the " dapper presence of @entity4 who , as lt. @entity31 , manages to bring something heroic to the role of a perfectly oblivious fall guy			2
" @entity4 , of course , was never really oblivious ; he knew exactly what he was doing every second he was onscreen			2
but unlike a lot of funny guys , who are actually sober and morose in real life , what you saw with @entity15 was what you got : he really was a goofball			0
so when we think about the passing of a man who gave us so much to laugh at , what else is there to say but -- phhhhttttt ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 says @entity4 pulled on - set pranks during " @entity8 " shoots
@entity4 , who died *sunday* , came to goofball roles late in a career of playing stiff characters
but he *reveled* in the new deadpan roles , a master at playing dolts , @entity181 says
@entity181 : we 're lucky @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity42 cast him in roles for which he was a natural
