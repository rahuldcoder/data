it was never a ratings smash , but the impact of " @entity3 " ca n't be understated			1
after a somewhat underwhelming first season , critics started to sing the praises of the @entity8 series in season 2 , noting its portrayal of an intelligent , driven woman in charge and one of the most talented comedic casts on television			1
( after all , it gave us @entity18			2
) the show slowly gained a loyal fan base , especially once it was available for binge - watching online			1
now , the names @entity23 and @entity24 are just as beloved as @entity25 or @entity26 to die - hard fans			1
plus , what other show has had cameos by both vice president @entity31 and first lady @entity32 , along with an impressive number of senators and former secretary of state @entity35 ? the show came to a conclusion tuesday night , and it also marked the end of an era at @entity39 , which is losing the last of its thursday night comedies			2
there are so many things to love about " @entity3 , " and we tried to narrow them down to as few as we could : -- treat @entity45 : the holiday so brilliant , it 's surprising it has n't caught on as much as " @entity48			1
give it time , though			0
it is , after all , " the best day of the year ! " -- @entity24 's words of wisdom : for many , the brand of unapologetic maleness of @entity24 has been inspirational , a spot - on , if loving , parody of libertarianism			2
@entity59 's portrayal is as @entity60 - worthy as they come , and it 's a crime he was never recognized as much as he ought to be			2
-- @entity62 : we do n't get much of him , but @entity66 's portrayal of the alarmingly clueless news anchor ( @entity66 is a real - life @entity68 ) is gut - bustingly funny			2
-- @entity70 : the town of @entity73 's love for this little pony is inexplicable , and yet , that makes it one of the funnier storylines this show ever had , especially the memorial service for him			1
-- @entity80 and april : before he was a guardian of the galaxy , @entity18 had us rolling in the aisles as @entity84 ( or @entity85 or @entity86 )			0
when he met the woman of his dreams , the extremely antisocial @entity88 ( @entity89 ) , it was true love , and the couple was married quickly			0
-- @entity94 : we really miss @entity96 's portrayal of the insanely optimistic @entity18 , but we 've always got reruns			0
-- @entity98 : @entity23 's idea to celebrate female friends has caught on in real life			0
-- @entity102 and @entity103 : these two were made for each other , the swaggiest man in @entity73 and , well , @entity103 , who defies explanation but never fails to entertain			1
-- @entity107 's epic " @entity109 " monologue : it went viral a few years ago on @entity111			0
-- cones of @entity113 : the greatest nerdy creation from the mind of @entity116			0
-- @entity23 and @entity116 : for our money , they have been the couple to beat on network television for a while now			0
" @entity3 , " we love you and we like you			1
we do n't know what we 'll do without you , but we 're glad @entity23 and her friends will live on in tv history .			0
