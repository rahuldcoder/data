@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was one half of the songwriting genius behind @entity1 pop legend @entity6			1
after the band split up in 1982 @entity3 turned his talents to writing musicals , including " @entity11 , " now a blockbuster movie			1
@entity3 on the @entity6 phenomenon : " i 'm amazed how this could happen			1
i 'm just grateful and humble			2
" he took @entity15 on a tour of his home town of @entity0 and talked about his past and future as pop royalty			1
@entity2 : what is the secret of @entity6 's success ? @entity3 : i think the secret behind the fact that our songs are still around and that @entity6 became so big is a lot of factors together			1
but one of them was definitely that we put so much effort into song writing			2
we hardly ever toured , we just wrote and wrote and produced the records over a period of seven or eight years			2
so it 's the songs , plus i think the two girls , the voices -- the blend was unique and very special			2
@entity2 : where did get the inspiration for your songs ? @entity47 : well mostly in song writing my experience is that there is n't so much inspiration as hard work			2
you sit there for hours , days and weeks with a guitar and piano until something good comes			0
but the urge to write is something you have to have			0
a conviction , an ambition to write and never stop until you think , " this is the best i can do			0
" watch @entity3 take @entity2 on a tour of @entity0 » @entity2 : what drives you ? @entity47 : in my career the push has always been to take another step , to try something new			1
that means that after @entity6 , when we split up in 1982 , we were onto writing a musical [ " chess " ] because we had n't done that before			1
@entity2 : how do you feel about working in the theater ? @entity47 : every time i sit in the audience and watch a show that i have been involved with , it is such an amazing feeling to see all those people around me , knowing they are actually watching and enjoying something i have written			0
that is such a feeling of pure joy that never goes away and that 's why i guess i 'm so attracted to work in the theater			0
@entity2 : how did " @entity11 ! @entity91 " come about ? @entity47 : when you have a big hit on the @entity95 and on @entity96 with a musical , as we had with " @entity11 , " there is always the question , " when are you going to do the movie ? " some people say you should n't do it until the actual stage musical is on its last legs , but i do n't think that matters			0
we had been on @entity96 for seven or eight years and eight or nine in the @entity95 and we thought now is the time to make that movie			1
@entity2 : how has @entity0 changed over the years ? @entity47 : a city like @entity0 , being so dynamic and following trends , develops all the time			1
it 's gradually changing but you can hardly see that			0
it is changing in a very healthy way that cities should change			0
@entity2 : how would you describe @entity0 in a few words ? @entity47 : @entity0 is unique in the world in that it 's built on , i think , 14 islands			1
there are so many bridges and it does n't have any high - rise buildings to speak of			0
it 's quite spread out and open and airy with lots of parks			0
see photos of @entity3 in @entity0 » @entity2 : let 's talk about the cultural scene in @entity0			1
@entity47 : there is a very vibrant cultural scene in @entity0			1
there are lots of places where there are concerts and there are loads of museums and theaters			0
there is everything really , and eventually there is going to be an @entity6 museum as well			1
@entity2 : when will that happen ? @entity47 : i do n't know -- i like to be arm 's length when it comes to a museum about oneself			2
other people should do that			0
@entity2 : that 's quite a @entity1 trait ... @entity47 : a lot of @entity1 are quite modest and unassuming			1
i think that 's actually the closest you can get to a national trait , if there is one			0
@entity2 : how does it feel that people from different generations are still enjoying @entity6 songs ? @entity47 : in a way i 'm kind of a bystander looking at this phenomenon that is @entity6 , which is still around , and that i thought would be finished in 1981 and forgotten			1
i 'm amazed how this could happen and i do n't know why it happened			2
i 'm just grateful and humble			0
i just sit back and enjoy			0
@entity2 : what would you like your legacy to be ? @entity47 : i would like for my children to feel that what i left behind was something that i did whole heartedly and with honesty , and something that was the best i could do and hopefully that they too can enjoy .			0
