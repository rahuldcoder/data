-- @entity1 dislikes public speaking so much that when she was in high school , she almost failed marketing because she did n't want to speak in front of the class			2
but when the @entity7 made a decision that hurt her little boy @entity9 , she did what any mother would do -- set aside her own fear , spoke up and , with the help of family and friends , is fighting back			1
" i 've never been involved with any kind of activism or anything like that before , so this is all new to me , " the mother of four said			1
" all i know is this has got to stop			2
" and by " this , " she is referring to the @entity7 ' policy of banning gays and lesbians from being members or serving as leaders			1
earlier this month @entity30 was forced to resign as den leader of the @entity32 109 in @entity33 , @entity34 , because the national office learned she is a lesbian			1
so even though everyone in the local chapter loved her , she was forced out by the discrimination that is woven into the organization 's bylaws			2
the cubs of @entity42 are upset			2
but none more than @entity9 , who is being forced to be away from his friends and is too young to fully understand why			2
he was n't brought up to dislike people because they are different			2
he 's too young to understand bigotry			0
which is why @entity30 is not taking any of this lying down			0
she started a change.org petition , in protest of the @entity53 policy , that has amassed more than 120,000 signatures in a matter of days			0
i met @entity30 and her beautiful family at the 23rd annual @entity58 this past weekend			0
numerous celebrities took the stage that night , but only @entity30 managed to hush the crowd , save for a few sobs			0
i can remember sitting there wondering : what in the hell is wrong with them ? the @entity67 , the @entity68 , as well as the @entity69 all welcome gay kids and adult leaders , and none of those organizations bursts into flames			1
needing answers , i reached out to the @entity7 and @entity76 , the organization 's director of public relations , sent me an official statement that in part read : " our focus is on delivering the nation 's foremost youth program of character development and values - based leadership training			1
our mission does not include teaching young people about sex or sexual orientation , and we do not believe it is @entity92 's role to introduce this topic in our youth development program			1
so i asked @entity76 via e-mail if the group had received complaints that @entity30 was attempting to turn the @entity7 into an unofficial sex ed camp			1
he did n't answer that question			0
when i asked if heterosexuals were banned for being heterosexuals , @entity76 said , " @entity102 does not conflict with @entity92 's policy and is not a reason for removal from the program			0
however , if a leader chose to make it a focus of his or her time with youth they could be removed from the program			1
" now i 've never sat in one of @entity30 's meetings , and so i ca n't speak as to what she did or did not do			0
so i asked some folks who would know , the parents of @entity42			1
" i 'm not a city person , " said @entity119			0
" i 'm just a backwoods hick , and i do n't think anybody around here have an issue with homosexuals			1
she did a wonderful job , and what they did to her was just horrible			0
" when i told my son @entity131 was kicked out because she is gay , he did n't know what was wrong because he thought gay meant happy			1
" @entity134 , who has a grandson in @entity42 , e-mailed me , saying either he or his wife has been to " every cub scout meeting my grandson has attended , also to every function , community event , @entity142 ringing bells , collection of food for the needy ...			0
etc. i do not know where you are getting your information , but never ever has sex been brought up , not in any way shape or form			0
in fact , i was not aware of @entity131 even being gay for quite some time ...			1
. was n't an issue or concern			2
" my favorite response came from @entity159 , who said , " the boys knew her as @entity162 , not gay tiger leader @entity131			1
they are only first graders			0
most do n't even understand what ' gay ' or ' lesbian ' mean			2
" so again , i sit and wonder : what in the hell is wrong with them ? while it 's commendable that @entity30 is fighting , i 'm ticked off that she has to			0
it 's 2012 , for heaven 's sake			0
who , after the zoo - like @entity175 trial , still believes being straight automatically makes you a good influence to have around children ? @entity30 is clearly just a good mother , trying to invest in her son			2
she did n't ask to be den leader a little over a year ago -- she was selected because the pack loves her			1
she was chosen to be treasurer because everyone trusts her			0
maybe being loved and trusted conflicts with the values of the @entity7 , because according to the folks who were actually around @entity30 , sexual orientation was never added to the handbook			1
it just does n't make sense			0
then again , bigotry never does			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

an @entity34 mother who is gay has been kicked out as a @entity201 den mother
@entity197 says she was a model leader , *admired* by scouts and parents
he asks why her sexual orientation is an issue for the @entity7
