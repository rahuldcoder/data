@entity0 -- federal transportation safety officials wednesday issued an " urgent " recommendation calling for a redesign of a component on some @entity7 aircraft engines -- a component blamed for two major mishaps in the past year			1
the engines on this @entity12 jet lost power as it prepared to land in @entity14 on january 17 , 2008			0
@entity16 investigators said the @entity18 engine component played a role in the january 17 , 2008 , crash of a @entity12 jet near @entity14 's @entity22			1
both the plane 's engines lost power as the plane approached the runway , and 13 people were injured in the resulting crash			0
ten months later , on november 26 , 2008 , a @entity30 @entity7 was in cruise flight over @entity32 when an engine lost power			1
that plane landed safely in @entity36 after pilots performed a procedure developed in response to the @entity22 crash			0
in both cases , the @entity16 said , a build - up of ice on a fuel / oil heat exchanger restricted the flow of fuel to the @entity18 engines , reducing power			1
" with two of these rollback events occurring within a year , we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again , " @entity16 acting chairman @entity49 said in a news release			1
the @entity57 recently ordered operators of @entity7 777s that use the @entity18 engines to revise flight manuals to give pilots procedures to follow in certain cold weather conditions , outlining steps they should take if their jets experience a reduction of power			1
but the @entity16 said wednesday the @entity57 action does not go far enough			2
" the procedure has worked and it has been effective in significantly reducing the likelihood [ of an incident ] , " said @entity16 spokesman @entity69			2
" but that 's not enough			0
we need a permanent fix			0
" while the emergency procedures work , they add to the complexity of flying the plane and require a descent , which could be hazardous if the plane is not at a sufficient altitude , the @entity16 said			2
some 56 aircraft in the @entity84 fleet and a total of 228 worldwide are equipped with @entity18 engines			1
but the @entity16 stopped short of recommending the planes be grounded			2
@entity69 said the safety board believes the new procedures will significantly address the problem until @entity18 has a new component ready for installation			2
@entity18 indicated it can have a new system ready within 12 months , the @entity16 said			1
" we are encouraged to see that @entity18 is already working on a redesign , and we are confident that with the @entity57 and @entity97 [ @entity97 ] overseeing the process , this flight safety issue -- even one as complex as this -- will be successfully and expeditiously resolved , " @entity49 said			2
the @entity16 recommended that , once @entity18 completes its redesign , the new system be installed on all affected @entity7 's at their next maintenance check or within six months			1
a @entity18 spokesman said : " the report clearly states that the @entity18 equipment on this flight met or exceeded all requirements			0
the report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build up in commercial ' long - cold - high ' routes			0
this is an industry - wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements			0
" " this has been a serious matter for both @entity7 , and the airlines who use the 777 with @entity18 engines , " said @entity116 , @entity1 's aviation correspondent			1
" the development of a permanent mechanical fix will solve the problem			0
until then pilots operating the plane will be on their guard for any signs of the problems re-occurring			0
that said , the plane remains safe to fly , otherwise it would have been grounded by the authorities			0
