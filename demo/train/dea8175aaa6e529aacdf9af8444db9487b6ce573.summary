@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 did n't back off the controversial edict he issued or @entity3 's upcoming constitutional referendum , saying thursday night that he respects peaceful opposition to his decisions but wo n't stand for violence			1
addressing " those who oppose me " and his supporters , @entity2 condemned those involved in recent clashes -- referring specifically to those armed with weapons and who are backed and funded by members of the " corrupt ... ex-regime " -- and promised they 'd be held accountable			1
" ( they ) will not escape punishment , " the president said in a televised speech			2
@entity2 's words not only failed to mollify many protesters on the streets , it further enraged them			1
activists camped in @entity0 's @entity29 chanted " leave ! leave ! leave ! " as the president talked			1
and minutes after the speech ended , the @entity33 headquarters in @entity0 was " ablaze , " state tv reported , citing witnesses			0
the @entity37 group said on its website and @entity39 that the building came under " a terrorist attack , " with hundreds were surrounding it			2
yet by 1 a.m. friday , there was no sign of a fire or significant damage to the building			0
supporters from both sides were at the site , as were security forces between them and the headquarters			2
@entity55 , a senior adviser in the @entity56 , the political wing of the @entity33 that @entity2 once led , wrote on @entity39 that 36 @entity33 and party offices were " destroyed " by opponents in the last two weeks			1
banned under longtime president @entity59 , the @entity33 is now @entity3 's dominant political force			2
on @entity39 , the @entity37 group has said it would hold opposition figures " fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters			1
" @entity66 , a spokesman for @entity3 's newly appointed general prosecutor , said friday morning that @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 are being investigated for allegedly " conspiring to topple " the government			1
all three are well - known internationally -- with @entity69 being a @entity73 laureate and @entity70 a one - time head of the @entity75 -- and are now being probed for their role in the opposition against @entity2 , who defeated all three in this year 's presidential election			1
those taking part in the protests around the @entity83 nation say the scenes are similar to those of the 2011 uprising that led to @entity59 's ouster			2
this time , they say , dissent is being vigorously stamped out by @entity2 's backers in government and on the street			1
specifically , they spoke of thugs with knives and rocks chasing activists , presidential backers belittling opponents and pressure from various quarters to go home and be quiet			2
" it 's exactly the same battle , " said @entity103 , a @entity1 ireporter			2
a november 22 edict by @entity2 , in which he made his decisions immune to judicial oversight until a new constitution is voted upon , set off the latest wave of political unrest			1
and it 's been growing -- and growing more violent -- in recent days			0
ahead of the president 's speech , opposition leaders were specific in what would mollify them : @entity2 must roll back his edict granting himself expanded presidential powers and postpone the scheduled december 15 referendum on a proposed constitution , which they say does n't adequately represent or protect all @entity3			1
@entity125 : bloody clashes around @entity3 presidential palace that fact , itself , is n't surprising			0
@entity2 previously defended the edict as necessary to defend the revolution and his administration has insisted the proposed constitution was drafted legally and the referendum will go on as planned			1
if people vote it down , the president said thursday night that he 'd form a new assembly to draft another constitution			2
yet opposition activists have n't shown any indication that they trust @entity2 on that or other counts			1
they accuse him of consolidating power for himself and the @entity33 , in part by having an @entity37 - dominated group push through the draft constitution			2
" this is not what we asked for , " one protester said			0
" it 's a complete dictatorship			0
" the @entity151 , an umbrella group of opposition groups , including @entity69 's @entity153 , promised their fight is not over , calling for more mass protests friday and claiming authorities " lost legitimacy , " said the group , according to the semi-official al - ahram newspaper			1
these demonstrations would follow heated protests thursday , including about 65 kilometers ( 40 miles ) north of @entity0 where a crowd tried to storm @entity2 's home , according to the @entity164			1
police fired tear gas to disperse the group , and at least 20 protesters and six police officers were injured			0
police arrested eight suspects carrying swords and clubs , the ministry said			0
@entity2 was not at the home at the time			2

the scene was calm , but tense , outside the presidential palace in the capital , where the military parked tanks and armored personnel carriers , put up barbed - wire barricades and deployed soldiers			0
in what looked like a war zone , piles of rubble and burned cars littered the streets and doors of nearby storefronts were smashed in			0
@entity2 also suffered a hit closer to home thursday when @entity202 , the deputy head of the @entity56 , resigned , party spokesman @entity203 said			1
@entity202 did not give a reason			0
his resignation brings to five the number of presidential advisers who have left in the last two days			0
it is the first , however , from the @entity56			0

and 11 organizations representing lawyers , journalists , writers , actors , musicians and tour guides said @entity2 and the @entity33 were behind the violence , @entity216 reported			1
the group said it would call for @entity2 's ouster if the administration failed to protect protesters and " fulfill the aspirations of the january 25 revolution , " the newspaper said			1
vice president @entity232 asked critics wednesday to submit their proposals for improving the constitution , and @entity2 invited political opponents to a meeting saturday at the president palace			1
but @entity2 has n't said he 's ready to alter the constitution or the planned referendum date			1
and some @entity33 officials have been more steadfast , as well as derogatory toward the opposition			0
@entity33 secretary - general @entity243 said thusday protesters were n't interested in democracy			0
he accused them of using " crude and contemptible ways of expression , rather than ( putting ) their points across in a civilized manner			0
" while insisting he respects @entity3 ' right to peaceful protest , @entity2 spent a significant portion of his thursday night speech blasting those he claims are behind the recent violence			1
he accused unspecified foreign and domestic sources of funding and fomenting the unrest , making specific reference to " corrupt " opposing forces tied to @entity59 's government			0
" the deposed @entity59 regime will not be brought back to life under any circumstances , " @entity2 said , tweeted the @entity33			2
