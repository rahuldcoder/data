five years after the financial crisis , the debate over whether some of the biggest banks in @entity3 are " too big to jail " is causing tensions among prosecutors and regulators			1
as federal prosecutors in @entity11 finalized their investigation of @entity13 for failing to blow the whistle on ponzi - schemer @entity15 , the question arose : what happens if federal prosecutors file criminal charges against the bank ? the answer was stark at a meeting in recent weeks in @entity21 between prosecutors and the bank 's chief regulator , the @entity25			1
prosecutors asked for assurance that charging the bank would n't lead to regulators starting proceedings to revoke the bank 's charter , according to people familiar with the discussions			1
prosecutors thought forcing the bank to accept a guilty plea could serve as a deterrent			2
but they also feared that if regulators moved to pull the bank 's license , it could lead to destruction of the nation 's largest bank and potentially the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs			1
@entity25 officials said they could provide no such assurance , the people familiar with the discussions said			0
on tuesday , @entity3 attorney @entity50 announced a deferred prosecution agreement with @entity13 , under which the bank would pay $ 1.7 billion in restitution to victims of the @entity15 fraud			1
the bank agreed to improve its anti-money laundering practices and other changes over the next two years to avoid facing criminal charges			1
@entity60 : @entity13 's expensive @entity15 reckoning @entity25 officials also announced a settlement with the bank , levying a $ 350 million penalty -- money which goes to the @entity66			1
the regulator also ordered the bank to improve its internal programs that are supposed to flag suspicious transactions			0
@entity72 , an @entity25 spokesman , said , " i ca n't comment on discussions between agency officials			0
" spokesman for the @entity3 attorney for @entity78 's @entity77 declined to comment			0
tensions between regulators and prosecutors prosecutors complain that when they push for tougher penalties , regulators warn of consequences that could mean damage to the @entity3 economy			2
regulators say they are required by @entity3 law to pull banking licenses if banks are convicted of criminal charges			1
@entity72 said tuesday that federal law requires the regulator to initiate proceedings that could lead to revoking banking charter if a bank is convicted of banking law violations			0
" @entity97 independently decides whether to pursue criminal charges and prosecution against a bank for criminal violations of [ money - laundering ] statutes			1
the @entity25 does not make recommendations regarding criminal prosecution			0
" at the same time , there 's public clamor for consequences against big banks blamed for reckless practices that led to the global financial crisis from which much of the world is still recovering			2
the result is that highly profitable banks pay large settlements and move on			0
@entity13 alone is the subject of up to a dozen investigations by federal prosecutors			1
an official close to the discussions said the result is a " conundrum where bad guys get away " with crimes			0
attorney general @entity125 , in a moment of candor at a 2013 congressional hearing , said , " i am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute , if you do bring a criminal charge , it will have a negative impact on the national economy , perhaps even the world economy			0
" after much criticism , he returned months later to another hearing and said he was n't implying that some banks are too big to prosecute : " let me make it very clear that there is no bank , there 's no institution , there 's no individual , who can not be investigated and prosecuted by the @entity97			1
" criticism for settling cases @entity125 's department came under criticism in 2012 when it settled for $ 1.9 billion in an investigation of @entity156 banking giant @entity155 , which for years allowed drug cartels and countries subject to sanctions to launder money			0
the tension between regulators and prosecutors showed at a news conference in @entity165 in which then - assistant attorney general @entity166 spoke of fears of collateral damage to the @entity3 economy as the reason for not charging @entity155			2
@entity171 , head of the @entity25 , told reporters his agency could n't be tougher on @entity155 because prosecutors were n't going after the bank			2
at tuesday 's news conference on the @entity178 settlement , @entity50 again took tough questions from reporters on why there was n't a tougher stance against the bank and its bankers			2
" you have to consider consequences such as employees being laid off , the bank failing			0
... you have to consider consequences such as innocent shareholders losing substantial value			0
you have to consider the possibility that regulators will take action against the charter of the financial institution , " @entity50 said			0
@entity60 : how @entity13 shorted @entity15 opinion : are banks really too big to jail ?			1
