-- despite food safety measures , the threat of foodborne illness remains in meat and produce -- and some types of illness are on the rise , recent reports say			1
about 48 million people contract some form of food poisoning each year , according to the @entity12			1
@entity13 remained the top cause of foodborne illness last year , according to the @entity12 's 2012 report card on food poisoning , issued thursday			1
however , the overall instance of @entity13 was unchanged from the 2006 - 08 data , the agency said			0
the report card is based on reports from 10 @entity24 regions , representing about 15 % of the country			0
the second most common cause of illness was @entity28 , which increased 14 % over the 2006 - 08 data , the @entity12 said			1
@entity28 lives on live chickens and can taint meat during slaughter ; it can also be found in raw , unpasteurized milk			1
chicken and ground beef top a list of " risky meat " published tuesday by the @entity37			1
researchers from this advocacy group examined data from foodborne illness outbreaks over a 12 - year period and found between 1998 and 2010 , meat and poultry products were linked to " at least 1,714 outbreaks involving 33,372 illnesses			1
" that estimate may only be the tip of the iceberg , the group said , as people may not seek medical attention for food poisoning and cases go unrecorded			2
the @entity24 @entity55 ( @entity55 ) has an online reporting tool for those who think they might have a foodborne illness			1
" we applaud @entity37 's ongoing efforts to educate consumers about food safety , " dr. @entity60 , the @entity55 's undersecretary for food safety , said in a statement responding to the report			2
" while we have made progress in making food safer -- including cutting @entity70 - related illnesses in half -- we still have work to do			2
as @entity13 rates continue to stagnate , we look forward to @entity37 's support , and the support of other groups committed to food safety , of our efforts to reduce this dangerous foodborne pathogen , including modernization of the poultry inspection system			1
" in addition , the @entity82 last week published an analysis of existing data on antibiotic - resistant bacteria contained in meat sold in supermarkets			0
eighty - one percent of ground chicken , 69 % of pork chops , 55 % of ground beef and 39 % of chicken were found to contain the bacteria , the organization reported , citing data from a february @entity97 report			1
antibiotic resistance reduces doctors ' options to treat you if you become ill. what government tests found in your meat on monday , the @entity82 published the latest version of its " dirty dozen " fruits and vegetables			2
the advocacy group describes it as a consumer shoppers ' guide to determine which types of produce pose the highest threat of pesticides			0
although pesticides are not a cause of foodborne illness , produce can be a source of food poisoning			1
in 2012 , cantaloupes , spinach and spring mix salad and mangoes were linked to outbreaks			0
improving food safety begins before the products ever reach the consumer , at the slaughterhouse and in the fields , but " being careful in the kitchen is also very important , " said dr. @entity132 , deputy director of the @entity12 's @entity133			1
so what 's a consumer to do ? at the store a @entity12 study published in 2010 once again highlighted the fact that young children can be exposed to raw meat and poultry products while riding in shopping carts , particularly if they ride in the basket of the cart			1
researchers suggest that parents keep their child away from these products , which could be leaking juices carrying bacteria , by placing their child in the cart 's seat , and not place meat or poultry products in the seat while shopping to avoid contamination			2
all consumers can benefit from separating their raw meat , poultry and seafood purchases from other food products to prevent cross-contamination			2
the @entity55 recommends placing these types of foods in plastic bags and also placing these purchases in separate shopping bags at checkout			0
storage packaging meat products in leak - proof containers would also help cut cross-contamination			0
@entity177 , for instance , saw a significant reduction in foodborne illness after mandating leak - proof packaging , @entity132 said			1
when you get home , storing raw meats in a plastic bag or container to prevent any juices from dripping on other foods is also important			0
listeria monocytogenes , another type of illness - causing bacteria , can grow in foods in the refrigerator , according to the @entity12			1
use an appliance thermometer to check the temperature inside the fridge ; it should be 40 degrees or lower , and the freezer should be 0 degrees or lower			0
food preparation start with clean hands			1
wash with soap and water for 20 seconds ( sing " @entity207 " twice ) before and after handling food -- and after other activities , such as changing diapers or using the bathroom			0
ideally , use separate cutting boards for fruits and vegetables and raw meat to avoid cross-contamination			2
wash fruits and vegetables under running water			0
scrubbing melons and cucumbers with a clean brush is recommended ; using soap to clean them is not			0
some home cooks wash their meat under running water before cooking , but , experts say , that can spread contaminated juices in places that may not be visible			0
use hot , soapy water to clean utensils and cutting boards after preparing foods ; use hot , soapy water and paper towels or clean towels to clean work surfaces			0
proper cooking is essential for meat , poultry and seafood			2
cooking temperatures have to reach a certain temperature to destroy bacteria such as @entity243 and @entity13 ; a meat thermometer is the only way to be sure those temperatures have been reached			0
a thermometer should be placed in the thickest part of the meat without touching the bone			0
ground beef , lamb and poultry should be cooked to 160 degrees @entity254 ; whole chickens , turkeys and poultry parts to 165 degrees ; and whole cuts of meat - like steaks , chops and roasts to 145 degrees , followed by three minutes of rest time before carving or eating			1
storing leftovers harmful bacteria can start growing at room temperature , so any leftovers should go into the fridge or freezer within two hours of cooking			0
storage times for the fridge and freezer can vary depending on the food .			0

meat , fruit and vegetables can all pose a risk of foodborne illness
cases of @entity28 illness are on the rise , according to the @entity12
