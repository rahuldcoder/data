way to make us weep , @entity2			1
as if she did n't smash 2014 enough with a blockbuster album and dominance of the headlines , @entity2 had one final gift for the world on december 31			1
the superstar posted a video of her gift - giving to fans , which has become known as " @entity13			0
" here 's how it worked : after the successful release of her " 1989 " album , @entity2 did some " @entity2 - lurking , " in which she followed some fans on social media , taking in personal details including likes and dislikes			1
the video features the singer wrapping gifts for some of her fans and shipping them to the adoring bunch			1
in one case , @entity2 personally travels to @entity29 to deliver gifts to the young son of one adoring fan			2
as you can imagine , there are squeals , tears and total meltdowns over the generosity of a celeb who has become known for breaking down the wall of fame ( she famously hosted tons of them in her various homes for private listening parties before to the release of her new album )			2
so cheers to you , @entity2			0
