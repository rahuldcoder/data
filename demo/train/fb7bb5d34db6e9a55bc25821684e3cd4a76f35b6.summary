@entity0 -- the @entity3 jet that skidded down a @entity5 airport runway on its nose on monday touched down on its front wheels first , which then collapsed , according to federal accident investigators			1
the unusual landing , in which investigators said the plane 's nose pitched down seconds before touchdown , is the surest clue yet to explain the accident involving the @entity16 that injured several people			1
the @entity18 said on thursday that video and other sources provide evidence that the nose gear contacted the tarmac before the main wheels			1
under a normal landing in a big jet , the main landing gear under each wing would touch the runway first and simultaneously -- absorbing the main stress of landing -- and the nose gear then lowered gradually as the plane decelerates down the runway			1
that model jet is expected to cross the runway threshold at about 140 knots or 161 mph , according to @entity16 figures			1
investigators said the pilot evidently adjusted the wing flaps less than a minute before landing , suggesting to veteran pilots who spoke with @entity1 that the plane may not have been on a stabilized approach as it neared the runway			1
landing the way it did " would potentially have overstressed the nose gear to the point where it would have failed , " said capt. @entity51 , a former 737 pilot and civil aviation leader at @entity53 in @entity0			1
the @entity18 said the flaps were set from 30 to 40 degrees about 56 seconds prior to touchdown			0
" what this brings into question is whether they were on a stabilized approach to make a normal landing , " @entity51 said			0
the safety board , coincidentally , is looking at whether @entity62 124 , which crashed - landed in @entity63 earlier this month , was also on a stabilized approach			0
details released late thursday about the @entity67 accident show the plane changing its pitch suddenly in the final seconds of flight -- and in a direction opposite than desired			2
when the plane was just 32 feet in altitude , four seconds before landing , the plane was pitched 2 degrees nose up			2
at touchdown , the plane was pitched approximately 3 degrees nose down , the safety board said			0
video shows the plane careening down the runway , the nose to the pavement , sending up showers of sparks			2
after touchdown , the aircraft came to a stop within approximately 19 seconds , the @entity18 reported			2
@entity3 said in a statement that the landing scenario the @entity18 describes from video and other sources " is not in accordance with our operating procedures			0
" word that the landing was unusual could remove suspicion of a mechanical failure			0
such a conclusion could have major implications for commercial aviation worldwide , given the 737 's status as the most widely used commercial jet			0
the company operates only 737s and has more than 600 in its fleet .			0
