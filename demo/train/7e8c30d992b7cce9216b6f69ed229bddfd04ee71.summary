-- perched on a sofa in her @entity4 apartment , @entity1 recounts early memories of her son @entity6			1
disciplining him , it seems , was delicate business			1
" he was like a ball of fire as a little boy , " the 90 - year - old told me			1
you did n't want to pull the reins too hard and spoil him , spoil his adventures and his madness but you had to pull a little bit			2
" his single - mindedness began to reveal itself when he was just three or four , she recalls			1
@entity27 ran off and hid at a local farmer 's house after a strong reprimand			1
" eventually someone rang to say ' we 've got a little blue - eyed boy here ? does he belong to you ? ' @entity36 was i relieved			1
" now , her son has a knighthood , is worth more than $ 5 billion according to @entity40 and is one of the world 's most able -- if eccentric -- entrepreneurs			1
but what was the secret to such success ? does tough love breed success or is support and encouragement key to raising tomorrow 's tycoons ? i set out to answer these questions in a series of interviews with the mothers of sports stars , tech pioneers and rockers and discovered they had many traits in common			1
@entity27 , it seems , was not the only budding businessman with a mind of his own			2
@entity63 , mum of @entity66 magnate @entity64 , has a similar story			1
the @entity69 model and nutritionist laughs nervously as she recalls the time she left a young @entity72 behind at home for misbehaving while taking her other children to visit their cousins			2
it was a 20 minute drive away or four hours on foot , she says			2
just as she was leaving @entity72 says her son turned up out of nowhere			2
" i saw this tiny little boy , just past toddler stage , coming down the sidewalk			2
he 'd walked there ! i was horrified			2
" now aged 42 , her son has revolutionized the world of e-commerce and electric vehicles through his companies @entity66 and @entity87			1
and just like @entity27 , who soon aims to make passenger space travel a possibility , @entity72 is taking on the final frontier : with a contract from @entity92 for his firm @entity93 to transport orbital cargo			0
@entity63 says her each launch leaves her " anxious and shaking and sick , " with relief finally coming with success			1
it 's a reaction @entity99 can sympathize with			1
@entity100 has raised two successful children , both of whom hold @entity105 titles			1
older son @entity106 is a doubles champion while her youngest is the singles title holder @entity109			0
when @entity100 clinched the @entity105 title last year , the first @entity111 to do so in 77 years , his mother could n't look			0
" i buried my face because i knew the cameras would be on me			0
" @entity100 , herself an accomplished tennis player and coach , introduced her sons to the sport as a way of keeping them busy , but never expected her family name to make the sport 's hall of fame			1
" as eight and nine year olds they were exceptionally good tennis players ... but when i saw @entity109 holding the trophy , i just thought " i ca n't believe it , " she says			0
@entity99 has been accused of being pushy but says people " make assumptions because they do n't know me			1
" i 've heard @entity109 and @entity106 being asked that before and they say ' my mum never pushed us			1
' that 's why they are still doing what they are doing , because they love what they are doing			1
" another famous son inspired by his parent 's passion is @entity144 , the inventor of the @entity145			2
the child of two computer programmers and maths aficionados , @entity144 grew up in a household of calculus before bedtime			2
his 90 - year - old mother @entity152 shows me a sketch drawn by a family friend on holiday one year depicting a young @entity144 and three siblings in animated conversation ; the word " noise " scribbled above their heads			1
" i used to think my children were terribly well behaved but when i look back at this i realize it was n't always so , " she says			0
she recalls evenings around the dinner table , when the family would try and solve maths problems			0
if his parents were unable to crack it , @entity144 would step in , she told me			0
" it was all terribly good fun			0
" but good mothers do n't always choose the conventional path : @entity174 , who raised her three kids while on tour with the @entity177 , felt it important to educate them on life as a rocker 's offspring			1
describing the moment she offered her son and daughter cocaine and cannabis , respectively , @entity174 says she felt " like a lioness showing her cubs the world and what was out there			2
" did that make her a bad mother ? " luckily it did n't backfire , " she says			0
now a grandmother , @entity196 has fond memories of the days she spent on the road with her family and the @entity177			2
" i used to love it			0
we 'd just pack up and it was like we were all going on an adventure			0
" and in many ways @entity196 was a mother figure to the whole band			0
" i loved @entity211 for his wonderful cold sense of humor , and of course i loved @entity215 , @entity210 has a special place in my heart and @entity218 , you never know where you stand with him			0
one minute he can be fabulous and then next he 'll ignore you			0
" @entity196 credits her kids , art dealer @entity222 , singer @entity223 and youngest son @entity225 , with helping her through the breakdown of her marriage			0
she is now runs her own beauty brand and says " my kids kept me sane through all of my hard times , " she says			0
" they 'd call me up and make sure i was n't alone			0
they 'd take me clubbing			0
and just like the other famous mothers i met she concludes : " my kids are great			0
i know i would n't be the same without them			0
