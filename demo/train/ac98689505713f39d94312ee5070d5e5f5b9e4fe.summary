@entity0 was shocked the second she saw it : a light - bulb glowing in the middle of a room with no wires attached			1
looking back , it was a crude experiment , she remembers : a tiny room filled with gigantic copper refrigerator coils -- the kind you 'd see if you cracked open the back of your freezer			0
she walked in and out between the coils and the bulb -- and still the bulb glowed			0
" i said : ' let 's work on this			0
' " what 's the trick ? " we 're going to transfer power without any kind of wires , " says dr @entity0 , now chief technology officer at @entity23 , a startup developing wireless " resonance " technology			1
" but , we 're not actually putting electricity in the air			0
what we 're doing is putting a magnetic field in the air			0
" it works like this : @entity23 builds a " @entity39 , " a coil of electrical wire that generates a magnetic field when power is attached			2
if another coil is brought close , an electrical charge can be generated in it			0
" when you bring a device into that magnetic field , it induces a current in the device , and by that you 're able to transfer power , " explains dr hall			1
and like that , the bulb lights up			0
wireless homes do n't worry about getting zapped : @entity0 assures that the magnetic fields used to transfer energy are " perfectly safe " -- in fact , they are the same kind of fields used in @entity65 routers			1
in the house of the future , wire - free energy transfer could be as easy as wireless internet			1
if all goes to @entity23 's plans , smartphones will charge in your pocket as you wander around , televisions will flicker with no wires attached , and electric cars will refuel while sitting on the driveway			2
@entity23 has already demonstrated the ability to power laptops , cell - phones , and tvs by attaching resonator coils to batteries -- and an electric car refueler is reportedly in the works			2
@entity0 sees a bright future for the family without wires : " we just do n't think about it anymore : i 'm going to drive my car home and i 'm never going to have to go to the gas station and i 'm never going to have to plug it in			1
" i ca n't even imagine how things will change when we live like that			0
" world outside beyond these effort - saving applications , @entity0 sees more revolutionary steps			1
when @entity0 first saw the wireless bulb , she immediately thought of medical technology -- seeing that devices transplanted beneath the skin could be charged non-intrusively			1
@entity23 is now working with a medical company to recharge a left - ventricular assist device -- " a heart - pump , essentially			2
" the technology opens the door to any number of mobile electronic devices which have so far been held back by limited battery lives			1
" the idea of eliminating cables would allow us to re-design things in ways that we have n't yet thought of , that 's just going to make our devices and everything that we interact with , that much more efficient , more practical and maybe even give brand new functionality			1
" what 's next ? the challenge now is increasing the distance that power can be transferred efficiently			2
this distance -- @entity0 explains -- is linked to the size of the coil , and @entity23 wants to perfect the same long - distance transfers to today 's small - scale devices			1
for this reason , the team have high hopes for their new creation : aa - sized wirelessly rechargeable batteries			0
for @entity0 , the applications are endless : " i always say kids will say : ' why is it called wireless ? ' " " the kids that are growing up in a couple of years will never have to plug anything in again to charge it			1
" * update ( march 17 ) it 's great to see so much discussion of this technology on social media and the comments thread			2
there seems to be a lot of interest in the contribution of @entity154 's experiments to the development of this technology			0
dr @entity0 discussed @entity154 briefly in her interview with @entity158 : @entity158 : given that @entity154 and others realized all this over a century ago , why 's it taken so long ? dr hall : i do n't think they realized exactly what we 've done			1
they were certainly dreaming of wireless power -- there 's no question about that			1
in those days , it was a different problem , because they were really thinking about : how do they get the power from where it 's generated to where it 's used			0
and in that case they might have been thinking about @entity180 generating the power and getting it to @entity182 -- and that 's a long distance			0
we 're not proposing that the technology we have here at @entity23 would be used for that kind of application			0
when we came around , power 's already being transferred by wires to homes and rooms and things of that nature , so we had a much different problem , which was really just this much shorter distance			2
as @entity23 has mentioned on its website , its @entity196 technology is also distinct from @entity154 's creations -- and is efficient enough to be economically viable .			0

dr @entity0 is developing ways to transfer power without wires
in the home of the future , wireless energy will be as common as @entity65 , she believes
the technology could lead to new and revolutionary medical devices
