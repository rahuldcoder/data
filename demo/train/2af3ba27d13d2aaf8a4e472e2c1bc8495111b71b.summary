-- he grew up constantly on the move , the son of parents who were in the theater business in @entity6			2
his mother and his stepfather say from an early age , @entity7 has been driven by a sense of fighting for justice			1
now , that battle applies to himself as well			2
@entity7 , the 40 - year - old founder and public face of the website @entity16 , lost his battle wednesday to stay in the @entity19 and avoid extradition to @entity21 to face questioning over sex charges			1
" i have not been charged with any crime in any country , " @entity7 noted			1
it 's the latest turn in a saga that has kept the often elusive , enigmatic figure in the international spotlight			2
since the summer of 2010 , when @entity16 began releasing reams of classified @entity32 intelligence documents , @entity7 has stoked the ire of top officials in the @entity32 and around the world			1
some want him and @entity16 punished for what they call irreparable damage to global security			1
" @entity16 has ... ignored our requests not to release or disseminate any @entity32 documents it may possess and has continued its well - established pattern of irresponsible , reckless , and frankly dangerous actions , " @entity42 spokesman @entity41 said in september			1
supporters contend @entity7 represents free speech at its finest			1
they say he is committed to outing injustices			2
@entity7 himself has remained stalwart that the information @entity16 chooses to release serves the public by exposing truths about secretive government decisions			1
days ago , when @entity16 announced it was temporarily stopping publication to raise funds in order to stay afloat in the wake of a financial blockade by banks , @entity7 said , " if this financial attack stands unchallenged , a dangerous , oppressive and undemocratic precedent will have been set , the implications of which go far beyond @entity16 and its work			1
" his parents see the makings of his persona in his youth			2
his mother , @entity74 , describes him as " highly intelligent			2
" he was just 16 when she bought him a @entity76 computer			0
it was 1987 , and there were no websites			0
@entity7 attached a modem to his computer and began his journey through the growing world of computer networks			1
" it 's like chess , " he once told @entity86 magazine			2
" chess is very austere in that you do n't have many rules , there is no randomness and the problem is very hard			0
" though his mother raised him without any religious influence , she sensed that from a tender age , her son was led by a strong desire to do what he perceived as just			2
" he was a lovely boy , very sensitive , good with animals , quiet and has a wicked sense of humor , " she told the @entity104 , @entity6 , @entity103 newspaper last year			0
@entity108 , who raised @entity7 from age one and gave him his surname , says he was " a very bright boy with a keen sense of right and wrong			1
" in an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity115 last year , he described his stepson as a " sharp kid who always fought for the underdog			2
" " strangely enough , i always thought he would do something like this , " @entity108 said			0
" he was always very independent			0
and he certainly would n't take ' no ' for an answer			0
" he always stood up for the underdog			1
i remember that , like with his school friends			0
he was always very angry about people ganging up on other people			0
he had a really good sense of equality and equity			0
" @entity7 would go on to study mathematics and physics at the @entity133			1
in interviews , his scientific precision shines through			0
in a baritone voice , he speaks in measured pace , choosing each word carefully			0
he can be charming yet cagey about his private life and is rarely shaken by discussions of even the most controversial revelations on @entity16			1
he displays a broad range of interests , from computers to literature to his travels in @entity147			0
he 's the kind of person who , he says , can hack into the most sophisticated computer system , but forget to show up for an interview , or cancel at the last minute			2
even when he walked out of a @entity0 interview last year after refusing to answer questions about the sex charges in @entity21 , @entity7 remained cool and collected			1
he projected a stately demeanor helped by his profusion of gray hair -- which grew at an early age -- and an equally steely facial expression			0
after his initial foray into computers as a teen , @entity7 delved into computer encryption and grew keen on computer security			1
he once relayed a story about how he set up an encryption puzzle based on the manipulation of prime numbers			0
the @entity86 article , published last year , described how in 1991 , @entity7 hacked into the master terminal of the telecom company @entity172 , after which he developed a growing fear of arrest			1
he had married and fathered a child when he was only 18 , but the relationship fell apart and his wife left him , taking their infant son with her			0
he was charged with 31 counts of hacking in @entity6 but in the end paid only a small sum in damages , according to the @entity86			0
the young hacker began to focus his attention away from network flaws to what he perceived as wrongdoings of governments			0
in a 2007 blog post on @entity192 , he wrote : " the whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent , but try as i may i can not escape the sound of suffering			0
perhaps as an old man i will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance			0
but not now ; men in their prime , if they have convictions are tasked to act on them			0
" @entity192 is believed to be a blog created by @entity7 and is registered under the name " ja " by the same @entity32 domain company as @entity16			1
its @entity6 postal address is also the same as a submissions address for @entity16			1
driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist , @entity7 founded @entity16 in 2006			1
he slept little and sometimes forgot to eat			0
he hired staff and enlisted the help of volunteers			0
always , he protected his sources , never discussing where information came from			0
" people should understand that @entity16 has proven to be arguably the most trustworthy new source that exists , because we publish primary source material and analysis based on that primary source material , " @entity7 told @entity0			1
" other organizations , with some exceptions , simply are not trustworthy			0
" @entity230 , a longtime volunteer and spokesman for @entity16 who quit his job last year , told @entity0 that @entity7 's personality was distracting from the group 's original mission : to publish small leaks , not just huge , splashy ones like the @entity238			1
" it is my role to be the lightning rod , " @entity7 said			1
" that is a difficult role			2
on the other hand , i get undue credit			0
" @entity7 's mother told the @entity103 that she feared her son had become " too smart for himself			1
" " i 'm concerned it 's gotten too big and the forces that he 's challenging are too big , " she said			1
@entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , and @entity258 contributed to this report .			2

" he always stood up for the underdog , " @entity7 's stepfather says
@entity7 's mother said she was concerned he had become " too smart for himself "
the @entity42 recently *slammed* @entity16 's " pattern of irresponsible , " dangerous actions
@entity7 : " it is my role to be the lightning rod "
