-- a days - long outage for some @entity3 e-mail users is casting a dark shadow over a perceived turnaround at the once - mighty @entity7 player			1
some users of @entity9 , which underwent a major overhaul over the summer , were still without service thursday from an outage that started late monday			1
the downtime was due to " a hardware problem in our of our mail data centers " and proved " harder to fix than we originally expected , " @entity15 , who heads up e-mail services for @entity3 , said in a blog post			1
late wednesday , the company posted that the affected servers were up and running , but that it would take time to catch up on missed e-mails and that some users would still have trouble accessing their accounts			1
the post said it expected all lagged e-mails to be delivered by thursday afternoon			0
ceo @entity30 made revamping e-mail a part of her effort to kickstart a web company that , in the eyes of many , had grown stale and was bleeding money			1
it 's been a rocky process			0
announced last december , the first e-mail overhaul rolled out to all users ( whether they wanted it or not ) in june			2
so lukewarm was the reception that it got a largely cosmetic redesign again in october			0
the result ? more outrage			0
under @entity46 , @entity3 purchased @entity15 's company , @entity47 , in july , and the former @entity3 staffer was put in charge of the redesign			1
but it 's suffered from periodic outages since october , the latest being the most dramatic			0
@entity52 , of tech blog @entity53 , wrote a scathing piece tackling recurring problems with @entity9 and the company 's response			2
" while i am certain @entity15 -- for whom i have had great respect for a long time -- and his team are trying their best to fix the problem , the contrast to @entity3 ceo @entity30 's insistence on engineering excellence and innovation and the inability of the company to provide a cogent explanation about what is happening to one of its most important daily interfaces with its customers could not be any more stark , " she wrote			1
" in other words : what could be bigger than a @entity77 ? this			0
" rank - and - file users were no happier , based on social media posts about the outage			2
" update 10 hours old , account still not accessible by phone			0
your ' help ' said to reinstall it , but account not available for that , " one @entity83 user wrote to @entity3 's mail team account thursday morning			2
" a freakin nightmare ; you guys work for @entity94 healthcare ? " wrote another			0
since @entity46 took over in june 2012 , there have been signs of life at the company			0
stock prices have jumped 130 % as she orchestrated a logo redesign , several high - profile acquisitions -- most notably @entity103 -- and overhauls of apps , including e-mail			0
but @entity107 and @entity108 continue to chip away at @entity3 's biggest moneymaker , online advertising , and revenue has been flat			2
a black eye for something as simple as an e-mail outage , and a response viewed as lackluster by some , is the last thing a company on the rebound wants or needs			1
" the issue is n't that @entity3 's webmail has gone down â € ” in fact , from time to time it is to be expected , " @entity121 wrote for tech blog @entity122			1
" but when one of a company 's core services , especially the one that ceo @entity132 identified as the linchpin to the success of @entity3 , experiences issues , users expect to be informed regularly			1
the company must be transparent about outages , or risk ruining the reputation it has worked so hard to rebuild			0

@entity3 e-mail outage has lasted since late monday for some
company says server issue is fixed , *messages* are catching up
ceo @entity30 has made overhauling e-mail a priority
but *vocal* users have n't liked some of the changes
