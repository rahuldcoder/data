-- @entity1 put the disappointments of @entity3 behind her on friday with an impressive run in the first free practice session ahead of sunday 's @entity7 @entity6			1
the @entity9 development driver only managed four laps during practice at the @entity12 @entity6 a fortnight ago before engine problems curtailed her involvement			1

@entity1 has been a development driver for @entity9 since 2012 and is the first female driver to participate in a @entity35 race weekend since @entity37 's @entity36 attempted to qualify for three races during the 1992 season			1
@entity42 , speaking ahead of his recent victory at @entity3 , said @entity1 's participation at two practice sessions this season was fully deserved			2
" she 's very , very talented , " said the @entity47 driver , who raced against her in his junior career in karting and @entity51			0
" it 's really cool to see her in a @entity35 car			0
