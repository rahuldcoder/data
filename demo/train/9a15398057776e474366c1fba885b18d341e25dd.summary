-- @entity1 does n't think it got too terribly cold during the two days she was stranded on @entity5 's @entity4 volcano			1
" i think about 28 degrees was the lowest we saw -- but then the temperature gauge was frozen , " she said saturday evening from @entity6 , @entity5			1
thanks to sleeping bags , waterproof gear and emergency supplies , @entity14 , a fellow researcher and a pilot survived unharmed in their iced - over helicopter from wednesday until a rescue chopper scooped them up friday			1
pilot @entity19 took @entity20 , a geophysicist with the @entity22 , and @entity14 , a post-doctoral researcher , about 6,500 feet up the volcano on wednesday			1
the researchers were picking up instruments to save them from the upcoming winter			1
their work is aimed at learning how seismic readings are linked to the underlying causes of earthquakes			1
some volcanic earthquakes quakes are caused by moving magma , water or gas , @entity14 said			1
knowing which substance is moving could help assess the risk of eruptions , she said			1
the trio took advantage of a break in the weather wednesday to land at their highest instrument site on @entity46			2
" there were blue skies when we landed , " she said			2
but within half an hour , @entity19 told the researchers he was concerned about ice on the rotors			2
" we grabbed our stuff and got in the helicopter , " @entity14 said , but even in the few minutes that took visibility became too poor for takeoff			2
@entity19 could call for help by satellite phone and radio , but the weather prevented a rescue attempt on wednesday			2
on thursday , rescuers circled overhead but could not land			0
meanwhile , the three stayed in sleeping bags inside the helicopter except to answer nature 's calls and shoot a flare at the request of the rescuers			1
there was enough food and water on board			0
" even though it was n't that cold , it was pretty foul when you were outside , " @entity14 said			0
@entity14 , 33 , grew up in @entity79 , @entity80 , and has spent time on mountains in @entity83 and @entity5 , so she was prepared for the cold			0
but she was grateful for @entity20 and @entity86 's decades of experience in the field			0
" i felt really luck to be with those people , " @entity14 said			0
" i know they kept us all alive			0
" she also praised the @entity94 , which rescued her			1
" it was such a relief hearing them up there even when they could n't get in , " she said			0
@entity20 was n't available to talk saturday -- because he was back out on the mountain			0
@entity14 said he hoped to check on the condition of the helicopter , where the researchers had to leave their instruments .			0
