@entity0 -- a self - styled truth teller with a penchant for political combat -- was notably cautious wednesday when pressed on president @entity5 's plan to issue immigration executive orders			1
at the annual meeting of the @entity11 here , the @entity8 governor and potential 2016 presidential contender repeatedly avoided weighing on the @entity5 plan that could defer deportation for almost four million undocumented immigrants			1
@entity0 , the @entity11 's chairman , addressed reporters at the conference and basked in the glow his successful 2014 election cycle , proudly flanked by new governors - elect from the blue states of @entity21 and @entity22			1
but even as other @entity11 governors with @entity25 ambitions sharply attacked the president 's decision , @entity0 hedged on the hot - button issue when reporters broached the subject			1
" let 's wait to see what the president says tomorrow night before we have any kind of reaction to that , " @entity0 said when asked about the immigration announcement			1
he did express confidence that the new @entity11 leadership in @entity42 will avoid a government shutdown over the matter despite threats from hard - line conservatives			2
" all this kind of hysteria about shutdown to me is just people wanting to make news , " @entity0 said			2
" i have confidence in the speaker , i have confidence in @entity56 that they 'll do this the right way and run the government			0
" later , asked if he would repeal @entity5 's executive actions on immigration if he were elected president , he punted again , saying that questions about a hypothetical candidacy were irrelevant			1
" i am not going to articulate the basis of a yet unknown candidacy , " he said			0
@entity0 instead turned the focus back to @entity8 where , he said , " we 've been dealing with this stuff already , because of the president 's unwillingness to deal with this issue			2
" he pointed to a version of the @entity77 he signed last year granting tuition breaks to children of undocumented workers — a bill that rankled some conservative activists in early primary states like @entity84 and @entity85 — and flagged his opposition to driver 's licenses for illegal immigrants			0
other governors at the meeting , including several eyeing their own @entity25 bids , were more willing to condemn the president , often in blunt terms			0
@entity97 gov. @entity96 , said the president should sit down with congressional leaders and work on a piece meal approach to immigration reform			0
" i think it would be a profound mistake for the president to overturn @entity106 's immigration laws with a stroke of a pen , " he said			1
@entity110 gov. @entity109 called unilateral action a " mistake			0
" @entity114 gov. @entity113 called the move " illegal " and said the president is breaching @entity118 separation of powers			0
@entity121 gov. @entity120 also called the executive order unconstitutional			0
@entity5 is also putting his own party in jeopardy , he said			2
" i think he jeopardizes long term the @entity127 ability to ever get back into power in @entity129 , " @entity120 said			0
@entity131 gov. @entity130 said @entity42 could file suit and lake legal action against the president			0
there would be a " compelling " case to made against the president in the court system , he said			0
though his potential rivals might have been drawing a policy contrast with @entity0 ahead of next year 's primary , they and other @entity141 gushed over his political work atop the @entity11			1
@entity0 raised over $ 100 million to elect @entity141 governors in 2014 and even went into debt to help pull long - shot @entity11 candidate @entity148 over the finish line in deep - blue @entity22			1
" i want to thank gov. @entity0 for believing in us , and the @entity11 for coming to the rescue , " @entity148 told reporters			1
@entity153 , the governor - elect in @entity21 , called @entity0 " a relentless campaigner			2
" " i 've never seen anything like it , " he said			0
and @entity96 said " the country owes a debt of gratitude " to @entity0 for helping install 31 governors in state houses across the country , the most for either party in 16 years			2
" i speak on behalf of all the @entity11 governors , when i say thank you to gov. @entity0 for his extraordinary leadership , " @entity96 said			1
