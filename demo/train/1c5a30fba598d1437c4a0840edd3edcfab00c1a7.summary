" it 's 100 % we 're off ! a huge thanks to all , " tweeted @entity10 , an @entity7 professor among the group of scientists , journalists and tourists marooned on the ship			1
a helicopter from a nearby @entity19 icebreaker ferried passengers thursday to the @entity7 icebreaker , the @entity22			1
the rescue is the latest chapter in a saga that began @entity26 after the @entity28 - flagged @entity27 got stuck in unusually thick ice			1
officials abandoned a succession of other rescue attempts in recent days because of the treacherous conditions in the region			0

but the new approach , which skipped the use of the barge , got under way later in the day			0
@entity44 posted videos showing the helicopter arriving on a makeshift helipad on the ice near the trapped ship and taking off into the crisp blue sky			1
@entity51 , chief mate on the @entity22 , told @entity52 that the 52 new passengers on board were very happy to be there and kept thanking the icebreaker 's crew for their efforts			1
" they are on their second dinner of the night right now , " he said			0

" mid-january is our best guess , " @entity67 told reporters on a conference call			0
the @entity22 is still expected to complete a resupply mission to @entity74 , an @entity7 base in @entity3 , before making its way to @entity66			2
@entity51 said that now all the passengers are on the @entity22 , the vessel will try to move out of the heavy pack ice and into more open water			2
but , he said , they will not set off toward @entity74 until the @entity80 of @entity7 gives them the green light			2
@entity51 also thanked the captain of the @entity19 icebreaker whose help made the rescue possible			1
" thank you very much for your cooperation			0
your crew has done the lion 's share of the work and made @entity7 and much of the world proud , " he said			1
meanwhile , the master of the @entity27 has decided to keep the 22 @entity28 crew members on board the stranded ship until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows it to move again , @entity67 said			1
the vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for " a very long time , " he said			2
the helicopter rescue followed a failed attempt by the @entity19 icebreaker , the @entity105 , which made it 6 nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by especially thick ice			1
that was followed by an effort by the @entity7 icebreaker , which was forced monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather			1
the @entity22 got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back			0
over the weekend , the maritime agency called off an effort by the @entity118 icebreaker @entity117			0

the vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg			0
@entity44 , a climate change professor at the @entity171 , has said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet ( 3 meters ) thick .			2

chief mate : passengers are very happy now to be on the @entity7 icebreaker
he thanks @entity19 icebreaker crew whose helicopter ferried 52 to *safety*
