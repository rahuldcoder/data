-- it seems everyone knows a college degree is important but few have a plan to keep it affordable			2
just this past academic year , tuition went up twice as fast as inflation and the cost of textbooks rose faster than tuition			2
meanwhile , the @entity10 recently reported that " wages have fallen to a record low as a share of @entity15 's gross domestic product			2
" Â as a result , the average 2011 graduate left school with $ 26,600 in student loan debt , helping to push the country 's total student loan debt past $ 1 trillion			2
combine that with an unemployment rate for recent college graduates of 8.9 % , and you see the impetus behind the @entity28 question du jour -- " is college really worth it ? " that 's a question that is easily answered by the 23 % unemployment rate for folks without a bachelor 's			1
still , the threat of leaving school with crippling loan payments does bring up a more valid question : should students continue to take out huge loans to pursue majors that do n't have a clear path to paying that loan back ? in other words , a job ? in an ironic showing of big government , @entity46 gov. @entity45 and @entity48 gov. @entity47 , both conservatives , decided to introduce plans in which state institutions charge less for @entity54 degrees ( science , technology , engineering and math ) than liberal arts degrees			1
" we 're spending a lot of money on education , and when you look at the results , it 's not great , " @entity45 told a crowd in @entity61 in 2011			2
" do you want to use your tax money to educate more people who ca n't get jobs in anthropology ? i do n't			0
" Â Â that 's a pretty good zinger but it does n't pass the smell test			0
first of all -- to borrow language from the @entity78 script -- i do n't think the government should be picking winners and losers			1
and state officials massaging tuition costs to lure students away from fields they do n't approve of does just that			1
there is a difference between an education and training			0
just because the vocational outcome between the two might be different does n't mean it 's government 's role to assign its value to society			1
not to mention the initial outcomes are not always black and white			0
for example , recent college grads with a degree in architecture have a 13.9 % unemployment rate , while @entity103 literature majors had a 9.2 % rate , according to a study conducted by @entity107 's @entity106			1
the report also found that communication majors had a lower unemployment rate than mechanical engineers and computer science majors			1
recent information technology majors had a nearly 12 % rate			1
instead of coercing students into certain fields by saddling liberal arts with higher costs , @entity45 , @entity47 and others should concentrate on providing families with all the information they need to make informed decisions			1
during his @entity124 , president @entity123 announced he was launching @entity125 , a website that consolidates costs , student loan debt and other financial variables for each school to help families get " the most bang for your educational buck			1
" the information is useful but far from complete , according to @entity136 , vice president of @entity137			0
" they do n't tell you what percentage of the students at the school borrowed , " @entity136 told me			1
" so you can report a default rate at a particular school , but if you do n't put that rate in context , it can be misleading			2
" also , the median debt number includes those that graduated and students that dropped out			2
so schools with high drop out rates and high borrowing rates come out looking far worse than what they actually may be			0
" still , @entity136 credited the administration for giving parents a tool to help them make better decisions			0
the next step should be incorporating research on which majors offer the best opportunities for jobs , so if someone 's daughter or son wants a degree that does n't train for a specific job , they can see what they are getting into in the long term			2
parents can joke about liberal art majors and kids coming back home after college , but it 's an infringement on civil liberties for government to strong arm students into technical degrees by artificially manipulating costs			1
any official who 's concerned about higher education in this country should address the skyrocketing costs , not demonize degrees they do n't appreciate			1
that 's for parents like me to do			0
i was standing in a long @entity196 line recently and decided to strike up a conversation with a college student who said something rather interesting			0
" what 's your major ? " i asked			0
" tv , " she said			0
the student went on to tell me that part of her focus was studying the history of television programming			0
i kept smiling and nodding at the appropriate time all the while thinking " i sure hope her parents are rich			0
" normally i do n't believe anybody should be telling folks what to study			0
but even i must admit the thought of kids borrowing tens of thousands to get a degree in " @entity221 " may require some intervention			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

@entity46 , @entity48 governors want state colleges to charge less for stem degrees
@entity225 : government has no business deciding value of any subject to society
@entity225 : but recent grads fact a *jobless* rate of 8.9 % and huge costs
@entity225 : students should consider whether they can get a job to pay back loans
