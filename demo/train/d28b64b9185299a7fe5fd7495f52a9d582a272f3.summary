-- nobody wants to underwhelm when it comes to their final words on this planet			2
" @entity6 , toast me a bagel			2
" so if you knew the exact moment when you were going to die , you might put some serious thought into the matter and really nail it			1
of course , you 'd probably want to go out with something inspired and meaningful			2
or perhaps a dark , secret confession			2
maybe explain to your wife that , yes , you traded her stupid cat on @entity17 for a football phone			2
and , no , she ca n't have it when you 're gone			2
the football phone goes in the casket			0
and whatever beer 's in the fridge			0
it 's all a little weird to consider , but if having this mortal information appeals to you , there 's a popular new @entity30 campaign that delivers this gift of death			1
more specifically , a wristwatch that counts down to your very last moment			1
it also keeps regular time			1
because if you miss your appointment for erotic massage , there 's no refund			0
but its main job is still to remind you when you 'll die			1
the watch , appropriately called @entity52 , " counts down your life , in order to make the world a better place			1
" and it 's a heartwarming sentiment if you 're into that kind of thing			0
i 'm just not sure that if i suddenly knew i had 40 minutes to go , i 'd quickly drop everything , grab a shovel and plant a tree			0
truth be told , i 'd probably sit around the house , watch some @entity64 and wallow in self - doubt			1
but the idea is that you might go out and be a better person if you had a bit more advance warning			1
which is why @entity52 hopes to inspire people by reminding them that " death is non-negotiable " and , as the days slip away , it 's important to " make the right decisions			1
" " today i am not wearing pants ! " just be careful to make the " right decision " at home and not , say , @entity78			1
@entity52 comes from the mind of @entity82 who , after his grandfather passed away several years ago , was inspired to create the " death watch " in his honor			1
@entity82 said : " it made me think about death and the transience of life , and i realized that nothing matters when you are dead			1
instead what matters is what we do when we are alive			2
" i nap a lot			0
however , if you 're even slightly more motivated than i am , and if knowing your expiration date is something you 're into , setting up the @entity52 death watch will be fairly straightforward			1
you simply fill out a questionnaire with inquiries about smoking , exercise and general health			0
that creates a special number from which you then subtract your age			0
and there you have it : the exact number of years , months , days , hours , minutes and seconds until you take a big dirt nap			0
with apologies to the word " exact			0
" @entity52 is , perhaps , a bit odd , but it 'll definitely be a good conversation starter at the company holiday party			1
and that 's what @entity82 wants			0
" the occurrence of death is no surprise to anyone , but in our modern society we rarely talk about it , " he said			2
" i think that if we were more aware of our own expiration , i 'm sure we 'd make better choices while we are alive			1
" at the time of this writing , with two weeks to go , pledges for the @entity52 death watch are at just more than $ 70,000			1
their goal was $ 25,000			0
so , clearly , people are pretty excited about confronting their demise			0
though hopefully not enough to test it out with a moving train			0
" i still have 30 years			0
bring it , @entity140 ! " smack ! " i think @entity141 forgot to carry the one			0
" " dibs on his football phone ! " follow @entity145 on @entity146 .			0

@entity52 counts down to let you know when you will die
the idea is to make you aware of death and appreciate being alive
the @entity52 watch also tells normal time
