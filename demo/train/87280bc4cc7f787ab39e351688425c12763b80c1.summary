@entity0 -- @entity2 , the editor of @entity3 , walked out of @entity0 's @entity4 after being freed on bail thursday , nine days after he was arrested for questioning about alleged sex crimes in @entity7			1
his time in solitary confinement prompted him " to reflect on the condition of those people around the world also in solitary confinement ... in positions that are more difficult than those faced by me			1
those people ... also need your attention and support , " he said			0
@entity2 thanked the public , the media , his lawyers , and the @entity24 justice system , saying , " if justice is not always an outcome , at least it is not dead yet			1
" @entity2 , 39 , handed himself over to police in @entity0 last week			1
he was sought because @entity7 prosecutors want to question him about sex charges unrelated to @entity3			1
a judge granted him bail on tuesday , but lawyers representing @entity7 immediately filed an appeal , keeping @entity2 behind bars until the high court judge decided on the @entity7 appeal			1
@entity2 won the appeal thursday			1
@entity2 's mother , @entity37 , said after the ruling that she could " not wait " to see him " and to hold him close			1
" " i had faith that the @entity24 justice system would do the right thing ... and that faith has been confirmed , " she said outside the court			0
@entity2 must stay at the mansion of a supporter outside @entity0 , report to the police daily , wear an electronic tag to monitor his location , and put up 200,000 pounds ( about $ 310,000 ) in bail money , plus two 20,000 - pound sureties ( about $ 31,000 each ) , the judge ruled			1
judge @entity54 said he did not regard @entity2 as a fugitive and there was no concrete evidence to believe he would abscond			1
@entity2 " clearly has some desire to clear his name , " the judge said , adding that if he failed to appear in court , the " charges would always be hanging over his head			2
" @entity2 has the potential to flee , @entity54 found , but said if he did so , it would " diminish him in the eyes of his supporters			2
" lawyers representing @entity7 prosecutors had argued that no bail conditions would be satisfactory , prompting @entity2 's lawyer , @entity73 , to suggest derisively that they saw him as " some sort of @entity76 character			1
" granting bail " does not signify any change in the ongoing investigation , " @entity7 prosecutor @entity77 said in a statement after the ruling , adding that extradition proceedings are in the hands of the @entity24 authorities , not the @entity7			1
@entity24 's @entity86 , which represented @entity7 authorities in the fight over bail , said thursday that @entity90 " fully supported " their decision to appeal tuesday against granting @entity2 bail			1
@entity93 , who offered his mansion to satisfy court requirements that @entity2 have a permanent address , said the editor would be able to continue his @entity3 work from there			2
he noted that the court had ordered @entity7 to pay the cost of the appeal , " which to me suggests they should n't have appealed			2
" and he said the judge was very clear that @entity2 is not a fugitive			2
" we 're not harboring him , we 're just giving him a bed , " @entity93 said			0
@entity93 will keep @entity2 " if not under house arrest , at least under mansion arrest , " @entity73 said at tuesday 's bail hearing			1
after his arrival at @entity93 's @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity2 told reporters that his " highest task " was to continue his work with @entity3			2
" obviously , clearing my name is also important , and i will continue to do that , my legal team will continue to do that , " he said			0
" we will press the @entity7 government to provide us with evidence of the allegations , something that has been denied to date			2
i have yet to receive a single page of anything ever from this investigation			0
" he said his arrest " confirmed to me personally that we are on the right path and has given me enough anger about the situation to last me 100 years			1
" " obviously there have been serious attempts to take down the content by taking us down as an organization and taking me down as an individual , " he said			0
cheers of " @entity2 , @entity139 , @entity140 , out , out , out ! " and " exposing war crimes is no crime ! " went up from his supporters outside the @entity4 after the decision was announced thursday			1
prominent left - wing journalist @entity146 , an @entity2 backer , called the ruling " very good news but it should have happened a long time ago			2
this hearing was a waste of taxpayers ' money			0
" and he warned about " the specter of @entity2 being extradited to the @entity154 , where he could end up in a maximum security prison			2
" @entity157 told journalists as he entered court thursday that a number of people have offered to help pay @entity2 's bail , and that the money is " in the banking system			1
" socialite @entity165 and @entity146 have previously offered money for his bail			0
@entity2 is facing accusations of rape , sexual molestation and illegal use of force stemming from separate incidents in august in @entity175			0
he has not been charged , but he could face two years in prison if convicted			0
his lawyers deny the allegations and have vowed to fight any attempts at extradition			0
the next hearing in the extradition case is scheduled for january 11			0
last week , @entity154 attorney general @entity183 said he had authorized " significant " actions related to a criminal investigation into @entity3 ' publication of thousands of confidential diplomatic cables , but has declined to elaborate			0
only a small fraction of the 250,000 @entity190 documents @entity3 says it has have been released , and more are being published daily			0
@entity154 authorities and other @entity193 leaders say the documents ' publication threatens lives and national security			0
@entity3 and its supporters say the public has a right to know what goes on behind diplomatic doors			0
earlier this year , @entity3 posted thousands of documents related to the wars in @entity205 and @entity206			0
@entity1 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity2 says he has " enough anger about the situation to last me 100 years "
being in solitary confinement made @entity2 think of other prisoners , he says
freeing @entity2 on bail will not affect the @entity7 investigation , authorities there say
@entity2 is wanted for questioning in @entity7 over alleged sex crimes
