@entity0 -- the details of the prisoner - exchange deal announced between @entity3 and @entity6 -- a swap of @entity8 , the @entity3 soldier held captive by @entity6 since 2006 , for more than 1,000 @entity10 prisoners -- are not yet fully known			1
but after five years of failed negotiations , it is clear that both sides have made concessions			0
and that is a sign of hope			0
the unrest in the @entity19 , and especially in @entity20 , has been a powerful catalyst for @entity6 to capitalize while it can on @entity3 's desire to bring @entity8 home			1
the unrest in @entity26 is forcing the external political leadership of @entity6 , led by @entity28 , to relocate to the @entity29 -- further away from the front lines with @entity3 and a political environment less sympathetic to its radical policies			2
the huge upsurge of popularity for @entity6 's rival , @entity37 president @entity36 , following last month 's push for @entity40 recognition of @entity41 as a member state , would also have been a catalyst for @entity6 to conclude an agreement by being more flexible			0
the return home of 1,000 prisoners , including some ( but not all ) of the most hardcore terrorists with the blood of hundreds of @entity3 on their hands , will do wonders for @entity6 ' popularity -- not only in @entity52 but in the @entity53 and the @entity10 diaspora as well			1
from the @entity6 point of view , the time for a deal had clearly arrived			0
for @entity3 , the growing instability in @entity60 was a factor making a deal imperative now , or a risk that it would never happen			2
the @entity60 have played a major role as intermediaries , allowing both sides to negotiate without actually having to deal directly			1
( in the last stage of the bargaining , held in @entity70 since july , @entity3 's negotiators sat in one room and @entity6 in another , and the @entity60 acted as go - between			1
) the @entity60 will play a role in the actual physical exchange of the prisoners as well			1
given that @entity70 mobs sacked @entity3 's embassy there just a month ago and that the military rulers of @entity60 had to be forced ( by the @entity80 ) to intervene , @entity3 has good reason to fear that @entity60 's ability to facilitate the deal with @entity6 might not last forever			1
another consideration was the determination by the @entity87 ' new chief of staff , @entity88 , that there were no realistic military options for freeing @entity8			0
he was joined by the recently appointed heads of @entity3 's other security services -- the @entity94 and the @entity95 ( internal security ) -- who withdrew their opposition to the release of so many convicted terrorists			1
no @entity3 prime minister would have overridden the unanimous recommendations of the security establishment , and the green light for the agreement from this sector was vital			0
similarly , no @entity3 politician would have overridden public sentiment on this issue , but here the vast majority of @entity3 's public has been clearly in favor of the swap agreement for the past few years			1
this sentiment was skillfully articulated through a public campaign conducted by the @entity8 family , their friends and associates			0
@entity8 's family have been camping outside prime minister @entity122 's official residence in @entity123 for well over a year , and as they return home to prepare for the return of their son , the @entity3 public cheers their dedication			1
concern over the possible renewal of @entity10 terror following the release of so many skilled and determined terrorists is , for the moment at least , overshadowed by widespread enthusiasm at the return of the kidnapped soldier			2
there will be celebrations in both @entity3 and the @entity10 territories			2
but what are the long - term implications of this deal ? pessimists will point to the dangers of rewarding terror -- both the terror of those released from jail and the act of kidnapping @entity3 to have future terrorists released			0
cynics will ask if @entity3 's willingness to conclude the deal was not an attempt to punish @entity36 for pushing ahead with his policies in the @entity40 , despite @entity3 and @entity80 opposition			1
but there are other considerations which give grounds for optimism			0
any movement in the stalled peace process might be enough to get the wheels of this heavy cart out of the rut in which it is trapped			0
it appears that @entity170 president @entity169 had a role in the final deal , perhaps indicating a return of @entity170 to constructive dealing with @entity3			0
and the fact that @entity3 and @entity6 have talked -- albeit indirectly -- is a welcome development			2
@entity3 's 2005 withdrawal from @entity52 might have had more positive long - term effect had this channel of communication been used then			1
even more significant , the release of these prisoners removes a major obstacle from any future peace settlement between @entity3 and the @entity10			1
an agreement will almost certainly address the issue of the thousands of @entity10 remaining in @entity3 jails			2
their numbers have dropped dramatically over the past few years , as the level of violence in the occupied territories has declined -- from 11,000 in 2008 to just over 4,000 after the current prisoner swap is completed			0
but freeing almost all of the most dangerous prisoners now , in circumstances that will be endorsed by @entity3 public opinion , means there is one less impediment to be dealt with in the final settlement			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0
