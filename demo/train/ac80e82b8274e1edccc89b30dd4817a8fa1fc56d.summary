@entity0 -- an award - winning author has whipped up controversy by describing @entity5 , the @entity6 , as a " machine - made " doll with a " plastic smile " who lacks the personality and human frailty shown by @entity12			1
@entity13 , who has twice won the @entity14 for her historical novels set in @entity16 , made the comments in a talk for the @entity19 titled " @entity20 , " looking at how royal lives play out under the public gaze			1
the furor over her comments came as @entity5 carried out her first official engagement since she announced her pregnancy , with a visit to an addiction treatment clinic in @entity0			2
while there , she told reporters it would be " unnatural " if she was not nervous about having a child			2
the duchess , who is patron of the charity that runs the clinic , @entity36 , was briefly hospitalized late last year with acute morning sickness			0
she and husband @entity38 are expecting a baby in july			0
in her lecture , @entity13 described how @entity5 's public image was first defined by her clothes , and then her pregnancy			1
before she became a mother - to - be , " i saw @entity6 becoming a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung , " @entity13 said , and " a shop - window mannequin , with no personality of her own , entirely defined by what she wore			1
" now , she will be portrayed as " her only point and purpose being to give birth			0
" the author also suggested the chief attribute brought by @entity5 to her royal marriage was good manners , adding that the duchess " appeared to have been designed by a committee and built by craftsmen , with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs hand - turned and gloss - varnished			1
" and @entity13 contrasted that with the potential for disaster that @entity12 , the @entity66 and mother to princes @entity38 and @entity69 , carried with her , saying @entity6 was " irreproachable : as painfully thin as anyone could wish , without quirks , without oddities , without the risk of the emergence of character			1
" unlike @entity12 , " whose human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every gesture , " @entity13 said , @entity6 appears to be " precision - made , machine - made			1
" in the first official portrait of the duchess , unveiled by artist @entity84 in january , her " eyes are dead " and she wears a strained smile , the author added			2
@entity13 was also critical of the public and the media , which , she suggests , place royal women under unhealthy scrutiny , particularly when it comes to producing a royal heir			2
nonetheless , her words attracted fierce criticism tuesday			0
royal commentator @entity95 dismissed @entity13 's remarks as " a cheap publicity stunt " and questioned whether she had ever met @entity5 or seen her at work			1
" people who meet @entity6 warm to her , " he told @entity1			2
" she has a winning smile and easy charm			1
yes , she has a long way to go , and is not the new princess @entity12 as many in the media are hoping for			0
" but i think she is slowly but surely carving out a role for herself			0
" in the @entity108 newspaper , women 's editor @entity106 branded @entity13 's comments " not only unfounded , but incredibly cheap			1
" opinion : author 's rant on @entity5 ' mean and cheap ' it is very early days for @entity6 as a royal , and her image is being carefully managed , @entity113 said			1
" she has ample time to develop her public persona and become a fully - fledged role model if needs be , " she said			0
nor does @entity5 have the luxury of answering criticism , she added			2
" as a fully paid - up member of the royal family , she can only respond by doing the very same thing @entity13 has criticized her for : staying quiet			1
" the @entity127 also blasted @entity13 's comments as " an astonishing and venomous attack			1
" @entity13 's literary agent , @entity129 , said tuesday the author had no comment on the controversy over her lecture			1
" the article speaks for itself , " he said			0
@entity136 last year became the first woman to twice win the @entity14 , for her novel " @entity135			0
" she previously won in 2009 with " @entity139			0
" her novels focus on the @entity141 -- and in the lecture , she draws a parallel between the current fascination with @entity5 's body and the public scrutiny under which the wives of @entity148 sought to produce a male heir			2
last week , an @entity151 magazine provoked an uproar in the @entity154 media when it published pictures of a bikini - clad @entity5 on vacation , with her " baby bump " visible			1
@entity159 officials said they were disappointed by what they said was a clear breach of privacy			0
" long before @entity6 's big news was announced , the tabloids wanted to look inside her to see if she was pregnant , " @entity13 said			1
" cheerful curiosity can easily become cruelty			0
it can easily become fatal			0
we do n't cut off the heads of royal ladies these days , but we do sacrifice them , and we did memorably drive one to destruction a scant generation ago			0
" the institution of monarchy may be irrational , @entity13 added , but those outside do n't have to forget their principles as they observe the " entertainment " the royals provide			2
" i 'm not asking for censorship			0
i 'm not asking for pious humbug and smarmy reverence			0
i 'm asking us to back off and not be brutes , " she said			0
@entity184 , director of the @entity185 for @entity186 at the @entity187 , defended @entity13 via @entity188 , saying the furor exemplified the author 's point about the media 's role			2
" the @entity195 row is caused by the @entity127 turning @entity13 's rather wonderful lecture into an example of exactly what @entity136 warns of ... " she said			1
@entity1 's royal correspondent @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
