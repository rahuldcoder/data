@entity0 -- @entity2 mails left by @entity3 for his then - girlfriend @entity4 were illegally accessed and heard by a former employee of a major @entity8 newspaper group , @entity4 told an independent investigation into press ethics thursday			1
the former @entity11 left about 25 messages for her one night in 2001 , including one where he sang to her , as he tried to make up with her after a quarrel , she said			0
" one of them said , ' please forgive me , ' and he sang a little ditty of one of his songs onto the voice mail , " said @entity4			1
the former @entity23 group employee later phoned her and said he had heard her voice mail			1
she responded angrily , she testified before the @entity25 , saying there was no way he could have heard the message unless he had obtained it illegally			2
@entity4 said the man laughed , and she said she told him : " i promise you , if you report this story , even if it 's true , you have obtained the information illegally , and i will do something about it			2
" " and he never reported the story , " she added			0
the inquiry is not releasing the name of the person who heard the message because he is under police investigation , said @entity43 , the chief counsel to the @entity25			1
but it was not a @entity46 journalist or anyone working under the supervision of its then - editor , @entity49 , @entity43 said			1
@entity49 now hosts a @entity1 talk show , " @entity52			2
" the voice mail in question was a critical point when @entity49 testified in december before the @entity25			1
the probe was set up in response to widespread anger in @entity8 at the revelation that a murdered 13 - year - old girl 's phone was hacked by journalists in search of stories -- and that many other crime and terror victims , politicians and celebrities had also been targeted			2
@entity69 's @entity71 tabloid has been the focus of much of the anger , and @entity69 's son @entity73 ordered it shut down over the scandal			1
but accusations have been leveled against other newspapers as well , including the @entity46			0
testifying in december , @entity49 said he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid , prompting @entity43 to follow up : " you do n't believe so or you are sure ? " " i do n't believe so , " @entity49 responded by video link			1
@entity43 pressed @entity49 particularly hard about his having written in 2006 that he had heard a message @entity3 left for @entity4 , trying to make up after a quarrel and singing to her			1
@entity49 refused to say who played the message for him or where , but he admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail			1
" did you know that was unethical ? " @entity43 demanded			0
" not unethical , no. it does n't necessarily follow that it was unethical , " @entity49 said , insisting he would not " go down a trail that will lead to the identification of a source			2
" on thursday , @entity4 said she had never authorized @entity49 to access her voice mail or to listen to a recording of it			1
" never , ever , " she said			0
she said she had never made a recording of any of the messages			0
" no , no. they were deleted pretty much straight away , " she said			0
@entity102 , the judge leading the inquiry , intervened to ask if she had ever authorized anyone to listen to her voice mail			1
" no , " she said			0
@entity4 and @entity3 divorced in 2008			0
@entity49 has said in the past that he has never hacked a voice mail and vigorously denied ever ordering phone hacking			1
@entity49 said thursday , " i have nothing further to add to the evidence i gave to the @entity25			2
" the publisher of the defunct @entity71 paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds wednesday to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians , including former @entity115 spokesman @entity114			2
@entity49 is a former editor the @entity71 , but left in 1995 -- about seven years before the @entity117 hacking -- and went to the @entity23 , which he edited until 2004			2
with wednesday 's settlements , @entity118 has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it			1
but former child singing star @entity122 , who has testified publicly about the damage phone hacking did to her personal life , has refused to settle			0
her case is expected to go to court as soon as this month			0
in addition to the @entity25 , police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of the scandal : phone hacking , e-mail hacking , and police bribery			1
two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal			0
both @entity73 and @entity69 , as well as senior executives at @entity118 , have testified before @entity8 lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing			0
there have been 13 arrests in connection with @entity144 , the @entity146 investigation into bribery of police officers by journalists			0
there have been 17 arrests in relation to @entity153 , the phone - hacking inquiry			1
three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations			0
no one has been charged			0
