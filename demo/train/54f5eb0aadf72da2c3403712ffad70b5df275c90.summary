-- friday 's crash of @entity3 's @entity2 , with its tragic loss of life , comes just three days after the failure of @entity9 's @entity8 re-supply mission to the @entity10			1
launching spaceships is obviously a very difficult business			1
the payload sits atop a huge amount of fuel , often weighing many times more than the satellite or material being sent into space			0
every physics student knows the rocket problem : you need a lot of fuel to get a heavy spacecraft moving , and the weight of the unburned fuel itself has to be lifted as well			1
to increase the weight of the payload a rocket can lift , more fuel is needed , enough to lift the extra payload weight and lift the weight of the extra fuel			1
it 's kind of like compound interest			1
add more mass to the payload and you have to add a lot more fuel			0
the payload carried on the failed @entity8 rocket was reportedly about 1 % as heavy as the spacecraft plus fuel			1
that means the majority 99 % was working hard to lift the 1 % dead weight			2
early rocket designers realized the advantage of using two separate lift stages			2
after the fuel in the first stage has completely burned up , its container can be jettisoned , lightening the total spacecraft weight by much more than the burned fuel			0
the second stage can then accelerate the payload faster than if the empty fuel tank were still attached			0
the first stage has to do the most work because it lifts the full weight of payload plus fuel from a dead stop			0
the second stage has an easier job since the rocket is already moving and is much lighter without the weight of the first stage fuel plus container			2
another design advance was to operate stages in parallel			0
that accelerates the rocket faster because at no point are any rocket stages dead weight			2
analysis : will space accidents deter pioneer tourists ? the history of rocket development is littered with explosions , back to the first reported rockets in 14th century @entity80 and @entity81			1
even sophisticated systems well along the development path , like @entity85 's space shuttle , had failures			1
@entity9 and @entity3 are still developing their technologies and processes			1
@entity85 's long record of mostly successful launches made spaceflight look so routine that we may have forgotten how difficult it is			1
could the modern world do without launching materials and people into space ? probably not			2
satellites and other spacecraft are an integral part of navigation , weather , space science , earth science and ultra-fast global communications -- not to mention robotic and human exploration			0
even if we forgo exotic trips to @entity109 , an awful lot of technology here on @entity113 wo n't work without space assets			0
launching @entity115 into space is n't for the faint of heart			0
but it 's still the future .			0

the crash of @entity3 's @entity2 comes on heels of a rocket explosion
