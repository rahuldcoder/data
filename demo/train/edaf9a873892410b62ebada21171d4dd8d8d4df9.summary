-- the trial against members of the so - called @entity4 militia resumes thursday as the @entity7 - based group 's leader @entity5 and his son , @entity8 , face weapons charges			1
the stakes , however , are considerably lower after a federal judge in @entity12 on tuesday dropped the more serious charges of sedition and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against the government			1
the directed verdict cleared several of the original nine defendants of all charges			2
federal authorities accused the nine members of the " @entity27 warrior " militia of homegrown terrorism			1
the @entity28 planted a secret informant and @entity28 agent in the militia in 2008 to record the activities of the group			2
the video and audio recordings became the crux of the federal case , including clips of the elder @entity5 making anti-government statements and remarks about killing police officers			2
the defendants all faced a maximum sentence of life in prison			0
but in a trial that began in early february , federal district judge @entity46 said she did not find that the government 's evidence sufficiently proved that the @entity4 militia had planned a conspiracy against the government			1
" the government 's case is built largely of circumstantial evidence , " @entity46 explained tuesday in her 28 - page ruling			0
" while this evidence could certainly lead a rational fact finder to conclude that ' something fishy ' was going on , it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity62 reached a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the @entity55			0
" " pick a sentence here , pick a sentence there -- the ( remarks were ) taken out of context , " a defense attorney for one of the cleared militia members said			1
" we always said it was a @entity76 and @entity77 case , and that 's what it ended up being , " added attorney @entity72 , whose client , @entity73 , is the wife of the elder @entity5			0
the charges dismissed tuesday marked the second anniversary of the arrests of the nine militia members , at least five of whom no longer face charges after @entity46 ' ruling			1
it is , in my opinion , a great day for the @entity92 and for the rule of law , " the elder @entity5 's defense attorney , @entity89 , said			0
" we 're grateful that the judge did what she did			2
" the @entity4 militia members cleared of all charges are @entity73 , 46 ; @entity5 , 22 , another son of the elder @entity5 ; @entity100 , 48 ; @entity101 , 40 ; and @entity102 , 29			1
defendant @entity4 , 30 , awaits his sentence after pleading guilty to a weapons charge in december			1
another defendant , @entity105 , 35 , will be tried separately			0
the remaining charges of weapons possession rest on the elder @entity5 and his son , @entity8 , both of whom have already spent two years in prison			1
the government claims the two militia members were in possession of unregistered automatic weapons			1
if convicted , the pair could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison			0
" i did n't figure we were doing anything wrong -- in the lines of going out there and doing the trainings -- to me it was basically fun , " @entity73 said wednesday			0
" i 'm worried for my husband and son			0
i guess i will be able to live my life a little easier once they 're home			0
" the @entity132 attorney 's office in @entity7 and the @entity28 declined to comment on the trial while the case is still under way .			2

nine members of the @entity4 militia were arrested in 2010
federal authorities charged they were conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction
