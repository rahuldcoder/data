the @entity0 has just passed , 72 - 2 , an 8 % tax on candy , chips and other high - calorie foods			1
it continues to debate a special additional tax of about 8 cents per liter on sugary soda			1
you can understand why @entity10 leaders are worried about their nation 's eating habits			1
@entity10 consume more sugary soft drinks per person than any other people on earth			1
@entity10 suffers the highest incidence of diabetes among the 34 countries in the @entity20			2
@entity10 are more likely to be obese even than @entity21 , the next runner - up			1
taxes on junk foods constitute just a part of a vast fiscal reform proposed by @entity10 's new president , @entity27			1
the overall plan aims to rationalize tax collections , curtail tax evasion and shift @entity10 away from dependence on oil revenues			1
that 's all a topic for another day			0
the question for today is : will fat taxes work ? there 's reason for pessimism			0
in 2011 , @entity39 became the first country to impose a tax on fatty foods			1
less than a year later , it became the first country to abolish the tax			0
in the words of the @entity47 tax ministry : " the fat tax and the extension of the chocolate tax , the so - called sugar tax , has been criticized for increasing prices for consumers , increasing companies ' administrative costs and putting @entity47 jobs at risk			0
at the same time it is believed that the fat tax has , to a lesser extent , contributed to @entity47 traveling across the border to make purchases			0
" economists doubt that the moderate tax increases imposed in @entity39 or proposed for @entity10 will suffice to alter behavior			1
adjusting for inflation , soda prices have declined by nearly 40 % in the last three decades , and soda consumption was already disturbingly high in 1980			0
to counteract such a price drop would require very large tax increases			0
but high soda taxes would likely encourage smuggling , tax evasion and other efforts to game the system			2
it might work better to pay people to eat better , rather than tax them for making unhealthy choices			0
@entity80 's @entity79 reported in 2012 on a study at @entity82 in which participants were offered cash if they ate more fruits and vegetables and exercised more			0
researchers were surprised to see that the participants kept up their new good habits even after the payments stopped , according the study 's lead author , @entity91			0
" we thought they 'd do it while we were paying them , but the minute we stopped they 'd go back to their bad habits			0
but they continued to maintain a large improvement in their health behaviors			0
" the @entity10 fat - tax experiment is n't bolstered by payouts of pesos			1
but it 's probably still worth a try , and for three reasons : first , the @entity47 failure is not dispositive			2
@entity39 is a small place with a lively tradition of cross-border shopping			2
from @entity114 , it is an easy 35 - minute drive to @entity115 , @entity116 's third - largest city			0
@entity39 conveniently adjoins shopping in northern @entity117			2
@entity10 's population is concentrated in and around the capital city , far from any border			1
second , while incentives may work better than penalties in controlled experiments , it seems administratively unfeasible to operate such schemes on any large scale			0
it 's one thing to weigh and pay 204 people , a very different thing to weigh and pay millions of them			0
finally @entity10 's obesity problem is much worse than @entity39 's -- and trending fast in the wrong direction			1
even marginal improvements are worth pursuing there			0
in particular , simply reducing @entity10 soda consumption could yield substantial benefits			2
when things are bad enough , policymakers have more reason to say : " what the heck , it 's worth a try			2
" there 's one last thing that needs to be said about @entity10 's emerging experiment with fat taxes			1
when @entity21 talk about immigration from @entity10 , there exists a tendency to speak of @entity10 as a nation of desperate poverty , a kind of @entity152 on the @entity153 , from which people naturally wish to flee by any means possible			1
in fact , by any global standard , @entity10 is a reasonably successful country			2
@entity10 is not especially poor : gross domestic product per capita is well above the global median			2
within the @entity160 , @entity10 is poorer than @entity161 and @entity162 , but richer than @entity163 and oil - producing @entity164			2
@entity10 's election system is fairer , more impartial and more reliable than that of the @entity21			1
@entity10 is a country of free speech and free exercise of religion			2
it scores poorly on international rankings of social mobility			0
but so does the @entity21 , and the indications are that @entity10 who migrate to the @entity21 face particularly poor opportunities here			1
there is one respect , however , in which @entity10 has historically done poorly : providing enough work for all its people			0
@entity10 's economy is slowed by a wasteful and expensive public sector and by rules biased toward monopoly and oligopoly in the private sector			1
@entity10 elites have historically preferred to address their employment problems by encouraging the discontented to migrate northward			0
almost one in 10 of people born in @entity10 now live in the @entity21 , mostly illegally			1
this migration has helped @entity10 avoid reckoning with its domestic problems , by the simple device of transferring the people disadvantaged by those problems to another jurisdiction			0
very understandably , @entity10 want jobs and higher wages			0
aware that powerful interest groups in the @entity21 have paralyzed the enforcement of immigration laws , many ambitious @entity10 have ignored @entity21 law to seek those jobs and higher wages north of the border			1
that migration has had real costs for @entity21 , however			0
and when it is suggested that those who migrated illegally be pressed to return home , immigration advocates respond with horror : how can any decent person propose such a thing ? return these destitute people home to starve ? but as the @entity10 @entity0 acknowledges , @entity10 are not fleeing starvation			1
@entity21 should pay @entity10 the respect of acknowledging its success and advances -- and expect in return that @entity10 authorities will respect @entity21 law and cooperate in its enforcement .			1

@entity226 : @entity0 passed junk food tax and is *mulling* a tax on sugary soda
he says tax on junk foods is part of @entity10 president 's fiscal reform
@entity226 says such a tax failed in @entity39 , but @entity10 's problem is worse and worth try anyway
@entity241 : problem raises issue of whether illegal immigrants to @entity21 are really fleeing starvation
