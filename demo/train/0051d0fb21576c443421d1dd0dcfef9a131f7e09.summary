@entity0 -- they live largely unseen , in towering @entity0 apartment blocks , trapped in a life of servitude to pay back crippling debts to unscrupulous recruiters who 've lied to convince them to sign up			1
according to a new report from @entity12 , thousands of domestic workers from @entity10 are being duped into working in the city by brokers and agencies solely focused on profit			1
" every step of the way , from the moment their documents are confiscated in @entity10 their movements are controlled in @entity0 , " said @entity17 , the author of the report " exploited for profit , failed by governments			1
" " the recruitment agency tells the employer , ' do n't let your workers out for the first seven months when they pay their recruitment fees			2
do n't let them talk to other @entity10 workers			2
' every aspect of their lives is controlled for the purpose of getting the money , " said @entity17 , @entity12 's @entity34 migrants ' rights researcher			2
the report accuses the @entity10 and @entity0 governments of turning a blind eye to the problem because domestic workers provide a valuable service to the city , and send much of the money they earn back to @entity10			1
in response to the report , the @entity10 consulate in @entity0 released a statement saying " the protection of the @entity10 citizens abroad is the priority of the @entity10 government , " and " we have a full commitment to do that with all possible means and resources			1
" the @entity0 @entity60 also issued a statement saying , in part : " we do not allow abuse of @entity64 [ foreign domestic helpers ] including underpayment of wages , non-granting of weekly rest days and statutory holidays etc. any abuse that is supported by sufficient evidence will be prosecuted			1
" @entity0 's domestic help as of september , almost 150,000 @entity10 domestic workers , or " helpers " as they 're known , were living and working in @entity0 , almost half the total number of 319,000			1
the others are mainly @entity78			0
while they come to do the same job , @entity78 receive more support from their own government , and do n't have to pay the same extortionate recruitment fees that tie their @entity10 counterparts to months , if not years , of debt , @entity17 said			2
" it 's more problematic with the @entity10 because they do n't get the support they need from the @entity10 government and the recruitment companies can pretty much do what they like , " she said			2
while the report is based on in - depth interviews with 97 workers who sought help , @entity12 said its findings were backed by an independent survey of nearly 1,000 women by the @entity10 @entity100 ( @entity101 ) conducted in @entity0 in 2011			1
signing up for debt the typical story starts back in @entity10 where brokers convince poorer women to seek work in @entity0			1
they 're taken to training centers , sometimes hours from home , where they spend anywhere between 10 days and 15 months learning the skills and language -- cantonese -- to do the job , according to the report			0
in many cases , their documents are taken , along with their phones , and they 're allowed only limited contact with their families			0
some women told researchers they were forced to cut off all their hair , while others were given mandatory contraceptive injections to avoid pregnancy on short visits home			0
once in @entity0 , @entity12 says local recruitment agencies step in to ensure workers repay their debts			1
according to the @entity101 survey , 85 % of women said recruitment fees of around hk $ 3,000 a month were deducted from their monthly wage for seven months , taking the total recruitment cost to hkd $ 21,000 ( us $ 2.700 )			0
the fee far exceeds the limits set by both the @entity10 and @entity0 governments			1
under @entity0 law , employment agencies are not allowed to charge more than 10 % of a worker 's monthly wage , or hk $ 401 ( us $ 52 )			0
@entity10 limits the fee to idr 14,780,400 or hk $ 13,436 ( us $ 1,730 )			0
in october , the minimum wage for domestic workers rose to hk $ 4,010.00 ( us $ 517 ) , leaving little left after the monthly fee deduction			1
and for some it does n't end there			0
" if they want more recruitment fees , they 'll manipulate it , " @entity17 said , explaining that some recruitment agencies tell employers to terminate their workers after seven months so they can be placed with another employer , with a new set of fees			2
nowhere to go the pressure to repay their recruitment fees prevents many domestic workers from leaving abusive employers , the report said			1
stories of the mistreatment of foreign domestic workers are n't too hard to find in @entity0			1
recently , an extreme example made headlines when a couple was jailed for subjecting their @entity10 helper to " cruel " and " vicious " abuse			0
the court heard @entity177 , 30 , was whipped with bicycle chains and bound with cables during her two - year contract			0
read more : despite abuses , foreign domestic workers flock to @entity0 under @entity0 law , it 's illegal for domestic workers to live - out so they sleep in their employers ' flats			1
no limits are imposed on daily work hours , though they 're entitled to 24 hours off each week , usually on a sunday , when thousands gather in public areas in @entity0 to catch up with friends			2
standard duties include cleaning , general household chores and childcare , but some report having to work , illegally , in employers ' businesses			0
one woman told @entity12 she 'd been told she 'd be taking care of an elderly woman			0
instead , she had to carry vegetables at a market and sort trash			0
" without gloves , i had to pick through the rubbish to find items that could be recycled			0
i then carried them , which were often very heavy , to a center where i could sell them			0
it was truly horrible work , but i remained because i needed to pay off my recruitment fees , " she said			0
what needs to be done @entity12 has called on both governments to do more to stop unscrupulous recruiters , end the requirement for workers to live - in and make it easier for them to seek help			1
both @entity0 and @entity10 say they 've taken steps to clampdown on recruiters , and they 're already distributing information letting domestic helpers know how and when to file a complaint			1
in its statement to @entity1 , the @entity0 @entity60 said in 2012 it revoked two employment agency licenses , one of which was due to overcharging			0
it added : " the issue of overcharging @entity10 domestic helpers of agency fees back in @entity10 is beyond our jurisdiction and should be tackled at source by the country of origin			1
" the @entity10 consulate said it had an annual system for evaluating and accrediting agencies in @entity0			2
since 2009 , it said 26 agencies had " received punishments for their misconducts , " ranging from warnings , to suspensions and cancellation of licenses			0
and as of june , 190 employers had been banned from hiring domestic workers , it added			1
@entity12 said it 's not enough			0
" we need to see current laws enforced and people face justice for the exploitation			0
only then will we start to see an end to forced labor from @entity10 to @entity0 , " @entity17 said .			2
