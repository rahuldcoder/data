-- lab tests found hundreds of cases of salmonella contamination at an @entity6 farm in a nearly two - year period before the outbreak that prompted a massive recall of eggs this summer , congressional investigators said tuesday			1
@entity11 is one of two farms at the center of the massive recall			0
in a letter to its owner , @entity19 , leaders of the @entity17 said tests confirmed 426 cases of salmonella contamination between september 2008 and the past july , and 73 were " potentially " positive for the strain of the disease involved in this year 's outbreak			1
the committee 's @entity27 leaders asked @entity19 to explain those findings when he appears at a september 21 hearing			2
they also called on him to explain why those test reports were n't included in material the company has provided to @entity34 so far , and demanded that the company produce " all documents relating to your response to the test results " by wednesday			1
" despite the committee 's specific request , your response on september 11 , 2010 , did not include the 73 potentially positive results for @entity48 , " @entity17 chairman @entity41 and investigations subcommittee chairman @entity40 wrote			2
" it also did not show whether @entity11 took appropriate steps to protect the public after receiving the positive test results			0
" @entity11 and another @entity6 producer , @entity54 , were forced to recall about 550 million eggs in august after health officials linked them to the salmonella outbreak , which has so far been blamed for more than 1,500 illnesses across the @entity59			1
@entity11 and other operations owned by the @entity19 family have come under increased scrutiny since the outbreak			1
in a written statement responding to the letter , the company said it previously pledged to " fully respond " to the committee 's requests for documents			2
" at that time , we also indicated that our response was ongoing , " it said			0
the company said it was " terribly disappointed " to find positive tests for salmonella in its eggs , but said it provided results of those voluntary tests " as soon as those results were available			1
" " we believe our open communication about our forthright efforts to compile testing data and provide documents as requested is consistent with our ongoing cooperation with this investigation , " it said			0
" we have provided the committee with additional testing documentation today and will continue to do so as we restore past testing records			0
" @entity48 occurs naturally in chickens , but @entity91 inspectors reported in august that neither @entity92 nor @entity93 fully followed their plans to prevent salmonella enteritidis			0
federal investigators reported finding salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at the farms , as well as rodents , piles of manure , uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count , the @entity91 said .			0
