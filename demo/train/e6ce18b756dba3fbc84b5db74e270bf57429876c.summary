-- @entity2 captain @entity1 insists it is " absolutely possible " that his side can regain the ashes by thrashing @entity6 5 - 0			1
@entity1 's side surrendered the famous urn to their bitter rivals last year when @entity6 won the @entity11 series 2 - 1 on home soil			1
but the last time @entity6 travelled to @entity2 as holders , in 2006 , they were beaten in all five test matches			2
and @entity1 , 35 , now believes his new - look side -- who have won eight of their last ten @entity11 matches -- are capable of a repeat performance when the series gets underway in november			2
asked if @entity2 could whitewash @entity22 told reporters : " it 's absolutely possible			0
there 's no reason why not			0
we 've learnt from a lot of the mistakes that we 've made			0
" there 's no doubt we made some mistakes in the last @entity5 series in @entity6 that cost us the series			0
but we know now that we 're a more experienced and probably a better team now than we were then			0
" many of @entity2 's so - called ' golden generation ' have retired in recent years including leg spin bowler @entity38 , seam bowler @entity40 and batsmen @entity41 and @entity42 , leaving @entity1 to mould a younger side			1
they have been in good form of late but were recently held to a 1 - 1 test series draw by @entity46 when the two sides met in @entity6			1
yet @entity6 are already 2 - 0 up in their own four @entity11 series with @entity46 , with two games played			1
when the teams last met @entity6 won a seesaw series 2 - 1 , thanks to a dramatic victory at the @entity54 in the final test when @entity56 scored a century on his debut			1
and @entity56 suggested @entity1 may have put unnecessary pressure on his team by talking up their chances of a resounding victory			2
speaking ahead of the third test with @entity46 , he told reporters : " i do n't know @entity1 that well -- i do n't know his character or what he would be meaning saying stuff like that			0
" but if i were to say something like that i 'd find it put pressure on me and the team more than if we just go about our business like i know we will			0
