@entity0 -- tuesday night was fight night in @entity0			1
seven @entity3 presidential candidates clashed sharply over issues such as illegal immigration , taxes and health care at a presidential debate in @entity9 sponsored by @entity1 and the @entity10			1
but it was the three @entity3 front - runners -- former @entity14 executive @entity13 , former @entity16 gov. @entity15 and @entity18 gov @entity17 -- who came under frequent attack			1
the long - standing bad blood between @entity15 and @entity17 boiled over in the debate 's first hour as the two @entity3 heavyweights traded harsh accusations and showed flashes of anger			1
@entity15 laughed in @entity17 's face when the @entity18 criticized his rival for hiring illegal immigrants to work on his lawn , a controversy uncovered by the @entity33 during @entity15 's first presidential bid in 2008			1
" @entity15 , you lose all of your standing , from my perspective , because you hired illegals in your home , and you knew about it for a year , " @entity17 said , turning straight to @entity15			1
" and the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you 're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy			0
" @entity3 debate takes negative turn when @entity15 tried to respond , @entity17 refused to let him answer			1
" you get 30 seconds , " @entity15 said , looking to moderator @entity51			1
" this is the way the rules work here , is that i get 60 seconds and then you get 30 seconds to respond			0
right ? @entity51 ? " @entity17 interrupted : " and they want to hear you say that you knew you had illegals working at your ... " " would you please wait ? " a frustrated @entity15 shot back			1
" are you just going to keep talking ? " " yes , sir , " @entity17 said			1
an exasperated @entity15 tried to rise above the squabble			1
" you have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking , " @entity15 said			1
" and i suggest that if you want to become president of the @entity65 , you have got to let both people speak			0
so first , let me speak			0
" @entity15 fired back that @entity17 failed to secure the @entity18 border and again raised questions about his support for a law that granted in - state college tuition to the children of illegal immigrants			1
" @entity18 has had 60 % increase in illegal immigrants in @entity18 , " @entity15 charged			1
" if there 's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that does n't stand up to muster , it 's you , not me			0
" @entity83 : give us your take on the candidates @entity17 's debate performance was , by far , his feistiest to date			1
after surging to the top of @entity3 polls on joining the presidential race in august , @entity17 saw his standing slip among @entity3 voters after a series of lackluster debate showings			1
but it was not clear as the debate concluded tuesday whether @entity17 's aggressive tack would hurt him or help him			2
a seemingly @entity15 - friendly audience in @entity0 booed when @entity17 turned up the heat , and after the debate , one of @entity15 's senior advisers claimed that @entity17 only hurt himself by going so negative			1
" @entity17 came in to kill @entity15 , but he killed himself , " @entity15 adviser @entity103 said in the post-debate spin room			1
@entity105 , @entity17 's communications director , claimed victory and called @entity15 a " slick guy " who will " change positions on a dime			1
" " he is back to running again , " @entity105 said of @entity17			2
" this is a campaign that is in for the long haul			0
" @entity13 , meanwhile , was at the center of a pile - on as the debate began			1
his @entity3 rivals took turns picking apart his " 9 - 9 - 9 " plan to reform the @entity65 tax code			1
the plan would throw out the current tax system and implement a 9 % corporate income tax rate , a 9 % income tax rate and a 9 % national sales tax			0
truth squad : fact checking the @entity3 debate the other six republicans on stage -- who have watched @entity13 soar to the top of the polls in recent weeks thanks to his straightforward message and outsider image -- were united in calling the tax plan simplistic and risky			1
" there are much more complexities than @entity13 lets on , " said former house speaker @entity139			2
@entity18 rep. @entity142 called the plan " dangerous " and said it would increase taxes on low - income citizens			0
@entity17 told @entity13 that voters " are not interested in 9 - 9 - 9 ; what they are interested in is flatter and fairer			1
" " i will bump plans with you , brother , and we will see who has the best idea about getting this country working again , " @entity17 said			2
" it 's not going to fly			0
" @entity15 said @entity13 's plan would add federal taxes on top of state taxes			1
@entity13 said his plan would not raise taxes on poor people and said his opponents were misrepresenting his plan			2
" the reason my plan is being attacked so much is the lobbyists accountants and politicians			0
they do n't want to throw out current tax code and replace with something that 's simple and fair , " @entity13 responded			2
the former businessman also stumbled when the debate turned to topics like immigration and foreign policy			0
just hours after telling @entity1 's @entity179 that he would consider negotiating a prisoner swap with @entity181 , @entity13 denied that he had said any such thing			2
he changed his answer after the debate in a follow - up interview with @entity51 and said he would not negotiate with terrorists			0
" i misspoke , " @entity13 said			2
" because i did n't , you know , things are moving so fast , i misspoke			0
i would not do that			0
i simply would not do that			0
" they were joined on the stage in @entity0 by former @entity194 sen. @entity193 and @entity196 rep. @entity195 , who also attacked the @entity13 plan			1
former @entity199 gov. @entity198 chose to boycott the debate because of a dispute between @entity9 and @entity202 over the @entity3 primary calendar			1
@entity198 is staking his campaign on a win in @entity202 and held a town hall there tuesday night instead			1
that left more time for the rest of the field to make their cases -- and to take aim at the front - runners			1
@entity193 called into doubt @entity15 's credibility on the matter of repealing president @entity220 's health care plan because @entity15 passed a similar plan in @entity16			2
" you just do n't have credibility , @entity15 , when it comes to repealing @entity225 , " @entity193 said			2
" you are -- you are -- your plan was the basis for @entity225			0
your consultants helped @entity220 craft @entity225			0
and to say that you 're going to repeal it , you just -- you have no track record on that that -- that we can trust you that you 're going to do that			0
" the exchange rapidly descended into a shouting match as @entity193 refused to let @entity15 respond			2
eventually , @entity15 said he would " absolutely not " impose his @entity16 plan on the rest of the country			2
@entity195 , meanwhile , took aim at the @entity13 tax plan and said it would create a de facto value added tax			2
but she repeatedly tried to refocus the debate on @entity220 instead of her @entity3 opponents			2
" we need to repeal @entity225 , repeal the @entity246 and @entity247 known as @entity248 , " she said			0
" president @entity220 's plan has been a plan for destruction for this economy and failure			0
i plan to change that			0
" the candidates were also asked about @entity256 , the controversial @entity257 pastor and @entity17 supporter who recently said the @entity259 is a " cult			1
" they seemed to agree that while a candidate 's religion is a legitimate topic in a campaign , the freedom to worship as one chooses is enshrined in the @entity266			0
" the concept that we select people based on the church or the synagogue they go to , i think , is a very dangerous and enormous departure from the principles of our @entity266 , " @entity15 said			0
@entity17 , asked if he would repudiate the @entity256 comments , said he already had			0
" i said i did not agree with pastor @entity256 ' remarks , " he said			0
" i do n't agree with them			0
i ca n't apologize any more than that			0
" @entity15 accepted the answer			0
" that 's fine , " he said			0
