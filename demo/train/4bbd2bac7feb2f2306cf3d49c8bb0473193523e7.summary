-- there were no shocks in the first round of the @entity4 sunday , except for one : eight time champion @entity5 will begin the defense of his title in the secondary @entity9 court , a move dubbed as " bizarre " by one player			1
as world number one and reigning champion , not to mention arguably the greatest player to ever grace the clay of @entity4 , @entity5 would have expected to start his campaign -- a match against @entity19 wild card @entity17 -- on the @entity21 court			1
but organizers decided to host @entity23 versus @entity24 and @entity25 versus @entity26 instead , a move which has prompted a furious reaction on social media , and amongst some players			1
" that 's really bizarre , " @entity31 told @entity32 , after the @entity19 had needed two tiebreaks to beat tough @entity35 @entity34 7 - 6 ( 7/5 ) , 7 - 6 ( 7/4 ) , 7 - 5			2
" i mean , how many times does the guy have to win the tournament to be able to have his first match on @entity40 ? " sunday 's matches saw @entity42 play in his record 58th consecutive grand slam			2
it was easy pickings for the 33 year old who beat @entity48 's @entity47 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2			0
sixth seed @entity49 also won in straight sets , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , against the @entity53 @entity52			0
another @entity53 , exciting young prospect @entity54 who came close to shocking @entity23 at the @entity55 recently , had a slightly tougher time beating @entity58 's @entity57 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 ( 7/1 ) , 6 - 3			2
world number one @entity60 began her campaign with a simple 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 victory against @entity63 of @entity35 whilst sister @entity64 beat @entity66 's @entity65 6 - 4 , 6 - 1			0
the action now moves on to monday for @entity5 and @entity23			0
" it 's a big court , there is television , so you can put it everywhere , you know , in the world , " said @entity35 number two @entity68 when asked about @entity5 's court allocation			1
" i hope it 's okay for him			0

first round of the @entity4 begins at @entity4
@entity42 , @entity31 , @entity49 , @entity68 , @entity54 all through
eight time champ @entity5 begins *tomorrow* , on second court
