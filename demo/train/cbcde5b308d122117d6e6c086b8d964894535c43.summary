@entity16 , @entity8 ( @entity3 ) -- @entity17 voted for @entity11 and began the year full of energy			1
but her hope is giving way these days to a sense that some things never change			0
" i trust his motives , " she said of president @entity11			2
" i feel like he is an honorable guy , i am not sure if he can do it			0

" @entity17 and @entity35 are among those who think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better			1

" he makes the distinction between consumer spending and what he sees as too much government spending			0
" we are going to have to pay the bill in another two or three years and it is going to be scary when it happens , " @entity48 said			2

@entity35 said the pain of losing her job and dealing with foreclosure have taught her there are some things the government ca n't do			2
" it is a good time to get back to what this country was made on -- it 's the family , " she said			0
" and you know i think for awhile we were all going crazy and overspending and living beyond our means and this has kind of been a reality check for most people			1
