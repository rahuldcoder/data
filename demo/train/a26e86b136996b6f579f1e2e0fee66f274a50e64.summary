-- african art has long been about more than just tribal masks and traditional carvings , and now contemporary @entity5 artists are being recognized globally			1
the @entity6 recently showcased the works of 400 @entity5 contemporary artists , attracting more than 10,000 visitors			1
organizer @entity10 told @entity0 there had been an explosion of interest in @entity5 art in recent years			1
" @entity5 has always had a strong tribal art and a strong craft component , and that will always stay , he said			1
" but that does n't mean there ca n't be a contemporary market existing alongside that , and if you look in @entity5 at the contemporary market in the last four or five years , it 's absolutely exploded			1
" if you look at the number of young black artists doing well , making a living , it 's extraordinary			2
five years ago it just did n't exist			2
" but the attention being bestowed on contemporary african art is a relatively new phenomenon			1
auction house @entity34 says its @entity37 sale last month was the first commercial auction dedicated solely to contemporary african art in the @entity40 , and it says the @entity42 's first auction only took place last year			1
while auction house @entity45 's @entity5 art sale and exhibition will take place on may 15 in @entity37			1
the sale will include works of contemporary art , photographs , design and editions which reflect the spirit of the continent			1
@entity58 sisters journey from civil war to @entity37 fashionistas @entity61 , director of african art at @entity34 , said these kinds of sales were still too rare			1
" in some ways it 's remarkable -- here we are in 2010 and this is the first auction of its type in @entity37 , " he told @entity0			2
" it 's never been done before			0
actually i was very surprised by that , " but he says he 's not surprised by the growing interest in @entity5 art. @entity34 says the auction has generated considerable buzz			2
prince @entity74 , who has an extensive collection of @entity77 art , was one of those in attendance			2
@entity74 told @entity0 , " i do n't promote @entity77 art in terms of the value			2
i promote in terms of the benefits and the joy it can confer to the world			0
" but monetary value is unavoidable at an art auction			1
about half of the 140 pieces at the @entity34 auction sold , with prices ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 92,000			0
the value of @entity5 art could increase as international interest develops and the buying pool expands			0
" at the moment the majority of the collectors are people who have an interest or contact with @entity5 , " said @entity61			0
" we are n't yet seeing these people buying these works without that connection			0
" look at the other markets -- no one buys a @entity108 because he 's @entity109 or because the buyer 's @entity109			0
it does n't matter where the artist was born or what nationality he was			0
but i think with the @entity5 art it still does matter			0
it has n't yet broken into the international market			0
" @entity120 's beads back in vogue while the rest of the world is catching up with @entity5 art , the artists themselves continue to push artistic boundaries			1
@entity5 @entity128 was one of the artists exhibiting at last month 's @entity6			1
his work is all about challenging the traditional			0
" i look at the ideas of stereotypes , and the idea of men sewing and the idea of how that 's a feminine activity ... [ and ask ] how do we subvert that into something that 's really not feminine ? so i am sewing and i am making artwork that 's quite edgy , " @entity128 told @entity0			0
" artists are not limited to painting and traditional ways of making art. there are other possibilities of speaking a language and finding new and innovative ways of communicating			0
" @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report			0
