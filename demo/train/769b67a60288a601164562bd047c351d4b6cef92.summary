@entity1 , @entity0 -- he is not a killer , but the state of @entity0 is determined to execute @entity6 for his crime			1
@entity6 , 43 , is on @entity0 's death row for the rape of his 8 - year - old stepdaughter			1
the @entity12 native faces that reality as he sits on death row at @entity0 's maximum security prison , the largest prison in the nation			0
the @entity1 , or @entity1 , is the size of @entity19 and surrounded on three sides by the @entity21			0
unlike the 3,300 inmates awaiting execution nationwide -- including the 94 other men at @entity1 -- @entity6 , 43 , is a convicted rapist			1
the victim was his 8 - year - old stepdaughter			1
for the first time in 44 years , a state is preparing to execute a man for a felony other than murder			1
the @entity32 @entity31 will hear arguments wednesday on whether @entity0 can use capital punishment in child rape cases			1
the constitutional question before the justices is whether the death penalty for violent crimes other than homicide constitutes " cruel and unusual " punishment			2
the high - profile examination of the death penalty also raises anew a national debate over selective prosecution and race			0
" a lot of people think there should not be the death penalty [ in this case ] because the child survives , " said @entity47 , a sex crimes prosecutor in @entity12			0
" in my opinion the rape of a child is more heinous and more hideous than a homicide			2
" @entity6 's appellate attorney , @entity58 , argues , " when we look at what it means to be cruel and unusual , this is exactly the kind of thing that raises these serious concerns of the constitutionality of mr. @entity6 's death sentence			1
" @entity6 was sentenced to die in 2003 for sexually assaulting his stepdaughter in her bed			1
the crime occurred in a quiet neighborhood in @entity72 , across the big river from @entity12			2
besides severe emotional trauma , @entity0 prosecutors said the attack caused internal injuries and bleeding to the child , requiring extensive surgery			0
the former moving company driver had claimed two teenage boys committed the crime near the family 's garage , a story the girl -- identified in court papers as " @entity89 " -- repeated for 18 months after the ordeal			2
an @entity92 teenager was initially arrested , based on @entity6 's allegations , but later was cleared of any wrongdoing			1
@entity6 also is african - american			1
police in @entity97 quickly turned their suspicions on him as the attacker			0
the girl later accused her stepfather , after she returned home from a temporary stay in foster care			0
@entity6 has denied the charges , but the state supreme court upheld the conviction and punishment			1
the @entity32 @entity31 , both in 1976 and a year later , banned capital punishment for rape -- and by implication any other crime except murder			1
but @entity0 19 years later passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12			2
state lawmakers contended the earlier high court cases pertained only to " adult women			2
" death penalty opponents say @entity0 is the only state to actively pursue lethal injection for child rapists , and argue , among other things , that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims			1
" if they 're going to face the death penalty for raping a child , why would they leave a living witness ? " said @entity129 , executive director of the @entity130 against sexual assaults			2
@entity129 also says testifying in a death penalty case can be deeply traumatic for child			0
and the risk of wrongful prosecution may be higher is such cases since children might prove to be unreliable witnesses for the prosecution , because of their susceptibility to suggestive , leading questions			0
no one in the @entity32 has been executed for rape since 1964			1
other state and federal crimes theoretically eligible for execution include treason , aggravated kidnapping , drug trafficking , aircraft hijacking and espionage			1
none of these crimes have been prosecuted as a capital offense in decades , if ever			2
in the appeal filed with the high court , @entity58 argues @entity0 " flouts the overwhelming national consensus that capital punishment is an inappropriate penalty for any kind of rape			1
" the law 's supporters counter that besides murder , no crime is more deserving of the death penalty , and the punishment would be used only in the most heinous of circumstances			1
for its victims , " it takes away their innocence , it takes away their childhood , it mutilates their spirit			0
they 're never the same after these things happen , " said @entity182 , an assistant district attorney in @entity12			0
" @entity0 has been a pro-death penalty state for a very long time , " the prosecutor added			2
" and i think a lot of people agree with the death penalty for this type of case here in our state			2
" five other states have similar laws			0
four of them -- @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 -- have had them for years but not applied them in decades			0
@entity204 enacted its version in june , but no defendant has yet been designated death - eligible for child rape in any state but @entity0			1
skin color has also played a role in the political and legal debate over expanding capital crimes to include rape			1
" when we look at the death penalty in the @entity201 we always need to be conscious of the role that race plays , " said @entity58 , deputy director at the @entity216 , which represents all the state 's death row inmates			2
" and i think that the fact that mr. @entity6 [ is ] a black from @entity97 , a place with a troubling record of racial discrimination , i think that that speaks volumes			1
" @entity58 cites @entity229 statistics showing that all 14 rapists executed by @entity0 in the past 75 years were african - american			0
nationwide from 1930 to 1964 , nearly 90 percent of executed rapists were black , he said			0
@entity6 recently was joined on @entity0 's death row by another child rapist -- @entity235 , who is white			1
@entity235 ' legal appeals have barely begun			0
the justices will no doubt consider loneliness of @entity0 's aggressive position when deciding whether a national consensus now exists to allow a broader range of crimes to become subject to capital punishment			1
the high court has in recent years banned execution for the mentally retarded , underage killers and those receiving an inadequate defense at trial			0
@entity1 prison officials would not make @entity6 available for comment			2
the youngster at the center of the case is now in college and wants to be a lawyer			0
her family says that like most underage victims , she has been scarred forever , and they believe her assailant deserves the jury 's punishment			0
" it 's going to be justice , " said @entity262 , the victim 's cousin			0
" it 's going to be that she can look forwards and not backwards , and not have to look over your shoulders , and one day see him			0
or see him coming after her			0
" a ruling from the high court is expected by late june			0
