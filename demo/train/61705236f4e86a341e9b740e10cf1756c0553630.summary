@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 won a major upset victory in tuesday 's special election for the @entity8 seat formerly held by liberal democrat @entity9			1
@entity3 defeated @entity0 attorney general @entity10 , the @entity11 candidate			1
@entity3 's victory made real the once unthinkable prospect of a @entity4 filling the seat held by @entity9 , known as the liberal lion , for almost 47 years until his death from brain cancer in august			1
voters across @entity0 braved winter cold and snow for an election with high stakes -- the domestic agenda of president @entity24 , including his priority of health care reform			1
@entity3 's victory strips @entity27 of the 60 - seat @entity8 supermajority needed to overcome @entity4 filibusters against future @entity8 action on a broad range of @entity34 priorities			1
@entity27 needed all 60 votes in their caucus to pass the health care bill , and the loss of one seat imperils generating that support again for a compromise measure worked out with the @entity34			2
in a subdued concession speech , @entity10 said she expected a tough assessment of her loss and lots of " wednesday - morning quarterbacking " after losing a seat held by @entity27 for more than 50 years			1
" i am heartbroken at the result , " @entity10 said , later adding : " although i am very disappointed , i always respect the voters ' choice			0
" @entity0 secretary of state @entity50 said last week that certifying tuesday 's election results could take more than two weeks -- potentially enough time to allow congressional democrats to pass a final health care bill before @entity3 is seated			1
but multiple @entity11 sources said this is unlikely			0
even if @entity34 and @entity8 @entity27 could reach a deal to meld their bills and pass them in the next couple of weeks , there would be a huge outcry from not only @entity4 , but also an increasingly distrustful public if they appeared to be rushing it through			1
@entity50 had predicted as many as 2.2 million of the state 's 4.5 million registered voters would vote -- at least double the turnout from december 's primary			0
in one sign of high interest , more than 100,000 absentee ballots were requested ahead of the election , according to @entity50 's spokesman , @entity73			0
@entity10 was initially expected to easily win the race to replace @entity9 , who made health care reform the centerpiece of his @entity8 career			1
until recently , @entity3 was underfunded and unknown statewide			0
in addition , no @entity4 has won a @entity8 race in @entity0 since 1972 , and @entity27 control the governorship , both houses of the state legislature , and the state 's entire congressional delegation			1
however , @entity3 surged in the weeks preceding tuesday 's vote and led in all the final polls			2
@entity11 sources told @entity2 that @entity10 called @entity3 on tuesday night to concede			1
in a sign of the high stakes involved , the @entity10 campaign held an afternoon news conference tuesday to complain that voters in three places received ballots already marked for @entity3			1
@entity96 : send us your thoughts on the special election @entity73 confirmed that the secretary of state 's offices received two reports of voters saying they got pre-marked ballots			0
the suspect ballots were invalidated and the voters received new ballots , @entity73 said			0
@entity109 , the @entity10 campaign manager , said the " disturbing incidents " raised questions about the integrity of the election			0
in response , the @entity3 campaign issued a statement criticizing @entity10 's team			1
" reports that the @entity10 campaign is making reckless accusations regarding the integrity of today 's election is a reminder that they are a desperate campaign , " @entity118 , the counsel for the @entity3 campaign , said in the statement			1
@entity24 has been both " surprised and frustrated " by the race , @entity34 press secretary @entity127 said tuesday			1
@entity24 and former president @entity129 hit the campaign trail over the past three days in an attempt to save @entity10 's campaign , which observers say was hampered by complacency and missteps			1
@entity24 crushed sen. @entity136 in @entity0 in 2008 , beating the @entity4 presidential nominee by 26 points			1
" if you were fired up in the last election , i need you more fired up in this election , " @entity24 urged a crowd at a @entity10 campaign rally on sunday			1
@entity144 , the late senator 's widow , called on state democrats to turn out to save her husband 's legacy			0
" we need your help			0
we need you to get out there and vote on tuesday , " @entity9 said			0
" we need you to bring your neighbors			0
we need you to bring your friends			0
" @entity3 , who has trumpeted his 30 years of service in the @entity156 , hewed to traditional @entity4 themes at the end of the campaign			2
he promised at a rally sunday that , if elected , he would back tax cuts and be tougher on terrorists than @entity10			0
he also repeated a pledge to oppose @entity24 's health care reform effort			2
" @entity0 wants real reform and not this trillion - dollar @entity24 health care that is being forced on the @entity168 people , " he said			1
" as the 41st [ @entity4 ] senator i will make sure that we do it better			0
" forty - four percent of @entity0 voters cited the economy and jobs as their top concern in a recent 7 news / @entity177 poll			2
thirty - eight percent mentioned health care as their top concern			0
voters more concerned with the economy were split almost evenly between the two candidates ; voters more worried about health care narrowly supported @entity10			0
@entity3 's surprising strength came in part because some independents and conservatives who have supported democrats in the past were having second thoughts			2
@entity27 far outnumber @entity4 in @entity0 , but there are more independents than @entity27 and @entity4 combined			2
several @entity11 sources say multiple @entity24 advisers have told the party they believed @entity10 was going to lose , despite @entity24 's campaign appearance for @entity10 on sunday			1
facing the possibility of @entity10 's defeat , @entity27 were trying to figure out if they could pass health care reform without that crucial 60th @entity8 vote			1
the seat is currently held by former @entity9 aide and longtime friend @entity203 , who was appointed to the seat on an interim basis			2
two @entity11 sources in close contact with the @entity34 told @entity2 on monday they 've urged the administration , in the event of a @entity3 victory , to push @entity34 @entity27 to pass the @entity8 's health care bill as currently written			1
doing so would prevent the plan from having to be taken up by the @entity8 again			0
" i think the @entity8 bill clearly is better than nothing , " @entity34 majority leader @entity214 , @entity215 , said tuesday			2
a third option would be for @entity27 to revisit the idea of trying to push health care through the @entity8 with only 51 votes -- a simple majority			2
but to do that @entity27 would have to use a process known as reconciliation , which presents technical and procedural issues that would delay the process for a long time			0
a number of @entity27 are eager to put the health care debate behind them and move on to economic issues such as job creation as soon as possible this election year			0
@entity27 could also try again to get moderate @entity4 sen. @entity234 of @entity235 to vote for a compromise health reform plan			2
multiple @entity11 sources , however , have said they believe that is unlikely now			0
@entity2 's @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
