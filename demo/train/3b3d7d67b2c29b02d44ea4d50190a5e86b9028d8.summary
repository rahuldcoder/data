@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prime minister @entity3 announced wednesday he had divorced his wife of less than two weeks , claiming that a " greater and thicker plot " had undermined his confidence in the relationship			1
" this relationship has been irretrievably damaged to a point where marriage is now inconceivable , " said @entity3 , 59 , in a statement released late wednesday , referring to the traditional marriage he had with 39 - year - old @entity10 since november 18			1
" i was well - meaning and had good intentions to rebuild my family and start a new lease of life following the tragic passing on of my wife on 6 march 2009 , " @entity3 's statement said			1
but since the day he paid lobola -- money a prospective husband pays the family of his bride -- " everything has been played in the press and i have become an innocent bystander in what is supposed to be my relationship			0
i have become a spectator in this relationship and things are happening too fast , on camera and without my knowledge			0
this has led me to conclude that there is a greater and thicker plot around this issue which has undermined my confidence in this relationship			2
" since the announcement of the marriage -- for which @entity3 reportedly paid $ 36,000 -- state and social media has been stalking @entity10			1
some media reports said she was already pregnant with twins			0
earlier in the day , president @entity48 , who formed a coalition government with @entity3 , appealed to the media to respect his prime minister 's private life			1
" everyone has a right to do what he wishes			0
but this one ( @entity3 ) is being targeted and mobbed by the media every day			2
please leave him alone , " @entity48 told journalists			2
@entity3 's first wife died in 2009 in a car accident in which the former opposition leader survived with minor injuries			1
" sometimes when you are searching for a partner especially after losing your wife , there are many stakeholders in the process some of whom have their own ulterior intentions			0
having been married for 31 years , the tendency is to want to use your experience as a yardstick for future relationships			0
regrettably , the individuals , like the one in question , may not meet the same standards , " added @entity3 without explaining			2
he said the intention of those who worked against his marriage is to " inflict maximum damage on my person and character for political gain			0
" " the ' marriage ' has been hijacked and there is an apparent active political hand that is now driving the processes			0
state security agents have also weighed in to force and direct proceedings which has resulted in everything regarding this relationship now taking place in camera , with the public media journalists in tow , " the prime minister 's statement said .			1
