it was called the trial of the century and the first true reality show			1
@entity4 went on trial for the killings of his ex-wife , @entity8 , and her friend @entity9 20 years ago , in what would become a wall - to - wall televised proceeding			1
the heavy coverage started even before the trial began			1
@entity8 's infamous slow - speed chase days after the slayings played out on tv screens across the country , and the original grand jury was dismissed due to excessive media coverage			1
here are six unforgettable moments that helped shape the trial			1
a juror is caught on camera , but @entity25 says cameras can stay on the first day of the @entity8 trial , and as defense attorney @entity28 prepared to delivered his opening statement , a camera in the courtroom captured the face of a juror			1
the juror was on camera for less than a second , but judge @entity25 had previously assured jurors that they would not be photographed or shown to the public			1
@entity25 delayed the trial , meaning the defense could not immediately follow the prosecution 's opening statement			1
after a hearing , @entity25 allowed cameras to stay in the courtroom			0
@entity46 testifies @entity8 's older sister , @entity46 , testified that her sister was an abused wife			1
in february 1995 , she said @entity8 grabbed @entity8 's crotch one night in a bar in full view of friends and strangers and proclaimed , in part , " this is mine			1
" @entity46 also recounted an incident at the @entity8 residence in which an allegedly enraged @entity4 threw @entity8 against a wall , destroyed some items from the house and threw both sisters out			1
after @entity46 completed her emotional testimony , defense attorney @entity64 countered with a completely different image of @entity8 as a warm family man , pointing to video of @entity8 showing affection with the @entity46 family just hours before the slayings			0
@entity71 asks @entity25 to declare @entity72 a hostile witness @entity4 's former houseguest @entity74 took the witness stand and displayed the flamboyant style that had made him a minor celebrity in the case			1
his version of events seemed to contradict @entity8 's story , and he testified that he could not account for @entity8 's whereabouts during the hours the prosecution said the killings took place			1
his sarcastic and evasive testimony seemed to frustrate deputy district attorney @entity71			0
on march 21 , @entity74 sparked laughter in the courtroom when @entity89 asked him if he was nervous			0
he uttered , " feeling great			0
" he then said he was " a little " nervous , @entity90 reported at the time			0
when @entity89 implied that @entity74 moved into @entity8 's guest house to promote his own acting career , @entity74 told her , " i do n't think we were going for the same parts			1
" @entity95 up , @entity89 had him declared a hostile witness , allowing her to ask him leading questions usually saved for cross-examination			0
detective @entity99 pleads the 5th -- again and again and again former @entity103 police detective @entity99 invoked his @entity105 protection against self - incrimination and refused to answer questions from defense attorney @entity108 regarding whether the testimony he gave at the preliminary hearing was completely truthful or whether he had ever falsified a police report			0
@entity99 had given testimony about the police investigation of the @entity8 residence			0
he also found the infamous bloody glove			0
the defense tried to paint @entity99 as a racist who planted the glove to frame @entity8 , which played a major role in defining the trial as about race			2
@entity99 testified he had not used the n - word in the last 10 years and branded anyone who said he had as a liar , but he later pleaded no contest to perjury charges			2
he is now a forensic and crime scene expert for @entity129			0
" if it does n't fit , you must acquit " the rhyme became @entity28 's mantra as he tried to convince jurors that the case laid out by prosecutors was inconsistent and full of holes			2
although @entity28 uttered the famous phrase , it was actually @entity108 who came up with it			0
@entity28 also colorfully illustrated his theme by donning a black knit cap similar to the one prosecutors claimed @entity8 wore as a disguise the night of the killings			0
later he pulled on a pair of gloves similar to those the prosecution used to try to link @entity8 to the crime scene			0
earlier in the trial , @entity8 had been asked to try on the gloves by prosecutor @entity153 , and they did not fit			2
" not guilty " @entity8 is acquitted flanked by @entity28 and longtime friend and attorney @entity156 , @entity8 stood and faced the jury as a court clerk read two " not guilty " verdicts on october 3 , 1995			0
members of @entity8 's family cried tears of joy in the courtroom as the family of murder victim @entity9 wept just a few feet away			2
the moment was the third most " universally impactful " televised moment of the last 50 years -- behind the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and @entity168 in 2005 -- according to a survey by @entity170 and @entity171			2
testimony in the trial took about nine months , encompassing about 120 witnesses , 45,000 pages of evidence and 1,100 exhibits .			2

it 's been 20 years since the @entity4 trial
key moments from the trial are still ingrained in the public 's memory
the reading of the verdict was one of the most watched events in history
