-- after a year where football 's name has been dragged through the mud by a series of racism controversies , @entity1 has announced that players and officials will face a 10 - match ban if found guilty of racist abuse			1
following a meeting of @entity1 's executive committee in @entity16 thursday , the @entity13 governing body confirmed the bans would apply to its own competitions , while other national associations remain free to decide on their own punishments			1
the new tougher sanction comes just over a week after the @entity22 drew criticism for its plans to introduce a minimum five - match suspension for racism			0
" an association should adopt the same or similar measures			2
@entity1 has always acted in a way to try to convince people rather than impose , " said @entity1 general secretary @entity29 at a press conference			1
" i do n't think you measure the way of fighting against racism in one simple measure and sanction			0
" the way i read the @entity22 's decision is that it could be five matches and it could also be 15			2
the @entity22 is sure their way of regulating is more correct for @entity43			0
" it 's their decision but it does n't mean they do more or less than us			2
everyone has to do what they can do in this field			0
" the @entity22 is autonomous and knows best what is best for @entity43 to do in the fight against racism			0
it is probably one of the countries where the most has been done			0
" according to details released by @entity1 , clubs and national side 's whose fans are found guilty of racist abuse will be punished with a partial stadium closure as a first offense , while a second offense will lead to a complete closure			1
only last week , @entity70 striker @entity69 told @entity0 that he was prepared to walk off the pitch if racially abused once again			0
the @entity73 striker was subjected to " monkey chants " by visiting fans during @entity70 's goalless draw with @entity77 at the @entity78			2
" i always said that if it ( racism ) happened in the stadium i will just do like ' nobody says nothing and i do n't care , ' " @entity69 told @entity0			0
" but this time i think i 've changed my mind a little bit			0
if it 's going to happen one more time , then i 'm going to leave the pitch because it 's so stupid			2
" @entity69 is not the first player to have suffered racial abuse while playing for @entity70 -- one of the most revered clubs in @entity1 having won 18 league titles and seven @entity94			1
in january , midfielder @entity95 walked off the pitch in disgust after being racially abused by a section of supporters during a friendly game at @entity101			0
since then , @entity1 has stated its intention to introduce stricter punishments for those found guilty of racism after being heavily criticized in the past for being too lenient			1
the new rules are intended to curb racism at clubs such as @entity111 club @entity110 , which has been charged four times by @entity1 so far this season , with the @entity111 side paying $ 300,000 in fines			1
@entity1 's governing body also plans to introduce the implementation of biological passports for players in the future			1
biological profiles are built up by collating an athlete 's drug test results over time , therefore making it easier to detect differences which could indicate the use of a banned substance			0
a new @entity1 anti-doping program will also examine 900 samples given in the past five years to decipher whether steroids have been used			2
on friday , @entity1 is expected to announce changes to the @entity132 with the winner set to be granted a place in the @entity135 from 2015			1
meanwhile , @entity137 's @entity136 will host the 2015 @entity135 final , while @entity139 will welcome the finalists of the @entity132 .			1
