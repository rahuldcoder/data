-- from the results of the @entity4 hacking competition , it looks like @entity5 and @entity6 are tough nuts to crack			1
it took only two days for hackers to crack into the @entity10 and @entity11 operating systems during the three - day @entity4 tournament last week , while @entity5 and @entity6 7 models were abandoned and left unhacked by the end of the contest			1
is this because their operating systems are more secure ? yes and no. " the survival of a target at @entity4 does not automatically declare it safer than a target that went down , " last year 's @entity20 winner @entity19 cautions			1
the contestants who were lined up to beat the @entity5 and @entity27 devices in the competition withdrew for a variety of reasons			1
@entity4 , now in its fifth year , is a hacking competition divided into two areas : web browsers and mobile phones			1
this year , @entity39 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38 were the web - browser targets			0
in the mobile phone category , the @entity41 ( @entity6 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity44 ( @entity11 6 ) and @entity45 ( @entity5 ) were targeted			1
the os and browser versions were frozen last week ( so for example , @entity10 's @entity50 update was not used ) , ensuring that all contestants are working on the same version of each os. pwning and owning occurs if the hacker defeats the frozen version			2
if the exploit they used still exists in the current firmware , they are also eligible to receive a monetary prize			0
the 2011 @entity4 competition ran march 9 to 11			1
@entity19 says many different factors determine how hard a target is to hack			0
there 's the safety of the software itself , the exploit mitigations that are already in place for that software , and then the amount of research that has already been conducted ( which can speed up the process of writing an actual exploit )			0
@entity37 and @entity38 web browsers were also left undefeated because contestants withdrew from @entity4			2
" @entity38 has the advantages of having multiple exploit - mitigation techniques that certainly make it more difficult to hack			0
as for @entity5 , we see no particular reason why @entity5 would be harder to hack than one of the other targets			2
" @entity50 , @entity38 , @entity42 , @entity5 and @entity11 all use @entity85 in their browsers , which means that they are all susceptible to exploitation through the browser -- and that 's exactly how the @entity42 and @entity11 were attacked			1
@entity90 , a @entity4 veteran , worked with @entity91 to hack the iphone 4 in this year 's competition using a flaw in its @entity88 and a " specially - crafted webpage			2
" a team of 3 ( @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 ) defeated the @entity100 using a similar technique			0
so what did the contest 's organizers think of the outcome of 2011 's @entity4 ? @entity19 and other organizers were not surprised that the @entity42 went down quickly			2
it has been a major target and a lot of research has already been done on that platform			0
@entity5 's survival was a bit of a surprise , since it is also a big target and had four contestants lined up			1
although no device is unhackable , some factors contribute to a safer product			0
for those that are out to find the safest phone on the market , @entity19 says you 'll want to compare features such as @entity126 ( @entity126 ) , @entity127 ( address space layout randomization ) , @entity129 , code signing and the ease with which software can be updated on the device			0
