-- for a few days there , it looked as if the typographical error was finally going to get its moment in the sun. the lowly typo -- a hastily pecked keystroke with a bad result -- has long been regarded as an irritation , a sloppy glitch , a skimmed - over eyesore			1
it 's really much more than that , which we will delve into in a few paragraphs			1
but first , the typo 's blown opportunity to gain worldwide stature : when the financial markets were on the verge of a nervous breakdown this month , on the day the @entity24 industrial average plummeted almost 1,000 points in 15 minutes , analysts and regulators immediately , frantically , started looking for a reason			1
nothing on this scale had ever happened before			2
who or what was responsible ? initially , suspicions centered on the " fat - finger theory			2
" what this meant was that a trader with a symbolically fat finger ( meaning a careless one ) had purportedly entered a computer - ordered sale of billions of shares of stocks ; the theory was that when he had meant to type in " million , " he instead typed in " billion			1
" if this was so , it would have been the typographical error of all time : the @entity49 / @entity48 / @entity47 of typos			1
if one keystroke could put the world 's economy on the brink of collapse , this would mean that a typo could be as powerful as an atomic bomb			1
by the end of last week , it was looking as if the fat - finger typo might not be the culprit			1
@entity63 , the chairwoman of the @entity64 , told @entity65 that while no cause for the financial plunge could be definitively ruled out , the typo - as - @entity66 was increasingly appearing to be an unlikely explanation			1
if a typo had been shown to have that kind of muscle , maybe the societal trend to regard typos as no big deal might have been reversed			1
in our computer - screen age , typos -- and their cousins , misspellings and grammatical errors -- have been given a reprieve			1
what once prompted people to shake their heads in stern disapproval when it appeared on newspaper or magazine pages -- a flat - out mistake , caused by lazy typing and indifferent proofreading -- produces not as much of a stir when seen on a glowing screen			2
the theory seems to be that , in e-mails and instant messages and various other forms of digital discourse , speed counts for more than accuracy , and those whose blood pressures rise when they see such typos are stodgy , ancient , out of touch			1
the contemporary attitude is : who cares if a few words are mistyped ? but it 's a matter of discipline			1
it 's a matter of diligence			1
you may have heard the wonderful story in recent days about what happened when @entity0 senior producer @entity118 was walking to work at the network 's @entity121 bureau			1
@entity118 was striding along the @entity123 , as he does each morning en route to the office , when he glanced down at a newly installed pink stone star on the sidewalk			1
it was a star that was going to be introduced to the public that very day			2
it was intended to honor the actress @entity132			0
except the name on the star was : @entity134			0
no " o " in @entity135			0
@entity118 , who told me he takes pride in being a longtime copy editor , could not simply walk on by			1
dismayed , he stared at the star			0
" i 'm one of those annoying people who notices typos on restaurant menus , " he told me			2
" annoying ? " hardly			0
when it comes to words , he 's a stickler , which is a fine thing to be			2
what he did next has elevated him into contention for patron saint of sticklers : he phoned in a correction			0
he could n't let this pass			0
he called the people who run the @entity123 , told them about their typo that was set in stone and made certain the star got fixed			1
" i ca n't help it , " he told me			0
" i go crazy when i see missing apostrophes			0
" he was preaching to the choir			0
my own obsessed - proofreader story is not quite as good as @entity118 's , but it establishes us as kindred spirits			1
some years ago , during my first and only visit to @entity167 in @entity168 , i was with some friends watching the @entity170 play the @entity171 in a night game			1
@entity173 of the @entity171 , who would go on to be voted into the @entity174 , came up to bat			0
in @entity167 there was a huge video screen behind center field , and as each batter came to the plate a gigantic color photo of him appeared on the screen , accompanied by his name			0
@entity173 's smiling face was up on the screen , all right			2
so was the name , in huge letters visible all over the stadium : " @entity173			0
i knew i should n't say anything			0
i knew , in the scheme of all the world 's woes , it would make no difference			2
i knew i should just sit back and enjoy the ball game on a lovely , warm evening			0
but i could n't help myself			0
i sought out a front - office executive of the @entity170			1
" look , " i said , pointing to the outfield			0
" what 's wrong ? " he said			1
it took him about 15 seconds to figure it out			0
" oh , my , " he said			0
that night was my version of the @entity132 star			0
at @entity173 's next at - bat , @entity173 became @entity173			2
a small victory for precision , perhaps			0
but we all take such victories where we find them			0
i half - wish that it had , indeed , been a typo that sent the @entity24 into that tailspin			2
it would have imbued typos with the seriousness they deserve , and would have been an inspiring triumph for sticklers everywehre			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1

the societal trend to regard typos as no big deal is wrong , says @entity221
@entity221 : in computer age , typos , misspellings , grammatical errors are given a reprieve
@entity0 's @entity118 noticed @entity123 typo ; @entity221 *spotted* @entity170 typo
