@entity0 -- president @entity3 will use a major speech this week on the @entity5 to reaffirm basic @entity7 principles and policies regarding the region while also toughening his administration 's stance against @entity13 's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators , administration officials said monday			1
the speech thursday at the @entity16 also will address the ongoing fight against @entity18 following the may 2 killing of its leader , @entity20 , as well as the current status of the @entity25 - @entity24 conflict , said the officials , who spoke on condition of not being identified			2
last week , @entity29 press secretary @entity28 told reporters that @entity3 's address will be a " fairly sweeping and comprehensive " take on the events that have upended governments in @entity34 and @entity35 and pushed other countries to take steps toward reform			1
the speech comes nearly two years after a 2009 address in @entity41 , the @entity35 capital , that called for " a new beginning " between the @entity7 and the @entity44 world			1
this time , the @entity45 that has launched demonstrations throughout @entity47 and the @entity5 provides the backdrop as @entity3 continues to enjoy a domestic political uplift from the successful @entity7 mission to eliminate @entity20 at his compound in @entity52			1
what 's next for the @entity45 according to the administration officials , major themes of the speech will focus on how change in the @entity5 region came from the people who live there and provided them with an opportunity to gain a say in their future governance , and that the @entity7 can not impose change but will uphold principles such as freedom of assembly , the right to self - determination and respect for human rights			1
@entity3 also will address situations in specific countries , and is expected to come out strong against @entity13 president @entity76 's violent response to protesters in his country , the officials said			1
they expect additional @entity7 sanctions on @entity13 to be announced before the speech and said the new measures could target @entity76 by name			1
report : @entity84 sending banned weapons to @entity13 other countries likely to be mentioned by name include @entity89 and @entity90 , but not with the same level of criticism as directed at @entity13 , the administration officials said			1
@entity3 also will talk about how the @entity5 protesters are demonstrating for freedom and democracy , rather than the @entity97 ideology			2
on sunday , former national intelligence director @entity98 said that the speech will give @entity3 a chance to restate @entity7 backing for the outpouring of support for the @entity45			1
" i think it brings us the opportunity to get on the right side of history , the things we believe in , " @entity98 said			0
" @entity45 is not just about @entity25 , it is about freedom and democracy			0
and i think that sentiment is very powerful , plays to our strengths and we should be strongly in favor of that			0
" the @entity3 administration helped prod former @entity35 president @entity117 to leave office in february after the country 's military establishment refused to crush a popular uprising against his nearly 30 - year rule			2
@entity7 forces took part in the @entity126 air campaign against @entity127 , where the allies have called for @entity127 leader @entity129 to yield to an armed rebellion and leave power after nearly 42 years			2
arrest warrants sought for @entity129 @entity0 slapped sanctions on top @entity13 officials after a violent crackdown on pro-reform protests there			1
but the clampdown on demonstrators and activists in @entity89 , a key @entity7 ally in the @entity142 , has drawn only verbal protests from @entity7 officials			1
" they are bottling up forces which will eventually push them out , " @entity98 said			0
" so i think that what the @entity7 does is to encourage that in general , and then we support specifically where we can			2
" while @entity3 's @entity41 speech of 2009 was well - received , a feeling persists in the region that @entity7 policy in reaction to the @entity45 has been inconsistent			1
expectations therefore are high for @entity3 to this time lay out a clear and strong statement of intent and action rather than general platitudes and half - measures that fail to materialize			2
@entity98 served as director of national intelligence until may 2010 , when he resigned after finding himself at odds with the @entity29 and others in the intelligence community during his 16 - month tenure			0
his predecessor , @entity169 , said sunday that other players , including the @entity171 and the international community , will have to " step up " to support reform if it is going to succeed			0
" the @entity127 case , i think , is instructive in that regard because you will recall that president @entity3 stipulated that there needed to be more unilateral and @entity185 engagement in that situation , " said @entity169 , who also served as @entity7 ambassador to @entity176 under the @entity178 administration			1
" and i think ditto with respect to @entity13			2
" @entity189 analyst @entity188 told @entity1 's " @entity191 " sunday that @entity3 realizes the @entity7 is " politically indispensable " to creating a broad coalition			1
" but once we 've done that , his idea is we should n't be the global policeman , " said @entity188 , a former top @entity16 official			0
" other countries have a really strong stake in these outcomes , and we should be willing to share responsibility with them			0
" meanwhile , @entity169 said an @entity25 - @entity24 peace deal is needed for @entity25 , a key @entity7 ally , " to be viable over the long term			2
" though those efforts are currently stalled , " we can never take it completely off the table , " he said			0
deadly clashes mark @entity25 's founding the administration 's @entity5 special envoy , former sen. @entity209 , resigned last week after two years leading efforts to resolve the decades - old @entity25 - @entity24 conflict			0
ongoing @entity25 settlement construction in the occupied @entity224 , the @entity214 's efforts to reconcile the feud between the @entity217 and @entity218 factions that rule different @entity24 territories and @entity24 steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart during that period			0
@entity226 , a former @entity227 diplomat and ambassador to @entity0 , told " gps " that other countries will be watching the @entity7 closely because of the global reach of the @entity7			0
" they 'll always look at both @entity7 rhetoric and @entity7 deeds , " @entity226 said			0
" @entity7 power is present everywhere			0
" @entity1 's @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this story .			0
