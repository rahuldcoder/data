-- everyone knows @entity2 as the buzzy island city home to over seven million people perpetually on the move			1
but it may be a surprise to learn that many of the residents in this bustling city do n't spend much time foraging in their pockets for change , especially on public transport			1
instead , they whip out their @entity16 , a contactless smart card with a chip that communicates with a fare processor in less than a second			1
it has been in use in @entity2 since 1997			1
according to the company , around 95 percent of people in @entity2 between the ages of 16 - 65 have an octopus card , and their transactions add up to about 18 million dollars every day			1

another new venture is that @entity16 has recently partnered with @entity61 , @entity63 's e-commerce answer to @entity64 or @entity65			2
