@entity0 -- to president @entity4 and @entity6 allies in @entity7 , sunday 's secession referendum in @entity3 is unconstitutional , illegal and a fraud because @entity10 troops have essentially taken over the southern @entity12 peninsula			1
to @entity10 president @entity14 , it is a chance for @entity3 residents to decide if they want to realign their region with @entity17 after the political strife in @entity12 that ousted the @entity20 leader last month			1
whatever the outcome , the vote planned by @entity3 's regional parliament and endorsed by @entity10 's government will further inflame the @entity12 crisis as the @entity6 and @entity26 seek a diplomatic solution while threatening diplomatic and political sanctions			1
here are some of the biggest questions about the issue , with a look at how key players are weighing in : 1 ) what is the @entity3 referendum ? voters in the autonomous @entity12 region of about 2 million people will choose between asserting independence from the former @entity41 republic or joining neighboring @entity10			1
there is no option for the status quo -- remaining a part of @entity12			0
voters must be older than 18 and bring @entity48 documents to show they are a resident of @entity3 in order to cast a ballot			0
officials say voters can expect to see members of the local electoral commission and observers at their allocated polling station , which will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time			0
results are expected monday and @entity6 officials have made clear they expect @entity3 voters to choose to become part of @entity10			1
the referendum follows the lightning chain of events in @entity12 in recent months that included increasingly violent protests against the government , the country 's @entity20 president fleeing across the border , and then @entity10 troops seizing what amounts to military control of @entity3 -- where @entity10 's @entity75 fleet is based			1
by unanimously backing the referendum , the @entity3 parliament signaled the intentions of regional leaders as well as @entity10 to restore the territory to @entity17 's control			2
@entity12 's interim government insists @entity3 is part of the country , a stance supported by the @entity6 and its @entity7 allies			1
disturbing tales emerge from @entity3 2 ) is it legal ? depends on who you ask			0
in @entity12 , the interim government rejects the referendum as unconstitutional , while many in the @entity93 desire the chance to again align with @entity17			2
@entity10 says the political upheaval in @entity12 that forced out president @entity96 ended the @entity99 government 's constitutional authority			1
@entity10 president @entity14 calls the ousting of @entity96 an anti-constitutional coup , and he argues the people of @entity3 should have the right to decide their future in the same way as other autonomous regions , such as @entity108 's breakaway from @entity109			1
however , @entity4 and @entity7 leaders insist the @entity3 referendum would violate the @entity12 constitution and international law			1
@entity114 , the @entity6 ambassador to the @entity115 , told @entity1 last week that the @entity12 constitution requires territorial referendums to be held " across the entirety of @entity12 and not just in a sub-region like this			0
" she argued that @entity96 fled of his own volition , and that constitutional authority agreed to in a february 21 deal he reached with opposition leaders and @entity7 envoys remained in effect			1
under that agreement , @entity12 will elect a new government on may 25 for the entire country , including @entity3			2
@entity10 @entity130 backs @entity3 vote , brushes off sanctions threat 3 ) what would it mean ? @entity4 's quick condemnation of a @entity3 referendum showed the @entity6 expects the outcome to favor realigning with @entity10			1
the autonomous region has a 60 % ethnic @entity10 population , having been part of @entity10 until it was ceded to @entity12 in 1954 when both countries belonged to the @entity41			1
@entity114 said that if the referendum goes forward , the result would get little recognition beyond @entity10			0
that did n't matter in 2008 when @entity10 under @entity14 sent troops into neighboring @entity147 , another former @entity41 territory , to back autonomy for the @entity20 regions of @entity150 and @entity151			0
more than five years later , both territories are effectively annexed with @entity10 forces still present			0
asked if @entity3 and perhaps other parts of eastern and southern @entity12 that favor @entity10 might end up the same , @entity114 said : " i think it 's maybe not helpful to talk about precedents			2
" " we are seeking to create a future where the past is not replicated here in @entity12 , " she added			0
cyberwar hits @entity12 4 ) potential fallout ? for @entity10 , a major motivation is ensuring control of its @entity165 based in @entity166 , as well as its economic influence in @entity12 and other former @entity41 territories and satellites			0
the @entity3 referendum would provide an electoral justification for what amounts to a land grab amid @entity12 's political upheaval			2
@entity4 acknowledged @entity10 had legitimate concerns that needed to be part of a solution , such as guarantees it could maintain the @entity166 - based naval fleet in @entity12			0
however , his call for @entity10 troops in @entity3 to return to their barracks and negotiations between @entity10 and @entity12 on a solution has so far yielded little progress			2
both the @entity6 and @entity26 have threatened sanctions if no significant progress occurs soon , but major economic ties between @entity10 and @entity7 powers , such as @entity190 , raise questions about the strength of any @entity26 steps			2
secretary of state @entity194 said thursday that if the @entity3 referendum proceeds with no sign of movement by @entity10 on negotiating with @entity12 on the crisis , " there will be a very serious series of steps monday in @entity7 and here			1
" to @entity1 's @entity202 , @entity14 may get his wish with @entity3 , but at a cost			0
" they got @entity3 , but they 've scared off @entity12 , " he said			0
" and , most importantly , the people of @entity12 are now deeply suspicious of @entity10			2
the people in @entity209 and @entity210 and the @entity211 , or probably in places like @entity213 , are all now fearful			0
" @entity1 's @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0

people in @entity3 , an autonomous region of @entity12 , vote sunday on joining @entity10
the @entity6 and its @entity7 allies reject the referendum as illegal
to @entity10 , the ousting of the elected @entity12 government was illegal
at issue is whether constitutional authority exists in @entity12
