-- opener @entity1 scored a superb century as @entity2 forced their way back on the second day of the first test against @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity1 smashed 112 and featured in solid partnerships with fellow - opener @entity9 ( 35 ) and captain @entity10 ( 31 ) as @entity2 completed a day of dominance			1
fast bowler @entity12 opened a window of opportunity for the hosts by snaring @entity1 and @entity10 in successive overs in the final session , but @entity19 ( 36 not out ) and @entity18 , five from a half - century , denied the home side further inroads as @entity2 ended on 275 for three , 151 in deficit			1
@entity12 had looked menacing with the new ball , but with little assistance from the pitch , @entity2 were off to a good start and @entity1 looked comfortable			1
together with left - handed @entity9 , @entity1 added 74 for the opening wicket at a brisk pace , effectively putting the pressure back on the home side			1
@entity31 eventually severed that stand , forcing @entity9 to fend at a delivery that moved away a touch and he edged to wicketkeeper @entity35 who held an excellent catch in front of first slip			2
save for that burst from @entity12 with the new ball , @entity6 's attack had looked ordinary and it allowed @entity10 to hit his stride			1
with the @entity43 skipper holding up one end , @entity1 continued to play freely and eventually reached his 10th @entity45 -- his fifth this year -- by cutting leg - spinner @entity31 for a boundary			1
the two had added 115 for the second wicket when @entity12 produced another fine burst to snare both batsmen			0
@entity1 was tempted with a short ball , but mistimed his pull and ended up presenting @entity54 a simple catch at gully			2
@entity10 was also done by a short ball , the captain top edging to @entity58 at fine leg			0
the twin dismissal left @entity2 at 194 for three , but @entity19 and @entity18 put the visitors ' pursuit back on track			2
both batsmen began cautiously until @entity18 , who has already scored 1083 runs in eight tests in this calendar year , shed the shackles by driving @entity69 for consecutive boundaries			0
the fourth - wicket pair have so far added 81 in an unbroken stand			0
in the morning , master spinner @entity73 finished with three wickets as the hosts were bowled out in the first session			0
@entity73 , who had snared @entity77 on monday , added the wickets of tailenders @entity79 and @entity31 to his tally , while fast bowler @entity82 removed @entity54 , the batsman falling without adding to his overnight score of 177			0
@entity54 fell in the third over of the morning , @entity82 collecting his fourth wicket by bowling the batsman via an inside edge as he attempted to drive			0
@entity79 , two overnight , then added 25 for the eighth wicket with @entity12 taking @entity6 's total past the 400 - run mark in the process			1
but @entity2 's spinners made short work of the tail			2
left - arm spinner @entity96 trapped @entity12 in front , while @entity73 claimed the wickets of @entity79 and last man @entity31 to finish with a three - wicket haul .			0
