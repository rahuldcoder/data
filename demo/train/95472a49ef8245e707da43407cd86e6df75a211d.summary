now that the holidays are over , there 's a lot of activity bubbling up in the 2016 presidential race , especially on the @entity7 side			2
here 's a brief look at what 's been happening and what we can expect to see from prospective candidates in coming weeks			0
@entity13 says same - sex marriage fight already decided the state of @entity16 is gearing up to start issuing same - sex marriages as early as this week after a federal judge ruled in august that the state 's voter - approved same - sex marriage ban was unconstitutional			1
but former governor , @entity13 , said sunday the decision should have been left to the states , appearing to stand by the 2008 amendment that defines marriage as between a man and a woman			1
" it ought be a local decision			0
i mean , a state decision , " @entity13 told the @entity30			2
the people of the state decided			0
but it 's been overturned by the courts , i guess			0
" his comments were consistent with previous measured statements by @entity13 , who left office in 2007			1
as governor , he was against same - sex marriage , but he did n't try lobby too hard at the time to back the same - sex marriage amendment of 2008			1
and in 2013 , @entity13 warned in a speech that @entity47 were becoming known for being " anti-gay , " as well as " anti-immigrant , anti-woman , anti-science " and " anti-worker			2
" " the face of the @entity47 needs to be the face of every @entity53 , and we need to be the party of inclusion and acceptance , " @entity13 said at the @entity50			2
can @entity58 turn his love for the @entity60 into campaign cash ? @entity62 gov. @entity58 schmoozed with ( and bear - hugged ) @entity60 owner @entity63 in the owner 's box sunday night			1
while @entity58 has said the two have been developing a friendship over the past five years , their relationship is coming under renewed attention now that @entity58 is angling for a possible presidential bid			1
@entity58 's friendship with @entity63 could help expand his donor network in @entity74 , a state where gov. @entity75 and former @entity16 gov. @entity13 -- two potential competitors -- have deep ties to many wealthy contributors			1
asked on @entity80 's " @entity81 " radio show monday if he thinks he can carry @entity74 now , should he run for president , @entity58 joked : " i think our chances have improved			1
" he said he hopes to go to the @entity60 playoff game next weekend against the @entity87 at @entity88 in @entity89			2
asked if he 'll pay a visit to gov. @entity91 , a potential 2016 rival for the @entity47 presidential nomination , while he 's there , @entity58 said : " of course			1
@entity91 and @entity95 are friends , and i 'll see @entity91			0
" @entity58 will have to squeeze the football games into his busy schedule this month as the former @entity100 chairman travels to multiple states for gubernatorial inaugurations			2
he 's already slated to visit ceremonies in @entity16 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
he 's also attending a social conservative gathering in @entity105 on jan. 24 along with other potential 2016 @entity7 contenders			2
and on february 12 , he 's speaking at a @entity112 in the @entity114 area hosted by @entity7			0
@entity115 going to @entity105 @entity116 gov. @entity115 is n't attending the @entity105 event on jan. 24 , but he 's still grabbing some face time with @entity105 evangelical leaders when he heads to the @entity105 on tuesday			1
first reported by the @entity120 , @entity115 will meet with pastors in @entity122 and @entity120 at closed - door events sponsored by the @entity124			1
@entity115 's political spokesman said @entity115 plans to talk about the prayer and fasting event he 's leading in @entity116 on jan. 24 , the same day as the freedom summit in @entity105			1
@entity130 's wife hitting the ( @entity132 ) road @entity133 , the wife of @entity7 sen. @entity130 , is set to start her book tour of her upcoming title , " true and @entity136 , " scheduled to release in april			0
@entity130 will make multiple stops in @entity132 this week to talk about her book , a collection of essays about women , including her grandmother			0
as he gears up for a likely presidential bid , @entity130 has frequently mentioned that he 's still waiting for his wife to sign off on a @entity147 run			1
we 'll be watching this week to see if she 's asked about her husband 's aspirations			0
in august , she cautioned in a radio interview that launching a presidential campaign is " something that you do n't go into lightly			0
" " being in the public eye is hard on a family and a marriage , " she added			0
" it 's not a typical job where you just go to work and do your job , there are huge demands on your time and , obviously , there are going to be a lot of people attacking you ... and that 's part of it , that 's part of politics , but it 's on such a high scale when you 're running for president , so we 're thinking about it but not 100 % there yet obviously			0
" @entity133 , a former political consultant , has worked with her husband on speeches and other writings			0
her husband is also set to release a book this spring			0
@entity184 takes big step toward presidential bid former @entity187 gov. @entity184 announced saturday that he 's ending his weekly @entity188 to explore the idea of a presidential bid , a final decision he says he wo n't make until the spring			1
the move marked yet another serious step taken by a potential contender , following @entity13 's announcement last month that he 'd be actively exploring a bid and was stepping down from his corporate board memberships			1
a source close to @entity184 's political operation said the decision to leave @entity188 has been long in the works and argued @entity13 's timing had " zero " impact on @entity184 's strategy			1
@entity184 , who ran for president in 2008 and won the @entity105 caucuses , will spend the next few months promoting his new book and focusing on securing the financial footing that he lacked in 2008 to sustain a prolonged campaign			1
" if he decides to run this time , i think that 's something we will be able to remedy , " the source said			0
" it 's one of the things that he learned eight years ago : make sure you have the financial resources to compete			0
" he 's also attending to the @entity219 later this month and stopping in the early primary state of @entity106 for his book tour			0
@entity2 's @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
