-- @entity1 made it clear what he thought of 7 - inch tablets in october 2010			0
they 're " too small , " and as good as " dead on arrival			0
" but the announcement of and anticipation surrounding @entity11 's @entity10 tablet may soon have @entity1 eating his words			1
if you 've been living under a rock and have n't heard the news , @entity11 debuted its $ 200 7 - inch tablet , the @entity10 , this week			1
make no mistake : it 's no @entity19			2
there 's no front - facing or rear - facing camera , and it 's only got 8 gb of storage			2
but it 's not meant to be an @entity19			2
it 's a completely different kind of tablet , designed for the pure consumer			1
that is , it 's designed for consumptive behavior : reading , listening to music , watching video content			1
the lack of local storage is n't an issue , either ; it 's meant to take advantage of the cloud with services like @entity11 's $ 80 yearly prime service , as well as @entity39			1
and the smaller form factor makes it extra portable , easy to whip out on the bus or the subway ( much like a @entity10 )			1
" with a 7 - inch device , you can easily take your @entity10 with you and hold it in one hand for gaming and movie watching , " @entity11 representative @entity44 said via e-mail			1
@entity52 design consultant @entity51 thinks that 7 - inch tablets could become just as popular as larger 9.7 and 10.1 - inch tablets , " but the types of applications and the context and length of use between might be very different			0
" the @entity19 , although portable , is more difficult to manage with a single hand due to its larger size			0
and while it is certainly geared towards consumptive behavior , the @entity19 also strives to break the mobile - pc barrier by becoming a tool for creation , with programs like @entity67 for @entity19 and @entity68 for @entity19 allowing users to produce content rather than just passively take it in			0
whether it actually accomplishes that or not is subjective ( some scoff at @entity68 's limited capabilities ) , but it 's possible , and likely that more apps of this nature are in the pipeline ( third - party produced or otherwise )			0
@entity11 's decision to debut a smaller - sized tablet was likely influenced by the players in the current tablet market			1
the 7 - inch space has the least resistance , @entity83 's @entity82 says			0
its direct competition is more likely to be the @entity87 , which also runs @entity88 and touts a similar form factor , than @entity90 's @entity19			1
that 's exactly what fueled @entity96 , makers of the 7 - inch @entity88 - running @entity93 tablet , to choose that size			1
" we wanted to avoid the head - to - head comparisons to the 10 - inch @entity19 â € ” ours is a very different product that goes after a different target customer , " marketing manager @entity98 said			0
the smaller size also allowed @entity11 to more easily make a splash with a lower price point , something other 7 - inch tablet manufacturers are going to have to mimic to stay competitive			1
take @entity108 , which just dropped the price of its 7 - inch flyer tablet from an @entity19 - range $ 499 to a more affordable $ 299			2
@entity111 also jumped in on the hype , introducing its @entity113 on friday			0
if @entity111 can manage a similar price , the @entity10 could have another legitimate competitor			2
and just in case it crosses your mind , a 7 - inch tablet would not be something @entity90 would likely ever debut			0
@entity90 has been tremendously successful with its 9.7 - inch @entity19 , which flew off shelves shortly after its debut and has continued solid sales since			0
unless that changes for some reason , there is n't a need for @entity90 to break out a smaller @entity19 , economically speaking			0
it 's also not in @entity90 's dna			0
since @entity1 jumped back on board with @entity90 in the late ' 90s , @entity90 's success has hinged on innovation , rather than riding on the heels of successful consumer reaction in markets it does n't have a presence in			2
take the netbook market for example : rather than releasing a netbook , @entity90 introduced the @entity140 , and later of course , the @entity19			0
part of what 's hindered the success of the 7 - inch tablet , until now , is that they are perceived to be more like an over-sized mobile phone than a tablet , " and that appears to be the @entity149 of the mini-tablets , " @entity51 says			2
but the genius of the @entity10 is that it 's more closely identified with @entity11 's popular e-reader line than with smartphones , so it has a clearly defined place within the user 's mind			1
and now that @entity11 has made that distinction clear , other 7 - inch tablet makers can at least attempt to capitalize on that extra portable , media - consumption angle , rather than marketing them against the @entity19			1
the @entity10 's separation from both larger @entity19 - sized tablets and large - screened smartphones , both in size and in function , will help secure a solid niche for other 7 - inch tablets to follow			1
