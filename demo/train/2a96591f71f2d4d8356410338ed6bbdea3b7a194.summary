-- i had the pleasure of getting to know the @entity3 -- the duck call mogul stars of @entity6 's " @entity5 " -- over the past couple of years			1
i 've hunted ducks with @entity9 , the patriarch , and enjoyed miss @entity11 's home cooking			2
they are good , kindhearted , compassionate and generous people			0
the brouhaha over @entity15 's comments to a @entity17 reporter is disconcerting , not because i disagree with his views on homosexuality -- and i do , demonstrably -- but because his views are neither surprising nor unique			1
" @entity5 " is a show about a @entity23 family			1
they pray at the end of every episode			0
they go to church , or school as @entity9 likes to call it			0
@entity9 's son @entity30 is an evangelical pastor			0
@entity9 quotes @entity31 regularly on the show ( and in real life			1
) they do not hide their christianity , but rather they celebrate it			0
that @entity9 would therefore express a biblically literal interpretation of homosexuality may offend some , but it should n't surprise anyone			0
@entity6 has the right to its decision , but suspending @entity9 for his beliefs , even if expressed crudely , seems ungracious			1
the @entity3 ' christian values are , in large part , exactly why the show is so popular			0
millions of viewers have made it the top reality show of all time because they reject the moral bankruptcy of other reality families			0
indeed , the @entity52 has been very profitable for @entity6			1
the outrage over @entity9 's intolerance also seems blindly hypocritical			0
many of his most indignant critics , including prominent voices in the media , are the very same people who are overtly intolerant and dismissive of @entity23 , regularly condemning them as idiots , fanatics and loons			1
a colleague of mine -- someone i like very much -- once said that parents who taught their children the creation story should be charged with child abuse			0
another colleague of mine likened a @entity23 community in @entity72 to @entity73			2
i 've heard many others openly wish that anti-abortion @entity23 had been aborted			2
this is the kind of tolerance to which @entity15 should aspire ? @entity6 need not endorse @entity9 's comments , nor must we embrace them			1
but it 's unfortunate that an otherwise kind and giving family has been maligned for expressing personal views shared by many			1
reject those views , but do not reject this family			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity88 .			2

@entity88 has gotten to know the family featured in @entity6 's " @entity5 " *series*
she says they are a @entity23 family that celebrates their *religion* and @entity31
she disagrees with @entity15 's views on gays but says they *'re* not a surprise
@entity88 says @entity6 's suspension of @entity15 from show is an ungracious act
