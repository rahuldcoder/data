@entity0 , @entity1 -- storms were forecast saturday for areas already suffering from the swollen @entity5 , as @entity1 's governor urged caution			1
the rain comes as the @entity5 was cresting in @entity9 , @entity1			1
the water was cresting at 61.8 feet , or 13.8 feet above flood stage there , according to the @entity13			2
there were some early signs of recovery farther north in @entity0 , where the river had already crested , though the floodwaters are expected to remain for weeks			1
the @entity21 backwater levee near @entity0 had hit its peak , @entity2 affiliate @entity19 reported			1
" these levees are going to be more and more saturated every day			2
there will be continuing wave action up against them and so people should n't drop their guard , " gov. @entity24 told reporters in @entity26 friday			2
although many displaced residents in @entity0 are eager to return to their homes , until the water level recedes , only emergency officials will be allowed , @entity19 reported			1
" it is illegal to drive a boat in flooded areas and it will remain so until that executive order is lifted , which wo n't be soon , " @entity24 said			2
the governor also warned of health risks to both the emergency responders and residents			2
" we 've had reports of water samples where the e. coli level was 200 times normal			2
this stuff is nasty , " @entity24 said			0
the governor himself owns a lake home that has been flooded			0
the @entity5 is not expected to return to its 43 - foot flood stage in @entity0 until after june 14 , which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks , said @entity59 , a @entity13 hydrologist			1
it crested at 57.1 feet thursday			0
the river is more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927			0

and then second off , pretty much everything you would need in a home , " evacuee @entity68 told @entity2 affiliate wapt			1
@entity0 resident @entity73 told the station his home had several feet of water in it			1
" in a way , it feels like a big loss , but with @entity81 you ca n't do anything about it , " he said , @entity77 reported			1
severe storms are likely saturday and sunday in the @entity5 , @entity84 and @entity86 valleys			1

some of them are tourists			0
everybody wants to come see the water			0
" local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes			0
flooded houses pose a variety of dangers , they said			0

a slide was detected on the mainline @entity1 levee at @entity160 , the @entity161 said thursday			1
that occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded , spokeswoman @entity162 said			2
crews are working around the clock to help fill the gaps			2
if the levee fails , thousands of homes and more than one million acres would be flooded , according to @entity172 , the @entity173 's chief engineer			2
" so it 's very important we hold this levee together , " he said			2
farther south , where the @entity5 has not yet crested , residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by			0
@entity181 gov. @entity180 has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the @entity184 , where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing @entity187 farther downstream			0
