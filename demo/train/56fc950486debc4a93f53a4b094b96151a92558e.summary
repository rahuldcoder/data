-- in an age of streaming media , we 're still a culture of digital hoarders			0
that may partly explain why on tuesday , @entity7 introduced an @entity8 with 128 gigabytes of storage capacity , twice as much as any previous model			1
but will the average tablet owner need that much space ? for casual users , tablets are media - consumption devices			0
we use them to watch movies and tv shows , listen to music , play games and read books and magazines			0
all those files take up memory on your internal hard drive			0
today 's high - resolution photos and videos are increasingly hogging storage , too			2
it 's easy to see how someone with a lot of downloaded files might eventually run out of room on a @entity36 tablet			0
but 128 gigabytes ? that 's the equivalent of about 100 dvd - quality movies , 30 blu - ray movies , 30,000 songs or 40,000 photos , according to this graphic by a computer store in the @entity44			1
everything else about the @entity8 announced tuesday is the same as the current fourth - generation models : a 9.7 - inch retina display , a dual - core a6x processor , a @entity51 camera , 2 gigabtyes of @entity53 and an estimated 10 hours of battery life			2
so the new device , which goes on sale february 5 , is all about giving users more storage space			0
that 's why @entity7 is targeting the @entity8 at professional users such as architects , doctors or audio engineers , who often work with large files ( and can afford pricey gadgets )			2
" companies regularly utilizing large amounts of data such as @entity72 files , x-rays , film edits , music tracks , project blueprints , training videos and service manuals all benefit from having a greater choice of storage options for @entity8 , " @entity7 said in a news release announcing the new @entity8			1
some observers say the tablet 's cost -- $ 799 ( @entity85 only ) and $ 929 ( @entity85 and cellular ) , $ 100 more than the current @entity36 model -- is n't worth it in an age when we can store movies , music , photos and documents on cloud - based servers instead of our own machines			1
" @entity7 does n't expect you to buy a @entity8 , not unless you 're a professional - grade buyer , like an architect or a supervillain , " writes @entity96 for @entity97			1
" the @entity8 is like a $ 300/head steakhouse dinner			1
it goes on the corporate account			2
" other pundits noted that at $ 929 , the top - of - the - line @entity105 model costs almost as much as the base - model @entity107 laptop ( $ 999 ) , which is much easier to type on			0
" @entity7 has set its eyes on the dying infrastructure of the @entity114 industry and @entity117 's @entity116 operating system business , " writes @entity109 of @entity110			0
" that is really the only reason that @entity120 would unveil an @entity8 with 128 gb , a size that challenges many of the ' ultrabooks ' that have become popular in the laptop market these days			1
" in that way , the launch of the new @entity8 seems poised to stave off competition from @entity117 's @entity128 tablet , due february 9 in the @entity129 and @entity130			0
when it comes to storage capacity , though , these tablets are n't close to being the biggest			1
that distinction belongs to the @entity135 , which retails for $ 3,579 and has a whopping @entity136 of internal storage .			2

@entity7 introduces @entity8 with 128 gb of storage capacity . twice as much as previous models
the average user wo n't need that much internal storage
128 gigabytes is equivalent of about 100 dvd - quality movies , 30,000 songs or 40,000 photos
@entity97 : " 128 gb @entity8 is like a $ 300/head steakhouse dinner . it goes on the corporate account "
