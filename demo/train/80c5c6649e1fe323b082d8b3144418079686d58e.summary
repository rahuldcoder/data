these were the foods @entity5 grew up on in rural @entity6			1
" one of the earliest food memories i have is my grandfather making hamburgers ... my grandmother frying potatoes , " he says			2
" of course , in those days , everything was fried in lard			0
" @entity5 still enjoys those foods , despite having lost -- and kept off -- more than 100 pounds			1
he does n't make substitutions or skip the bun			0
his weight loss secret is n't really a secret at all			2
@entity5 , the executive chef at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity6 , started gaining weight after high school while working in restaurants , first as a waiter , then as a cook			1
at the time , he was studying law enforcement in college , but in between classes , he came home to watch the @entity32			0
" i just got consumed , " he says			0
he did n't really notice that he had gained 20 or 30 pounds over his freshman year			2
he ignored the signs when his clothes stopped fitting			0
later , when an overweight friend at work mentioned their similarities , he was confused			0
" i never saw it , " @entity5 says			1
" it 's a weird realization when you 're gaining weight			1
you think , you 're getting older			0
" then in late 2004 , @entity5 stepped on a scale for the first time in years			1
the scale , which only went up to 300 pounds , refused to register his weight			1
when he finally found another scale to tell him the truth , it was worse			0
the 6 - foot - 2 - inch chef was 327 pounds			1
" to realize that you 're not just obese , but morbidly obese , it was pretty tough on the mental psyche			0
" @entity5 started looking at his daily habits a little closer			1
he switched from regular @entity58 to @entity59 and lost 10 pounds over a couple months			1
then he picked up a book -- " @entity61 " by @entity62 -- that he saw @entity63 discussing on her show			2
as a chef , he 'd always had a love for @entity67			2
if anything could motivate him , this was it			0
the book talked about eating smaller portions , drinking water and walking everywhere			2
so @entity5 started doing the same			1
he tried to drink eight glasses of water every day , and he made an effort to walk for at least an hour before or after work			2
take upwave 's challenge : drink more water ! the book 's tips helped him drop another 20 pounds			1
but it was n't enough			0
after reading about a @entity85 chef who had lost weight , @entity5 decided to conduct an experiment			1
for one day , he wrote everything that he tasted at his restaurant down on disposable spoons and tossed the spoons into a pan			2
at the end of the day , he tallied the calories			1
he had consumed more than 4,000 just from tasting his dishes			1
" breakfast , lunch , dinner in addition to that -- i was taking in 6,000 calories a day , " @entity5 says			1
" and not being an @entity104 athlete , it was kind of hard to burn it off			0
" @entity5 could n't stop tasting his food			1
so he started discreetly spitting out his tastes into the trash			2
from that point on , nothing could stop him			0
when he hit 250 pounds , he started jogging			1
when he lost 10 more pounds , he ran a @entity112 race			1
when he got down to 230 pounds , he proposed			0
then he and his fiancee started taking a friend 's @entity115 class			1
" man , the weight really started falling off then , " he says			1
" i 'm a 36 - year - old white guy with no rhythm			0
it 's a fun exercise when you get over the fact that you feel stupid doing it			0
" by the time the couple married in july 2011 , @entity5 weighed 190 pounds			1
" i think the only way to really consistently lose weight and keep it off is to develop moderation and portion control , " he says			0
" you need to eat what you want to eat , just try to maintain control			0
" with three kids and a growing catering company , the days of a 40 - hour work week are long gone			0
still , @entity5 makes time to run at least four days a week as he trains for the @entity134 on april 19			2
some days , dinner is a @entity138 's double cheeseburger and kid - sized fries			0
he refuses to give up margarine , despite the @entity142 's warnings about the health risks of partially hydrogenated oils			0
but overall , @entity5 has adopted the healthy lessons he learned in " @entity61			2
" more importantly he 's adopted the author 's attitude : " the key ? not guilt or deprivation but learning to get the most from the things you most enjoy			0
