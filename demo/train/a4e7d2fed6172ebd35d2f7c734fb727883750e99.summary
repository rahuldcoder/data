@entity0 , @entity1 -- after three weeks , the closely watched @entity5 versus @entity4 patent trial wound down tuesday with four hours of closing arguments			1
@entity5 is accusing @entity4 of copying the design of the @entity8 and @entity9 , suing @entity4 for $ 2.5 billion			1
@entity4 denies any wrongdoing and is counter suing @entity5 for $ 519 million , also for patent infringement			1
tuesday 's closing arguments capped off weeks of testimony that included highs -- colorful stories from @entity5 executives about the @entity8 's origin -- and lows -- jurors nodding off during drier discussions of software patents			1
the final battle for the jury 's favor had a little bit of both			0
judge @entity27 urged the two sides to try one last time to reach a settlement friday			0
@entity5 chief executive @entity30 spoke monday to former @entity4 ceo @entity31 but they could n't reach an agreement			1
now the decision rests with the jury , which must determine exactly what devices violated which patents , as well as how much money , if any , is owed in damages			0
while its decision could go either way , what 's certain is that the outcome will have a far - reaching impact on the technology industry			1
closing arguments throughout the trial , the two sides presented their cases with distinctly different styles , which were represented in the closing statements			1
@entity5 generally went more for emotional impact by keeping its narrative simple and engaging , showing the jury easy - to - understand images of devices			2
@entity4 argued that @entity5 's approach did n't go deep enough to prove that individual devices infringed on patents , and dove into more technical detail			1
@entity5 urged jurors to judge based on " historical documents " and to look at the evidence in chronological order			2
" that 's where you 'll find the truth , " said @entity5 counsel @entity66			2
@entity4 put the emphasis on chunks of transcribed text of testimony from the trial that it said supported its case			2
both sides injected a mix of anger , passion and hyperbole into their closing arguments			1
" @entity5 took five years to bring this revolution to @entity85 ; @entity4 took three months to copy it			1
that 's the truth and that 's simple , clear , and not disputed			0
" said @entity66 , referring to the the three months @entity4 spent developing the @entity89 smartphone			2
@entity4 did n't spend much time denying the similarities between the product lines , but rather claiming that form followed function			2
" it 's not against the law to be inspired by your competition , " said @entity4 counsel @entity95 , going on to argue that @entity5 ca n't patent " a rectangle with rounded corners			1
" he compared current smartphone design to tvs , which changed across brands from thick heavy boxes to black , flat rectangles			0
@entity4 claimed that @entity5 was being anti-competitive , and " seeking a competitive edge through the courtroom			1
" any decision in @entity5 's favor , @entity4 warned , would lead to a country made up of " giant conglomerates , armed with patent arsenals , that block competition			1
" @entity5 also painted its side as best for @entity85 , saying a decision for @entity5 would be reaffirming the @entity85 patent system , allowing companies to continue hiring people and investing in technology companies			2
just finding for @entity5 would n't be enough , it claimed , as a slap on the wrist would n't stop @entity4 from doing the same thing again			1
a main point of contention throughout the trial was customer confusion -- if a casual shopper could confuse a similar - looking @entity4 product for an @entity8 or @entity9			1
@entity5 insisted that the jury did not need to believe people had actually been fooled into buying the wrong product , just that the overall visual resemblance between @entity4 and @entity5 products is deceptive			1
@entity4 said no analysis was presented on whether or not any customers were confused at the point of sale , and contended that there was no deception or confusion			2
" customers make choices , not mistakes , " said @entity95			0
what 's ahead for the jury the jury has to reach a unanimous verdict , a task complicated by the amount of variables in the decision			0
jurors must fill out a daunting 20 - page verdict form , marking on worksheets exactly which @entity4 products infringe on @entity5 patents and vice versa			1
judge @entity159 has expressed concern in recent days that members of the jury could be " seriously confused			0
" there are 84 jury instructions totaling 102 pages , including recaps of accusations , key terminology , and directions on how to operate the smartphones and tablets			0
" i need everyone to stay conscious during the reading of instructions , including myself " said @entity159 , who read the entire document to the jury on tuesday morning , being sure to throw in periodic standing breaks to keep the jury alert			0
the thick document will serve as a guide for jurors when they begin deliberations at 9 a.m. wednesday			0
they 'll also have access to the full line of contested smartphones and tablets so they can examine the hardware and software up close			0
larger implications @entity5 is asking for $ 2.5 billion in damages			2
the amount , if awarded in full , would be almost three times the amount of the largest patent verdict ever , according to @entity195 , a law professor at @entity196			0
but the amount is n't what would have the biggest impact on the smartphone industry			0
" even more important than the money is the risk of an injunction , " said @entity195			0
@entity4 could be forced to pull its products from the market and redesign them , a costly and time - consuming process that would give @entity5 an advantage in the smartphone and tablet market , especially if consumers prefer to stick with @entity5 's familiar designs			1
the ramifications would n't stop with @entity4			2
a verdict for @entity5 would serve as a warning to all @entity216 handset manufacturers			1
" @entity5 's real target in this suit is the @entity216 ecosystem , not just @entity4 , " said @entity195			1
there 's some debate over whether forcing these companies back to the drawing board would have long term benefits			0
@entity195 says it could promote more diversity , but not necessarily innovation			0
a new report from investment research firm @entity228 says that in the long run , forcing competitors to experiment with new designs could result in new products that are an even greater risk to @entity5			2
" it could hurt @entity5 because the real threat is not a competitor beating @entity5 at its own game but instead changing the game , " the report says			0
if @entity4 wins , it 's possible @entity216 smartphone and tablet makers would continue to make products similar to @entity5 's , leading to more unified design across the industry and a dearth of innovative new products			1
a split decision is also a possibility			0
@entity248 , a law professor at @entity249 , says a decision that finds both companies liable for patent infringement would confirm the importance of smartphone and tablet patents			0
" it may also accelerate the trend of companies amassing enormous patent portfolios to protect their freedom to operate and provide ' insurance " if they are sued for patent infringement , ' said @entity248			0
one thing everyone can agree on is that a jury decision is n't likely to end the @entity5 versus @entity4 drama			1
" one can expect appeals and perhaps , ultimately , a settlement			0

the @entity5 versus @entity4 patent trial had its closing arguments tuesday
jurors will now decide if any @entity4 products copied the @entity9 and @entity8
a finding for @entity5 could have far - reaching implications for @entity216 device makers
