@entity3 's @entity10 district is the city 's center of nightlife , enchanting visitors and locals with its unique combination of seedy bars , upscale nightclubs , historic churches and 19th - century mansions			1
a century ago , @entity10 was the home of @entity3 's @entity73 bourgeoisie -- religious and ethnic minorities including @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
the collapse of the @entity21 during @entity79 led to " population exchanges " that prompted the departure of many @entity77			0
decades later , @entity29 authorities imposed crippling minority taxes which accelerated the emigration of the city 's indigenous @entity77 community in the 1950s and ' 60s			1

while many mourn the appearance of @entity143 franchises along @entity120 , others welcome the change , not least president @entity137 , whose ruling @entity138 has pushed to overhaul @entity3 and drive @entity29 's economic growth			1
under @entity137 , the city has been awash with massive construction and urban development projects ranging from gentrifying dilapidated neighborhoods near @entity10 to building a new bridge and metro tunnel across the @entity152			1
under this tide of change , 19th - and 20th - century shopping arcades , once cluttered with mom and pop shops and tea houses , have today been replaced by modern shopping malls and luxury hotels			0
@entity2 owner @entity30 plans to reopen his bar in a new location , but he 's unlikely to find a location as historic and quixotic as the old @entity19 , and concedes this might be a problem			0
