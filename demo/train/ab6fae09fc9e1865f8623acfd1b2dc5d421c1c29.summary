-- @entity1 has what you could call food form			1
three restaurants in the town of 200,000 on @entity9 's northeastern @entity8 coast hold the gastronomic holy grail of three @entity12 stars -- only @entity13 has more @entity12 - starred eateries per square meter			1
it 's already pretty obvious why global gourmets frequently place it atop their must - eat list			1
and then you add the pintxos			0
@entity21 , or spikes in the @entity24 language that 's proudly heard throughout the region , are tapas taken to a whole new level			2
no sweaty chorizo or clammy calamari on cocktail sticks here			0
@entity1 's pintxos bars are culinary tours de force in their own right , delivering dishes that would n't look out of place in their @entity12 - starred neighbors			1
the only challenge facing visitors to this gastronomic wonderland is not what , but where , to eat			0
i took the route of long , slow restaurant lunches , followed by late night hopping between the pintxos bars			2
foie gras ice cream my food quest kicked off with lunch at the venerable institution , @entity53			1
it 's here that 71 - year - old @entity55 - @entity53 has held a @entity12 star for 40 years and three stars for a quarter of a century			1
twenty - five years at the absolute pinnacle of any profession is remarkable , but in the uber - competitive world of fine dining , it 's unprecedented			1
arzak the restaurant is the story of the @entity53 family			1
@entity67 's grandparents built the property as a wine cellar and tavern in 1897 , while he started working there in 1966			2
the unassuming exterior on a suburban street leads into a modernist dining room where the same menu is served at lunch and in the evening			0
calling it a meal , however , does n't really do it justice			0
it 's a culinary joyride of beauty , complexity and even wit			2
foie gras is served as an ice cream , featuring caramelized onions and green tea , in an inverted yucca cone dusted with shellfish powder			0
fine dining laboratory a deceptively simple but sublime dish features cubes of potato , egg yolk and white truffle			0
for an overload of smells , tastes , sights and sounds , grilled lobster with charcoal - roasted zucchini is served on a translucent plate above an @entity105 playing a video of waves crashing in to shore			2
@entity53 's post-dessert petits fours feature a candy shop and workshop mash - up called @entity112 , or @entity113 , with silver sugar keys , cola bottle tops , chocolate nuts and screws			1
as would be expected from one of the world 's top restaurants , the wine cellar features terrifyingly rare and expensive vintages			2
a back - of - house look reveals a laboratory where new dishes are created and a room featuring 1,500 different spices			0
@entity129 's most popular tortillas ? the @entity53 family have defined and owned @entity12 - starred cuisine in @entity1 and cemented the town 's reputation			1
today that reputation is as much focused on pintxos bars as @entity12 stars and , having gradually recovered from an epic lunch , it 's time to consider evening options			1
while it 's possible to be led by your eyes into one of scores of pintxos bars , a small group tour is an excellent introduction and allows you to get to know some of the very best dishes and venues			2
@entity150 @entity149 ditched a career in finance to follow his passion , setting up @entity154 to offer tours of the bars , local producers and vineyards that give the @entity24 region such an enviable reputation			0
he explains that the pintxos bars " are the cool , young siblings to the @entity12 stars and offer ultimate flexibility ; informal dining , bite - sized portions , low prices and the chance to switch at the turn of a heel from traditional to modern cuisine			1
" an evening tour led by a donostiarra ( a @entity1 local ) takes visitors from one to the next for small bites and pours of local ciders and wines , especially txakoli , a slightly sparkling young white wine			1
countless bars , some traditional , others more cutting edge in cuisine and atmosphere , try to outdo one another with heaving displays or specialties			0
@entity186 serves a famous tortilla , but only in limited numbers , at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. precisely			1
turn up 15 minutes late and prepare to leave disappointed			1
legendary anchovies the rare delicacy of percebes or goose barnacles at @entity193 are less punctual , but worth spending time on			0
the boquerones ( fresh anchovies ) at @entity197 are legendary			0
@entity149 nails pintxos culture when he says it 's all about the social context			0
" lining the streets of the old town , everyone is there to have fun , between the barmen , the locals and visitors , creating a lively camaraderie filled with wine , food and chattering			0
" as if the culinary gods had n't blessed @entity1 enough with @entity12 stars and pintxos bars , there are also scores of artisanal producers dotted throughout the historic town			1
the central food market is a treasure trove of local produce , in particular the rightly famous @entity222 ( ham from acorn - fed pigs )			0
in those brief pauses between eating some of the world 's greatest food , it 's worth taking a walk on the beautiful beaches or promenade , drinking in the sea air and stunning vistas and dreaming of being a donostiarra			0
