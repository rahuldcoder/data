one of two planes carrying a 30 - person assessment team arrived at @entity15 airport about 5:30 p.m. wednesday			2
the team will assess what @entity5 needs to cope with the immediate aftermath of the disaster			1
one of the team 's first jobs is to get the airport working to a point where it can handle all the flights coming in from around the world filled with people and supplies to help the victims of the quake			2
the @entity30 is leading the @entity32 's response			0
gen. @entity33 , deputy commander of the @entity30 , was in @entity5 when the quake struck and has seen the situation at the airport			1
" he says the runway is functional , but the tower does n't have communications capability			0
the passenger terminal ... has structural damage to it , so we do n't know what the status of it is , " said gen. @entity39 , head of @entity30			0
" so we have a group going in to make sure we can gain and secure the airfield and operate from it , because that 's one of those locations we think we 're going to have a lot of the immediate effort -- from an international basis -- going into			0
" the group includes a unit of @entity2 @entity58 @entity57 that departed @entity59 in @entity60 on wednesday afternoon			0
they include airmen and equipment to set up temporary air traffic control systems as well as search - and - rescue experts			1
@entity39 also has ordered the aircraft carrier @entity67 to steam toward @entity5			1
the ship was at sea near @entity70 when the quake hit and as it sails south , it will stop at @entity72 , @entity60 , @entity73 to pick up supplies			0
the @entity67 " had a very small complement of aircraft on it when it was at sea , " @entity39 told reporters at the @entity32 on wednesday			2
" as ... it passes through or by @entity72 , we 're going to provision it with as much capability as we can , primarily looking at helicopter capacity ... because we need to be able to get around the country			0
" the carrier is able to provide needed helicopters for lifting aid from the ship into the country as well as moving construction equipment to places where the machines are needed to clear rubble			2
the @entity93 also activated the hospital ship @entity95 , based in @entity96 , @entity97 , on wednesday			0
while the @entity30 has not officially asked for the ship , the @entity93 activated it proactively expecting it will be requested			0

it could be ready at the latest by monday			0
the ship is staffed by 64 crew and 560 hospital personnel , and when ready it will sail toward @entity5 in case it is requested			1
@entity30 has ordered a unit of about 2,000 @entity106 to head to @entity5			1
the @entity106 will deploy aboard a large deck amphibious ship , which would give the military more helicopters to work with in @entity5			1
it also has a large medical facility that could help with treating the injured			2
