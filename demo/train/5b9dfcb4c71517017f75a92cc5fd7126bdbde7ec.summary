-- after weeks of vague pronouncements on world events , president @entity1 finally spoke forcefully wednesday			1
he delivered a strong statement about the horrendous beheadings of journalists @entity6 and @entity8 and spoke about what the @entity9 planned to do with @entity11 , the terror group which calls itself the @entity12			1
" it 's not only that we 're going to be bringing to justice those who perpetrated this terrible crime against these two fine young men , but more broadly the @entity9 will continue to lead a regional and international effort against the barbaric and ultimately empty vision that ( @entity11 ) represents , " he said			1
" and that 's going to take some time , but we 're going to get it done			1
" in a speech later in the day , the president warned that @entity25 would respond to @entity27 aggression			1
the president needs to to be doing more of this kind of explaining , for both foreign and domestic policy			1
for too much of the time in recent weeks , he has been too focused on criticizing those who have questioned his policies			1
@entity1 has attacked republicans for being obstructionists			1
he has taken on the news media for focusing on negative stories and repeating stories that are based on speculation , falsehood , and innuendo			2
he has even been attacking some @entity41 for not being enthusiastic enough about what he has done			0
not everything that he says is unfair or inaccurate			0
indeed , congressional republicans have been extremely obstructionist , making it impossible to accomplish virtually anything on @entity47			0
" stop just hating all the time , " he mockingly said during a speech in @entity49 about domestic policy			2
the media have their virtues and they have their flaws , but reporters often do inflate crisis stories in an attempt to win over viewers and readers			2
often small stories are exaggerated and false stories gain a full hearing on the airwaves			0
regardless , these kinds of complaints only go so far			0
the truth is that every president faces immense challenges : every president faces unfair media , and congressional opponents are usually tough			1
none of this is really new			0
to be effective , great presidents still work over these problems to shape public debate and to provide guidance to voters on major issues of the day			2
at their best , they can be the explainers in chief			0
in doing so , presidents do not have to be dogmatic , idealistic or simplistic			2
they can help @entity9 understand the story even if they do n't have all the answers			1
this is a vital function that we expect of our leaders			0
great presidents have done this in the past			2
during the @entity97 , as @entity92 and @entity93 engaged in a brutal conflict over the institution of slavery , president @entity90 -- in a very different media age -- offered a series of cogent speeches that reminded @entity100 of what they were fighting for while pointing to the need to restore the @entity103 to its whole			1
" it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain , that this nation under @entity116 shall have a new birth of freedom , and that government of the people , by the people , for the people shall not perish from the earth , " @entity90 said			0
as the nation descended into a horrible depression in the 1930s , president @entity124 made bold speeches and took to the airwaves through fireside chats on the radio to restore a sense of confidence about how the nation would rebound from hard times			2
" the only thing we have to fear is fear itself , " he said in one of the most memorable lines in @entity9 political history			1
his vision of the @entity140 offered a powerful road map for how the federal government could flex its regulatory muscle to revitalize the foundation of the economy			0
president @entity146 used his flurry of domestic legislation in 1964 and 1965 -- which he called the @entity150 -- to help @entity9 see how they could collectively work their way out of the social conflict and despair that afflicted huge pockets of the nation even in the best of economic times			1
@entity146 , during the part of his presidency where he was popular , relied on legislation to show how the nation could help ameliorate the racial and economic disparities that were causing immense tensions throughout the nation			0
as @entity92 engaged in brutal conflicts over civil rights for african - americans , @entity146 offered a powerful response , including a famous speech about voting rights in 1965 that highlighted how the government would step in to protect the rights of all @entity9			1
" many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult , " he told @entity173 in the wake of the march on @entity176 , @entity177			0
" but about this there can and should be no argument			0
every @entity9 citizen must have an equal right to vote			1
there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right			0
there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right			0
" president @entity192 helped inspire his supporters to feel that the economic stagflation of the 1970s would not be permanent			2
as he took office in 1981 , many @entity9 felt little hope that there would ever be another period of vibrant economic growth or that the @entity9 would ever regain its standing overseas			1
through his fierce championing of tax cuts , deregulation and anti-communism , the president helped large portions of the public see how the future might be better			2
supporters love the ideas of great presidents , opponents hate them			0
but most importantly , the effective leaders put a set of ideas on the table to help make sense of the inevitable and chronic chaos of world affairs			0
@entity1 needs to do more of what we heard wednesday			1
with the emergence of @entity11 in the @entity223 , @entity27 aggression in @entity225 , and major domestic challenges such as poverty , inequality and race , @entity1 must step in			1
he should use the final years of his presidency to help create a foundation for the public to face these challenges and start thinking about a viable and rational path forward in coming years			0
the costs of remaining silent , of being too cool , are too high .			0

president @entity1 speaks out forcefully on @entity225 , @entity11 on wednesday
@entity238 : it 's about time the president focused on explaining , not *blaming*
