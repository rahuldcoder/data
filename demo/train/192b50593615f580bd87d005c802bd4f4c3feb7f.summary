@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced friday that states will be allowed to opt out of certain requirements imposed by the controversial @entity5 law , the landmark education reform initiative passed with broad bipartisan support a decade ago			1
the administration will immediately begin reviewing state applications to waive various demands imposed by the law in return for credible commitments to close lingering achievement gaps			1
" higher standards are the right goal			0
accountability is the right goal			0
closing the achievement gap is the right goal , " @entity2 said at the @entity19			1
" but experience has taught us that in its implementation , @entity5 has some serious flaws			1
" among other things , the law , which passed 2001 , requires public schools to meet targets aimed at making all students proficient in reading and math by 2014 or face stiff penalties			2
the @entity33 has predicted that , without waivers , up to 82 % of the nation 's schools could miss that target and end up facing penalties including the loss of federal education dollars			2
@entity2 blasted @entity42 for failing to change the law , a failure that forced the administration to act on its own , the president said			1
" we ca n't afford to wait for an education system that is n't doing everything it should for our kids , " @entity2 said			2
" we 've got to act now and harness all the good ideas coming out of our states ( and ) coming out of our schools			2
" a senior administration official speaking to reporters on a conference call thursday said the law " is hurting children by denying the children most at risk the resources they really need			2
" under @entity2 's reforms , states will be encouraged to enact accountability standards that do n't treat all schools the same			1
specifically , schools will have to implement new teacher and principal accountability standards			0
local districts will have to set basic guidelines to evaluate a teacher 's performance based on a number of factors , not simply student performance			0
" the purpose is not to give states and districts a reprieve from accountability , but rather to unleash energy to improve our schools at the local level , " @entity2 said in a separate statement released by the @entity19			1
one of the major criticisms of the current @entity5 guidelines is that it encouraged schools to lower standards rather than improve			2
the new guidelines " should reduce the pressure to teach the test and the narrowing of the curriculum , " one administration official said			0
six months ago , the administration sent @entity42 its plan to revamp @entity5			1
that legislation , however , has stalled			0
the administration insists it has n't enacted the new changes alone			0
instead , it has reached out and received input from 45 states that helped develop the new guidelines for opting out of @entity5 standards			1
in addition , senior administration officials told reporters that 44 states and the @entity0 are working to adopt a common set of state - developed college and career - ready standards			0
some critics fear the new guidelines will ultimately give the federal government an even larger role in states ' education decisions			0
administration officials deny the accusation , instead maintaining that the new guidelines will actually give states more flexibility , including how to spend 20 % of their @entity123 money , which funds low - income education and can account for as much as a billion dollars nationwide			0
currently , @entity5 requires states spend that portion of federal education dollars on tutoring			1
the administration says many states and school districts are already moving toward the new guidelines			0
states can file a request for a waiver from the requirements by mid-november and the waivers could be granted in early 2012			1
@entity1 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report			0
