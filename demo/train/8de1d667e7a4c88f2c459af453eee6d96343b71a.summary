-- just when you thought it was impossible for @entity5 to become any more contemptible , the group in a recent publication boasted of its success in bringing the return of slavery			1
more specifically , it announced and provided elaborate justification for the enslavement of women			1
we did n't need a new propaganda effort from the self - appointed @entity15 to know the nightmare that has befallen women in territories captured by its fighters			1
now we 've had a look at the twisted logic that rationalizes sexual exploitation , killing and enslavement of women and young girls			2
is it any wonder then that women in @entity31 and @entity32 have moved to the forefront of the war against @entity5 ? they have taken up arms , organized civil protests and warned the world about the threat that @entity5 poses			1
a woman is leading @entity41 forces fighting @entity5 in the city of @entity43 , @entity32			1
and a substantial number -- more than one third -- of the @entity41 battlefield troops in @entity32 are women			1
one reason they fight is that women have more to lose than anyone else			2
for a time , the rumors seemed so extreme , so outlandish , that they were met with a dose of skepticism : talk of slave markets , mass kidnappings , women treated as spoils of war distributed among the victorious fighters , sounded like tales from a historic account , not of a 21st - century conflict			2
but in 2014 , using the @entity65 , @entity5 described what it did with members of @entity31 's @entity69 minority : " after capture , the @entity69 women and children were then divided according to @entity73 amongst the fighters of the @entity15			1
... " the explanation included " scholarly analysis " to justify the religious logic and social benefits of reviving the slavery of women			0
" one should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the @entity73 , or @entity88 law			0
" it seems pointless to discuss religious doctrine with a group determined to kill its way into the imposition of seventh - century norms more than 1,400 years after they were written			0
a number of top @entity88 clerics have rejected @entity5 ' interpretation of islamic law			0
and some @entity100 argue the @entity101 is actually egalitarian			0
@entity5 , in contrast , finds slavery and the holding of concubines a beneficial practice , writing that " a number of contemporary scholars " say the end of slavery has led to an increase in " adultery , fornication , etc. " the latest publication confirms what human rights investigators and survivors of @entity5 have reported			1
the @entity118 says slave markets now operate in @entity120 , the @entity5 " capital " in @entity32 , and in @entity121 , until recently a modern city in @entity31			1
@entity118 investigators interviewed witnesses , who told of women taken captive by @entity5 , sexually abused and handed to slave traders			1
the @entity118 estimates there are at least 2,500 victims			0
others say the number may be much higher			0
when @entity41 forces recaptured @entity132 , they reportedly said they found a woman naked and tied up , who had been raped repeatedly by @entity5 men			0
similar reports have come from other @entity5 - controlled areas			2
just like the publicized beheading of captives has a strategic purpose , the treatment of women as battlefield loot is a way of enticing new recruits			1
but it is also a powerful motivation for women to join the fight			0
in the battle over @entity43 , just across the border from @entity152 , ground troops are led by two top officers of the @entity154 , the @entity155			0
one of them is a woman , @entity157 , known in the battlefield as @entity159			0
about 35 % of @entity154 's forces are women			0
then there is @entity163 , the @entity164 , counting 7,500 uniformed fighters , some barely bigger than their rifles			0
@entity41 women from @entity152 have volunteered to fight alongside their @entity41 brethren in @entity32			1
inside @entity121 , women organized resistance against @entity5 ' oppressive rule			2
the women 's rights activist @entity173 denounced @entity5 atrocities on social media			2
she was arrested , tortured and executed by an @entity5 firing squad women physicians in @entity121 organized a strike when @entity5 ordered them to cover their faces			2
at least one of the strikers was executed , as have been countless female lawyers , doctors and other professional women			0
a turning point in global attention to the threat posed by @entity5 came in august , when a woman , a @entity69 legislator , took the floor in the @entity31 parliament , saying @entity5 was committing genocide against @entity31 's @entity69			1
" mr. speaker , " cried out @entity192 , the only @entity69 member of parliament , " we are being slaughtered			0
" since then , while the @entity195 helped save thousands of @entity69 and started bombing @entity5 without putting " boots on the ground , " countless women , mostly @entity41 , have laced up their boots and headed to the battlefield			2
the worst of @entity5 treatment is reserved for " infidels , " or for those defying their orders			1
in areas under @entity5 control , women are required to observe strict clothing rules and are not allowed to leave the house without a male relative			1
violators can be whipped or even executed			0
it 's worth remembering that many of the women facing these restrictions had been living modern lives			0
just when it seemed @entity5 could not be more offensive and threatening , it has provided everyone , especially , women even more reasons to fight back .			1

@entity5 publication justifies reasons for enslavement of women in captured areas
@entity231 : is it any wonder that women in @entity31 and @entity32 are now active in fighting @entity5 ?
she says @entity5 ' treatment of women as loot for fighters could be used to entice recruits
@entity243 : @entity5 has provided everyone , especially women , even more reasons to fight back
