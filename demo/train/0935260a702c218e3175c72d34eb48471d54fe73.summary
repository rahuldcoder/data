-- a really bad gift can be a sign that your relationship is headed over a cliff , columnist says			1
have you seen that @entity7 commercial where the guy gives his date a beautiful necklace , only to have the woman look kind of uncomfortable and announce that she did n't think they were quite " there " yet ? after a flash of hurt crosses his face , he zings back that he bought it at @entity7 so it was super cheap			2
i always high - five that guy in my head , but truth is , i 've been an ungrateful giftee in the past			1
however , it 's also the truth that i 've received a lot of crappy gifts			1
some were heartfelt , others were just dumb			0
so in light of the fact that we 're in primo gift - exchange season , i put together some guidelines for how to handle the gifts you get that you really wish you had n't ... too utilitarian i thought only married ladies woke up to things like vacuum cleaners or shower squeegees under their tree			1
a yoga instructor i know received a dustbuster from her live - in boyfriend , while singer / songwriter @entity46 had a beau who gifted her with an oven mitt			1
" i should 've yelled , " she recalls			0
" i think i just had a stunned , very disappointed look on my face			0
not sure what he was trying to say , but clearly we were nearing an end			1
" how to handle : generally , i 'm of the mind that you should try to smile and eke out a thank you , no matter what			0
but when someone -- particularly a live - in partner -- gives you something designed to make cooking for or cleaning up after them a little easier			1
well , no. just no. the @entity0 : when a bad gift reveals an even worse relationship wrong size you have to have a little sympathy for the dude brave ( or foolhardy ) enough to buy you clothes			1
even if he has your style down , most men are clueless with women 's sizes			1
searching your closet is n't much help either as one designer 's " m " is another 's " @entity78 , " so he 's screwed either way			2
if he buys something too small , then you have a gift that does n't fit and makes you feel fat			2
if he buys something too large , you 'll be convinced he thinks you 're a chubster			0
how to handle : do n't take it personally			0
politely tell him that while you love the dress / sweater / chaps , it 's not your size and you 're going to exchange it for something that 'll allow you to exhale			2
the @entity0 : my boyfriend does n't like my hairy legs ! utterly clueless " our first @entity99 together , my ex bought me all action figures , from sports and horror movies , " shares my friend , @entity97			2
" one was a bobblehead ! " @entity97 's now - ex had never been in a serious relationship before , so he was n't being cruel with the bobblehead , just clueless			1
how to handle : @entity97 knew better the next year			2
" develop specific lists of things you want on @entity111 , @entity112 , wherever , " she advises			1
" and let him choose from a list of things you already know you like			0
because sorry -- if you want to be surprised , you most surely will be			0
" and not in a good way			0
the @entity0 : the 5 lies women tell themselves i 'm not her i still remember the unspeakably ugly , donut - shaped , skull - adorned , pleather purse my man bought me one year			1
but perfect for his ex -- a much younger goth chick			0
with a forced smile i told him it seemed that he was shopping for the ghost of relationships past			0
how to handle : calmly explain that while she was @entity134 , you are @entity135 's and he has to shop accordingly			2
men tend to think women all want the same things , so if he spent years getting used to gifting a one way , there might be a period of adjustment while he resets			0
the message you can learn a lot about a relationship from the gifts you exchange			1
" the last @entity99 we were together i gave him a suitcase , and he gave me a set of knives , " says an editor i interviewed			0
the two split up by mid-january			0
my message gift was a cheapo , faux turquoise , @entity160 - style , silver - plated bracelet that an ex picked out with help from the girl he was cheating on me with			1
how to handle : you got the gift , do n't wait for the engraved announcement -- get out			2
the @entity0 : 9 inexcusable excuses for breaking up			0

@entity170 is the time of the year when some really bad gifts can be delivered
it 's always bad for live - in partner to gift something to make it easier to clean up after them
boyfriends can be clueless , so develop lists of *favorites* on @entity111 or @entity112
totally *thoughtless* gifts may be sign that your relationship is about to end
