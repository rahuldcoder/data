-- packaging can change how people see things			2
and when it comes to sex , it could maybe help save lives too			2
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , a @entity9 - based international ngo , has teamed up with @entity11 artist @entity10 to create an eye - catching condom line with pop art - inspired packaging to promote safe sex and raise awareness about hiv / aids			1
the group has turned to crowdsourcing website @entity20 to raise funds for its campaign , which aims to encourage condom usage among local youth in a country where an estimated 1.6 million people struggle with hiv / aids			1
" they were giving out free condoms when i went to the @entity28 conference in @entity33 recently , " says @entity8 director of operations @entity29			1
" these condoms were brightly colored , like nothing seen in @entity11 -- glow in the dark , different flavors , different prints			1
we put a picture of them on @entity43 and we had youth calling us up asking where they could purchase them , " he adds			2
" we 've never had that sort of reaction to @entity8 programs			1
so we said why do n't we try produce our own condom line because there seems to be a market			0
we want to innovate and create new programming that is sustainable and even generates income for the youth , " he adds			0
. stigma vs. safety @entity28 / @entity60 continues to be one of the most prominent public health obstacles many @entity64 countries face today			0
in recent years , the disease -- which had reached epidemic proportions -- has started to decline in @entity11 as a result of stronger public awareness campaigns and the impact of local education programs			1
while the outlook is positive , campaigners say more needs to be done to continue to reduce the threat of hiv / aids in the country -- a start could be made by tackling the stigma surrounding the purchase of condoms			2
" most people are actually very afraid of going to vendors in supermarkets and chemists to buy condoms because we are a fairly reserved society , " explains @entity81 , communications and marketing officer at @entity8			1
" most people are n't very open to the idea that very young people might walk into a shop just to buy condoms because nobody wants to be known to be having sex ... there is so much stigma associated with condom purchase in the country			2
" eye - catching designs to address this , the bright packaging of @entity8 ' colored condoms is specifically designed to disguise the product inside			1
@entity81 explains that by making condoms less obvious , more people will be willing to buy them			0
she also says that the condoms currently available in the country are either too expensive or low quality -- issues , she claims , will be tackled with the @entity8 condom line			1
" for the condoms that are given out for free at schools , the youth still do not take them , " argues @entity81			2
" they look at them and think : ' you know what , you are giving this for free but they are not good quality			0
' so they 'd probably just have unprotected sex rather than use the ones that are easily accessible			0
" collaborating with artists but getting an artist to agree to provide designs for the packaging became a struggle			0
many did n't want their work associated with sex and @entity8 hit a roadblock -- until they met with @entity10			1
the @entity9 - based artist is well - known for his bold , but often controversial , themes placed within his paintings			2
unafraid to shy away from taboo subjects like sex and interracial relationships , @entity10 was more than happy to collaborate with the @entity142			1
" i felt like everybody is basically trying to deal with this whole issue -- @entity28 , unwanted pregnancies -- and when i talk about everybody i mean the church is doing whatever they can , the government is doing whatever they can , " says @entity10			0
" i felt the project was a good thing			0
i wanted to try to chip in and create something that would help fight a good fight , " he says			0
@entity10 explains that sex is n't discussed openly and that as a result many young people learn about the dangers of unprotected sex the hard way -- through experience			0
however , he does believe awareness is increasing and he hopes his work will continue to change attitudes surrounding sex in @entity11			1
" i think it 's important to try and play a part and make sure that people will not go through the same mistakes as what my generation has gone through			0
