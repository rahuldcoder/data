-- for 50 years the environmental movement has unsuccessfully argued that we should save the planet for moral reasons , that there were more important things than money			2
ironically , it now seems it will be money -- through the economic impact of climate change and resource constraint -- that will motivate the sweeping changes necessary to avert catastrophe			1
the reason is we have now reached a moment where four words -- the earth is full -- will define our times			2
this is not a philosophical statement ; this is just science based in physics , chemistry and biology			0
there are many science - based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we 're living beyond our means			0
the eminent scientists of the @entity32 , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 @entity33 to sustain this economy			1
in other words , to keep operating at our current level , we need 50 % more @entity33 than we 've got			1
watch @entity38 's @entity37 in financial terms , this would be like always spending 50 % more than you earn , going further into debt every year			1
but of course , you ca n't borrow natural resources , so we 're burning through our capital , or stealing from the future			0
while they use different words , leaders and experts around the world are acknowledging this			0
@entity55 environment minister @entity54 said last year , " the depletion , deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the worsening ecological environment have become bottlenecks and grave impediments to ( our ) economic and social development			1
" if i had said that in the ' 90s , when i was the global head of @entity66 , it would have been dismissed as doom - and - gloom extremism ! @entity37 : how we wrecked the ocean even the previous heresy , that economic growth has limits , is on the table			1
belief in infinite growth on a finite planet was always irrational , but it is the nature of denial to ignore hard evidence			1
now denial is evaporating , even in the financial markets			0
as influential fund manager @entity80 of @entity81 says : " the fact is that no compound growth is sustainable			1
if we maintain our desperate focus on growth , we will run out of everything and crash			1
" or as peak oil expert @entity88 argues , we are moving beyond peak oil and into " peak everything			0
" despite this emerging understanding , the growth concept is so deeply ingrained in our thinking that we will keep pushing economic growth as hard as we can , at whatever cost is required			1
as a result , the crisis will be big , it will be soon , and it will be economic , not environmental			1
the fact is the planet will take further bludgeoning , further depleting its capital , but the economy can not -- so we 'll respond not because the environment is under great threat , but because the science and economics shows that something far more important to us is jeopardized -- economic growth			1
@entity37 : the biggest health threat facing women a good indicator is that , despite the recession of the past few years , oil and food prices are approaching record highs again , driven by underlying , long - term trends that even a recession ca n't slow down			0
@entity80 calls this " the most important economic event since the @entity121			2
" Â if serious growth returns , the resulting resource price spikes , particularly oil and food , will soon kill it again			2
as a result , what we are facing is not a few bad years of slow growth like this past recession , but a fundamental shift -- the end of cheap resources and an environment in a state of collapse			1
even normally cautious bodies like the @entity139 and the @entity140 are sounding the alarm , with the latter recently releasing a comprehensive report forecasting a world in 2050 that will be defined by resource constraint and its economic impacts			2
they even dare to ask : " will the growth process undermine itself ? " @entity37 : @entity149 says abundance is our future so when this crisis hits , will we respond or will we simply slide into collapse ? crisis elicits a powerful human response , whether it be personal health , natural disaster , corporate crisis or national threat			1
previously immovable barriers to change quickly disappear			1
in this case , the crisis will be global and will manifest as the end of economic growth , thereby striking at the very heart of our model of human progress			1
while that will make the task of ending denial harder , it also means what 's at risk is , quite simply , everything we hold to be important			0
the last time this happened was @entity181 , and our response to that is illustrative of both the denial and delay process and the likely form our response to this crisis will take			1
@entity37 : the global power shift when we look at history we tend to see the progress of events as inevitable , but it was rarely so at the time			0
indeed , the @entity194 's powerful response to @entity195 and the @entity196 ' equally extraordinary mobilization after @entity198 both followed long years of denial and debate			2
many argued that the threat was n't that great , the response would be too expensive to afford , the public would n't support it			2
sound familiar ? but when the response came , when the scale of the threat was finally accepted , our response was breathtaking			2
as @entity209 told his country : " it is no use saying , ' we are doing our best			0
' you have got to succeed in doing what is necessary			0
" with denial gone , governments knew what was " necessary			0
" they directed industry to support the war -- banning civilian auto production just four days after @entity198			0
they raised massive amounts of money to fund investment and technology research at an extraordinary scale -- indeed , @entity196 spending on the war rose from 1.6 % of @entity231 in 1940 to 37 % just five years later			0
to achieve this , they curtailed personal consumption and drove remarkable behavior change to free up financial and other resources for the war effort			2
do you find this hard to imagine today ? then try to imagine the alternative -- that in a collapsing global economy and society we will stand by and simply watch the slide			0
there is no precedent in modern history on which to base that conclusion and plenty of evidence for the alternative			0
@entity251 may be slow , but we are not stupid			0
get ready for the great disruption			0
Â the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity38 .			1

@entity38 : the demands we place on the environment far *exceed* its *capacity*
he says we are heading for a day when economic growth will reach its limit on @entity33
it makes sense to start planning for changes needed to adapt to the coming crisis , he says
@entity271 : allies ' response in @entity181 showed our *capability* to change quickly and survive
