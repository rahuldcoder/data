-- this year around 300,000 visitors are expected to attend the @entity3 's @entity2 , the world 's largest and most important furniture fair			1
at the moment it seems like half of them are trying to get into the lavish exhibition space set up by @entity11			0
the men guarding the entrance resemble bouncers , albeit with smaller necks , better fitting suits , and a habit of calling strangers sir or madam			0
after i flash my press credentials they let me beyond the velvet rope			0
apparently @entity0 is on the list			0
every year the good and the great of the furniture world descend on @entity3 for its @entity2 , an extravaganza of design and a focal point of the design calendar			1
retailers come to decide which pieces they will stock for the following year , and journalists arrive en masse to get ideas for features and editorial spreads			0
designers and their teams come for a bit of inspiration — and to eye up the competition			0
this year 1,400 exhibitors — including furniture heavyweights like @entity11 , @entity45 , and @entity46 , and kitchen experts like @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 — are displaying their latest designs and innovations			1
their various booths , which sometimes resemble free - standing stores , stretch out over 152,300 square meters of exhibition space			1
that 's equivalent to 27 football fields filled with sofas , armchairs , carpets and ovens			1
this year 's exhibition , which concludes on april 13 , is the most extravagant yet			1
" over the past few years the mood at the fair has been quite subdued and there have n't been that many notable launches , " says @entity63 , editor - at - large for @entity66 @entity65			1
" but there seems to be renewed confidence in the global economy			0
this year the pace is more upbeat , frenetic and it 's all about the sell			1
" inside @entity76 @entity11 's booth resembles a @entity11 store with its dark wood floors and black - and - gold wall hangings			1
" the shops stay in place for four or five years , but the booth is here for just five days , " says @entity81 , the vice-president of the @entity82 , the @entity84 lifestyle brand that produces furniture for @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
" inside this box we 're not only showing furniture			1
we 're showing a lifestyle			2
" and what a glamorous lifestyle it is			0
an attractive public relations manager guides me through the showroom to a high - back cocoon sofa , created by guest designer @entity103 , which retails from $ 25,000			2
then there 's a 13 - ft. mirror , which includes a built - in 30 - inch or 42 - inch television set			1
it starts from $ 20,000 and can climb to $ 35,000			0
eventually we reach the " cat pouf " ottoman			0
it 's covered in leather with a stained wengé base			2
her eyes light up when she tells me it was inspired by a @entity11 handbag , party , party everywhere later that evening i follow the masses to @entity3 's @entity123 , a 16th century palace that has been converted into an exhibition and party space by designjunction , a group that showcases the latest furniture , lighting and product design from around the world			1
if the walls could talk they would likely whisper about the eccentric personalities downing champagne and ogling over @entity138 carpets and pot scrubbers made from watermelon rinds			2
in the courtyard i interrupt a conversation between a @entity144 furniture enthusiast and an @entity146 interior designer			2
" i do n't keep a schedule — i just run from one place to another and then when someone calls me i run to another show or party , " says @entity148 , the chief executive and creative director of @entity150 , a leading home interiors and furniture retailer in @entity152			2
he describes his annual journey to @entity3 as a " design pilgrimage " and says the fair presents an unparalleled opportunity to connect with his far - flung business contacts			1
it 's also a chance to spot the pieces that will appeal to his well - heeled customers in @entity146			1
" when it comes to fashion you can choose between @entity172 fashion , @entity174 fashion , @entity176 fashion , @entity178 fashion , " @entity148 says			0
" when it comes to furniture you 've got @entity84 , @entity84 , @entity84 and maybe the fourth is from somewhere else			2
" welcome to the club for up and coming designers , the @entity2 is an essential way to get your name out there			1
" personal relationships are everything in this business , " says @entity63 of @entity66			0
" it may look like a series of parties but it 's actually big business			1
designers will often secure a huge commission or brand partnership over a drink at @entity197			0
it 's the place where everyone goes			2
" designer @entity200 set up his label made in @entity202 last year			0
he debuted five new pieces in @entity3 this week			1
but rather than setting up inside designjunction or another collective space , he chose to rent out a trendy café and bar in @entity3 's @entity208 and stocked it with his own furniture			1
" we want it to be a social space where people can feel comfortable , have a coffee and interact with the pieces , " he says			0
" the pieces are very tactile			0
" so visitors eat spaghetti at his supernova trestle table , cast entirely from recycled aluminum			0
they also sit on his @entity223 stackable stools , which are made from recycled drinking bottles			0
he 's less concerned with securing orders than he is with making new contacts			2
" we 've already had architects , retailers , and distributors come through the space , " @entity200 says			0
" this is where those important connections are made			0
we 'll start imagining what we 'll do next year before we even leave @entity3			1

around 300,000 furniture enthusiasts gather in @entity3 for @entity2
over 1300 exhibitors showing off grand designs at @entity3 's furniture fair
event is filled with champagne galas , *over-the* - top parties , and plenty of grand unveilings
