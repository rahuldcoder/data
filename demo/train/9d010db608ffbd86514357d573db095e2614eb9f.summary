-- for me @entity2 's passing is the end of an era			2
@entity6 gave me my first break as a songwriter , as a front man , as a recording artist and as a touring artist , and for that i will always be grateful			1
the first @entity13 album was the first album i ever recorded and it still stands as one of the best recordings i have ever been a part of			1
i wrote songs with him , but it was his trip			2
he 's the guy that got me to sing with him			2
i had no experience whatsoever ; i just wrote the first four songs in my life , which were " @entity30 , " " @entity31 , " " one thing on my mind , " and " i do n't want it , " played them for @entity2 upon first meeting , shook my hand , and said , " let 's start a band			2
" i went from zero to a hundred			2
i saw him at @entity36 with the @entity37 , [ touring in support of ] @entity40 , with " @entity41 " and " @entity42			1
" i did n't know who he was ; i did n't know anything about him			2
i had a soul band -- we were playing @entity48 and @entity49 -- and we sat there and watched @entity37			2
i told my guitar player , " i want you to be like that " -- like @entity6			1
and he 's going , " i do n't want to play that kind of music , " and i 'm going , " well , i do			0
" we got into it			0
it broke my band up , seeing @entity2 for the first time			0
@entity60 said , " i 'm going to be like that guy			0
i 'm going to play guitar like that and i 'm going to sing like ... the way i sing			0
" i was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show , and he said , " that 's @entity6 , and that was his last show			1
" i lived in @entity71 , and i said , " do you have his address ? " because i did n't even have a phone			0
he gave it to me , and i went and knocked on his door , dressed like @entity77 -- big old high heel platform shoes , satin pants , probably had make - up on , with a @entity81 and a notebook pad with all kinds of lyrics in it			1
@entity60 said , " i 'm @entity86			1
i heard you 're looking for a singer			0
" he said , " come on in			0
you got any songs ? " i played him my four songs , we shook hands , and he said , " let 's start a band			0
do you know any drummers ? i 've got a bass player , @entity98			0
" i had a drummer , @entity99 -- was n't in my band , but he was my favorite drummer around town			2
within a month we were signed to @entity103 , @entity104 producing , and the first @entity13 album was born a month after that			1
it was the fastest thing i 've ever done in my life			0
like i said , i went from zero to a hundred in the blink of an eye -- all because of @entity2			2
@entity2 never liked to stick with anything			0
we made one of the greatest hard rock / heavy metal albums of all time with that first @entity13 album , and then he did n't want to do that anymore			1
" nah , nah , we 've got to have better songs , we 've got to change our image , that kind of music is out			0
" boy , he was just laying it on us			0
@entity2 really liked to change -- immediately			2
we butted heads and i got thrown out of the band [ after one more album , 1974 's @entity129 ] , but i carried on with that " first @entity6 " i saw			1
what i learned from @entity6 , i still utilize today when i step on a stage			1
i try to keep the energy up and the entertainment high			0
the first time @entity135 and i met , it was around 1977			0
we were on a stadium show with @entity138 , @entity139 , myself , @entity135			0
he came to my dressing room , and said , " i 'm a @entity13 freak , i love the band ! " and @entity104 told me , when he signed @entity135 , they were called something else , and he wanted to name them after the guitar player			1
he said on the first @entity135 record , he took the first @entity13 record in there and said , " boom			1
we 're going to have eight great songs , they 're going to be this long , they 're going to be this tempo			0
" and pretty much patterned the whole thing after it -- right down to saying , " why do n't you guys get @entity86 to sing in this band ? he 's been thrown out of @entity13			1
" that 's a true story ! @entity135 had a totally new twist on the whole guitar style thing , but as far as the chording goes -- not his soloing as much as the chording -- yeah , he took some of that big open chord thing [ from @entity13 ]			1
the big open a , the big open @entity170 , the big open @entity171 as open as you could make it , to make it as heavy as possible with one guitar			2
and that was pretty much @entity2 's style , too			0
and of course the fire , too -- @entity135 came out with all that fire , which is @entity2			2
@entity2 was full of fire , man			2
[ i last spoke to @entity13 ] a couple of weeks ago , and about a week before that , and then four or five days before that			1
we were talking a lot , because we were planning a @entity13 reunion for my birthday in @entity189 this year			1
@entity13 , the whole band , has not been there			1
@entity99 's been there , @entity98 's been there , @entity2 's been there -- but [ the whole band together ] has never been there			1
i said to @entity2 , " come on , man			2
we 're all getting old			0
let 's do this again while we can			0
" and he was in , we were all in			0
on my 65th , on october 13th , i was planning on coming out with @entity13 , doing the whole first album , then going in with my other band , and then bringing @entity201 out			1
i was going to try to [ cover ] my whole four decades for the fans that night , without nobody knowing			1
i even played back on my message box , february 10th -- " @entity206 , @entity207 ... call me back ! " it was all good			1
it 's f * * * ed up that those songs will never be played by those four members again			0
songs can go forever , but we ca n't			0
[ i would like @entity13 to be remembered ] as one of the pioneers of @entity217 heavy / hard rock			1
and certainly , one of the great hard rock guitar players			1
but he was more than that -- he was really versatile			1
but if you 're going to remember him for anything , put on that first @entity13 record			1
the only positive i can grab onto is the fact that the music will live on			0
it 's a shame to lose @entity2 and i 'm so sorry for his loved ones			0
