-- @entity1 says it will recall 630,000 newer model @entity2 worldwide to fix a software glitch in its side airbag and seat belt mechanism and transmission fluid leak problems			1
no accidents or injuries happened because of these defects			0
but it refuses to recall 2.7 million older jeep models with a fire hazard that the @entity14 says caused more than 50 people to burn to death			1
@entity1 's refusal to comply with the highway administration 's request to recall 2.7 million 1993 to 2004 @entity20 and 2002 to 2007 @entity22 models puts profits over safety , putting people who ride in them everyday at risk of their car being hit from behind and going up in flames			1
these modern day @entity30 for soccer moms have been involved in 37 rear - impact fatal fire crashes			0
fifty - one people burned to death in those crashes , according to the @entity14			1
compare that with the @entity37 : 26 people died in @entity37 rear impact fires before it was recalled in 1978			0
a recall would cost @entity1 no more $ 300 million to fix the problems and return the suvs			1
@entity1 would not exist today but for a $ 10 billion bailout loan from the @entity46 government			1
as a return for the bailout , @entity1 should spend a fraction of that to recall the @entity2			1
the refusal to recall these rolling firebombs is an insult to @entity46 tax payers and @entity1 's @entity2 customers			1
the @entity20 is 21 times more likely to be involved in a fatal rear impact crash in which fire is the cause of death than its biggest competitor , the @entity60			0
the @entity2 crashes in which people died in fires were readily survivable crashes			1
a rear impact crash at 70 mph in a vehicle similar in size to these @entity2 is no more severe than that of a front barrier crash at 35 mph , performed in the traffic administration 's 5 - @entity69			1
large seat backs spread the force of the crash better than small airbags , making 80 mph rear impacts survivable			0
but a car crashing into the rear of these @entity2 can rupture their fuel tanks at speeds less than the 50 mph rear - impact standard			2
the @entity82 conducted a 40 mph rear impact crash test of a 1996 @entity20 in which the @entity2 's tank ruptured and spilled all the fuel			2
the 50 mph standard has 35 % more energy than the @entity82 's 40 mph test			0
the @entity20 and @entity22 fuel tanks hang lower than the rear bumper , so they are particularly vulnerable to low - speed hits from vehicles that are lower to the ground			0
many low - profile cars have sloping front ends that can directly hit the tank			0
even 10 mph rear impacts crush the not - so - protective brush guard			0
in 1978 , @entity1 engineers cited the safety benefits of placing the fuel tank in front of the rear axle and noted that placing the fuel tank behind the rear axle in @entity43 may require a shield because of bumper mismatch			1
@entity1 moved the fuel tank in front of the rear axle in the 2005 @entity20 and in the @entity22			2
there has not been a single fire death in a rear impact of the newer jeeps with the more protected fuel tank location in all the years since			2
the devastating effect of the fire defects in these @entity2 models is that children riding in the back of @entity2 have been killed and injured			2
@entity1 sold these jeeps as family vehicles			2
parents put their kids in child seats in the back because that 's safer			0
tragically , children have been trapped in the seats and suffered horrible burns and deaths because they could be pulled out in time			0
@entity132 ceo @entity131 -- @entity1 is a subsidiary of @entity132 -- and @entity1 ceo @entity133 are good people with families who should respond to the tragic deaths of their customers and could order a recall today			1
they owe it to the @entity46 public			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			0

@entity1 recalls jeeps for software fix , but not models in which 51 people burned to death
@entity143 : company putting *occupants* of these models at risk of vehicle going up in flames
@entity143 : refusing to recall these 2.7 million @entity2 puts profits over safety
he says @entity1 was bailed out by *taxpayers* for $ 10 billion ; recall would cost $ 300 million
