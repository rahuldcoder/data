@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 has set the standard on the football pitch in recent months , now the league 's bank accounts are the envy of @entity9 after a report declared the competition to be the continent 's most profitable			1
the @entity13 continues to lead the way in terms of revenue , raking in $ 3.8 billion for the 2011 - 12 season , according to sports business group @entity18			1
but the @entity3 league bests its rivals with combined profits of $ 242 million , compared to $ 154 million for the @entity13			1
the profit of clubs in the @entity2 remained the same despite a drop in overall revenue to $ 2.36 billion for 2011 - 12 season , compared to $ 2.56 billion a year earlier			1
the @entity2 's booming balance sheets reflect the division 's recent on - field dominance			1
runners - up in 2012 , @entity30 were crowned kings of @entity9 in may after beating @entity33 in the first all - @entity35 final			0
" the reason the @entity2 is more profitable than the @entity13 really comes down to the regulations that @entity3 football authorities have in place , " @entity36 , a director at @entity18 , told @entity1			1
" they have a much stronger central control over the ownership and financial models of clubs			0
" @entity36 says there are two main aspects to rulings which enable @entity3 clubs to maximize their profits			2
" firstly , the regulations constrain the club 's costs , and hence wage costs , as the clubs are limited in terms of how much they can spend in terms of wages - to - revenue ratio			0
" secondly , the regulations on club ownerships and the restrictions on external owners mean @entity3 clubs do not have the levels of extra contributions that we have seen in @entity67			0
" over the last 5 - 6 years in @entity67 , there has been an extra $ 3 billion of money injected into clubs , which can be used to fund a higher level of wage costs			2
" so without the influence of incredibly wealthy figures such as @entity77 ( @entity78 ) and @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , @entity2 clubs spend 51 % of their total revenue on wages			2
this is significantly lower than the 70 % figure splashed out by @entity67 sides			0
the @entity13 's continued growth is also tempered by debt			0
the combined debt of the 20 teams in @entity67 's top flight is $ 3.8 billion , a figure that is identical to the league 's total revenue			1
however , @entity36 believes the servicing of clubs ' debts is not the issue it once was			0
" a few years ago , debt was much more of a story but this year it has nudged downwards again , " he explained			0
" debt levels are going down and the costs of servicing the debt are going down as well			0
" in round numbers , the cost to @entity13 clubs servicing their debts is $ 125 million			1
" the reason for the relatively meager figure on debts of $ 3.8 billion is because $ 2.2 billion of that total has been provided by the financial backers of various clubs in the form of non-interest bearing " soft loans			1
" with new financial regulations from @entity9 coming into play next season as well as an increased television deal that brings an extra $ 925 million to the @entity13 , @entity67 clubs have the opportunity to increase profits next season			2
while that may please their accountants , fans will -- as ever -- be far more concerned about boosting the footballing fortunes of their favorites in the year to come .			0
