@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 on saturday announced @entity5 rep. @entity4 of @entity6 as his running mate for the @entity8 -- a bold and risky move that energized both conservatives and their opponents			1
@entity4 is a rising @entity12 star and the party 's leader on fiscal and budget issues			1
he said he is overwhelmed by the reaction to the announcement that he is @entity3 's running mate			2
" i was amazed at the energy , the crowd , people who just want to see us take the country in a different direction , " @entity4 said			2
" it 's very exciting			0
we 're going to win this campaign			0
we 've got the wind behind us			0
i 'm really excited about this race			0
" how @entity3 campaign kept @entity4 tap under wraps @entity4 is the architect of a @entity12 spending plan that would overhaul many entitlement programs , making him a favorite of conservatives , whose support for @entity3 , the presumptive @entity12 presidential nominee , has been shaky			1
" you saw the response of our crowds , very excited to meet @entity4 to get to know him , " @entity3 said			1
" a lot of them know him pretty well by virtue of things he 's been fighting for , but it just means one more person to drive a very strong message			0
" but the @entity3 camp was also quick to put some distance between @entity4 's initial budget blueprint and his own			1
" gov. @entity3 applauds @entity4 for going in the right direction with his budget , " the campaign said , " and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance			1
" his running mate choice draws some clear lines with @entity3 's @entity65 opponents over the size of the cuts in @entity4 's plan and his prior votes on taxes , which they say favor the wealthiest @entity5 -- a point of contention in an election in which both sides consider themselves champions of the middle class			1
" congressman @entity4 is an outstanding choice as our country 's next vice president , and today 's announcement demonstrates governor @entity3 's commitment to returning fiscal sanity back to @entity90 , @entity90 , " said former @entity79 sen. @entity78 , who mounted the strongest conservative challenge to @entity3 's campaign in the @entity12 primaries			1
" i have long supported @entity4 's fiscal and entitlement reforms to return our country back on a path of fiscal health			2
" @entity4 , 42 , is considered a policy wonk and conservative @entity97 likely to energize the @entity12 base and sharpen the campaign 's focus on government spending and the economy			1
that could boost @entity3 's appeal among @entity97 voters in battleground states such as @entity107 and @entity79 , though @entity4 offers little in the way of foreign policy experience			1
the @entity111 chairman was chosen ahead of sen. @entity112 of @entity113 , former @entity115 gov. @entity114 and sen. @entity116 of @entity107			0
a campaign aide told @entity2 that @entity3 decided on @entity4 on august 1			1
@entity12 sources said friday that the latter three had all been told that they would n't be getting the nod			2
meanwhile , vice president @entity120 contacted @entity4 , welcoming him to the race , saying that he " looked forward to engaging him on the clear choice voters face this november			1
" and @entity65 were quick to make @entity4 's fiscal policies a target			2
analysis : a bold but risky choice for running mate " congressman @entity4 and @entity3 are a match made in millionaires ' heaven , but they 'll be a nightmare for seniors who 've earned their @entity139 benefits , " said @entity130 rep. @entity129 , chairman of @entity131 , " for the last 18 months , we 've said @entity12 will have to defend the indefensible -- their vote to end @entity139			1
now with congressman @entity4 on the ticket , @entity8 @entity12 face the one thing they hoped to avoid -- a national debate on their budget that puts millionaires first and @entity139 and the middle class last			1
" the announcement comes at the end of a week in which @entity65 continued relentless attacks on @entity3 over his refusal to reveal more of his tax records and which saw three polls in 24 hours showing @entity154 with a growing lead over his @entity12 challenger			1
a @entity2 / @entity158 poll released thursday showed a big jump in those who had an unfavorable opinion of the @entity12 candidate			2
while some analysts saw @entity3 's choice as risky , others thought @entity3 had to go big			2
" with @entity3 losing ground to president @entity154 in the polls , i do n't see the selection of @entity4 as ' risky , ' i see the choice as bold and necessary , " @entity12 consultant @entity166 told @entity2			1
timeline : @entity4 through the years @entity2 senior political analyst @entity172 says the @entity4 pick is " an opportunity for the @entity3 campaign to go on the offense			1
" @entity4 , appearing with @entity3 in @entity0 , @entity1 , at the beginning of a four - day , four - state bus tour moved quickly to position himself and @entity3 as champions of voters dissatisfied with the economy and to draw his own contrasts with president @entity154			1
" we wo n't duck the tough issues , we will lead ! " @entity4 told a cheering crowd on the battleship @entity188			2
" we wo n't blame others , we will take responsibility			0
we wo n't replace our founding principles , we will reapply them			0
" " i hear some people say that this is just ' the new normal			0
' higher unemployment , declining incomes and crushing debt is not a new normal			0
it 's the result of misguided policies			0
and next january , our economy will begin a comeback with the @entity3 plan for a stronger middle class that will lead to more jobs and more take - home pay for working @entity5			2
" @entity3 called @entity206 " who " believes in the worth and dignity of every human life			0
" he lauded the fifth - generation @entity188 native serving his seventh term in @entity213 as " an intellectual leader of the @entity12 " and a person who will help lead the country " to widespread and shared prosperity			0
" @entity3 introduced his running mate saying that his " integrity is unquestioned and his word is good			0
" @entity4 , top @entity12 voice on fiscal matters but @entity3 , 65 , initially flubbed his big line , announcing , " join me in welcoming the next president of the @entity5 , @entity4 ! " he recovered moments later when @entity4 took the stage , saying , " every now and then , i 'm known to make a mistake			1
i did not make a mistake with this guy , but i can tell you this : he 's going to be the next vice president of the @entity5			0
" at a later stop in @entity235 , @entity1 , @entity4 picked up again on the economy			0
to choruses of " no " from the crowd , @entity4 asked , " do you think the economy is heading in the right direction ? do you think we 're getting our debt and deficit under control ? do you think the country is on the right track ? " " do you know why ? he asked			0
" because president @entity154 is our president and he has put all of his policies in place and they 're just not working			0
" @entity3 then took the microphone , touting energy independence , improved worker skills and enhanced trade opportunities			0
first , he drew cheers for his choice of @entity4			2
" if you said one word about @entity4 it would probably be leader , " @entity3 said			1
" this is a man who learned leadership young because leadership is a function of character and courage			1
" accolades on the veep choice poured in from @entity12			2
in a statement , senate republican leader @entity270 called @entity4 , the @entity8 budget chairman , " a confirmation that gov. @entity3 is serious about strengthening @entity5 's economic future , tackling the deficits and debt that have skyrocketed under president @entity154 , and returning to a path to solvency and security			1
" @entity114 , in @entity279 , called @entity4 " a respected leader and a bold thinker regarding the changes needed to restore @entity5			0
" but the @entity154 campaign reacted to the announcement making familiar charges against the architect of @entity12 budget plans and tried to tie him to the incumbent 's predecessor , which is consistently blamed for the country 's economic doldrums			1
" in naming congressman @entity4 , @entity3 has chosen a @entity295 who shares his commitment to the flawed theory that new budget - busting tax cuts for the wealthy , while placing greater burdens on the middle class and seniors , will somehow deliver a stronger economy , " it said in a statement			1
" the architect of the radical @entity12 @entity8 budget , @entity4 , like @entity3 , proposed an additional $ 250,000 tax cut for millionaires , and deep cuts in education from @entity311 to college aid			1
his plan also would end @entity139 as we know it by turning it into a voucher system , shifting thousands of dollars in health care costs to seniors			0
as a member of @entity213 , @entity4 rubber - stamped the reckless @entity320 economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy			0
now the @entity324 ticket would take us back by repeating the same , catastrophic mistakes			0
" @entity65 attacks on @entity4 focus on changes to @entity139 and @entity328 the bus tour will take @entity3 through major media markets in four battleground states -- @entity1 , @entity332 , @entity113 and @entity107			1
@entity1 gov. @entity333 , once a potential running mate , introduced @entity3			0
@entity8 majority leader @entity335 , a @entity336 native , joined @entity3 at stops in the commonwealth on saturday			0
prior to saturday 's announcement , many @entity12 who spoke to @entity2 -- all of them granted anonymity to speak freely without angering @entity3 officials in @entity350 -- wondered why @entity3 would announce the pick on a weekend when millions of potential voters are likely to be distracted by the @entity353 , @entity340 golf , late - season baseball and the box office release of the latest @entity344 thriller			2
opinion : how @entity4 could help @entity3 what do you think of @entity3 selecting @entity4 as his running mate ? let us know on @entity359			2
