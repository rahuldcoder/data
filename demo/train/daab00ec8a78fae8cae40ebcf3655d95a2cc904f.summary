-- four years ago today , president @entity1 signed @entity2 into law , pledging that @entity4 could keep their health care plans and their doctors and that their coverage would be " more secure and stable " than before			1
as the horror stories continue to roll in , however , the emptiness of those promises and the human toll of this deeply misguided experiment have become increasingly difficult for @entity13 to ignore			0
consider @entity14 , a mother of five girls from @entity16 , @entity17			0
@entity14 was perfectly happy with the insurance and the doctor she had before @entity2			2
she also had an ironclad assurance from the president that she would n't have to sacrifice either one if his health care plan became law			1
now she finds herself among the growing group of @entity4 who 've been shell - shocked by the reality			2
the fact - checkers may have declared the president 's " you can keep your plan " pledge last year 's " lie of the year			1
" but @entity14 and millions like her will be reeling from that broken promise for years			1
it wo n't be easy			2
@entity14 not only lost her insurance , she also lost a trusted family doctor to @entity2			2
in a perfect summary of modern liberalism , one of the billing clerks for @entity17 's @entity2 exchange told @entity14 that since she now qualifies for @entity42 , she 'd be breaking the law if she tried to pay more out of her own pocket just to keep her old doctor			1
the upshot : for @entity14 and her family , it 's either @entity42 or a monthly premium increase of nearly $ 1,000			0
tragically , stories likes @entity14 's are playing out in households all across the country			0
and the promises that were made to sell @entity2 â € ” that it would n't disrupt people 's previous health care arrangements and that premiums would go down â € ” are now being exposed for the cheap and deceptive sales pitch they were			1
it may be tempting for some to brush all this aside as standard politics			0
but it 's hard to think of anything even comparable to the scope of the deception involved in selling this law			0
the president made repeated , explicit pledges that no one would lose their doctor or their plans as a result of this law			1
for two years , he did everything he could to assure @entity4 that they had nothing to worry about			1
yet now , as millions of @entity4 speak out about their frustrations and heartbreak , he 's not even listening			1
instead , leading @entity13 have engaged in a despicable campaign to discredit the victims			0
senate majority leader @entity82 labeled people like @entity14 liars , while other @entity13 have downplayed statistics that cast it in an unfavorable light			0
as for the president , he seems more interested in promoting his @entity90 bracket and talking up @entity2 's elusive virtues on satirical talk shows like " between the @entity93			1
" for the @entity99 @entity13 who gave us @entity2 , in other words , these stories about lost care , lost doctors , and higher costs are n't problems to be resolved , but political obstacles to be deflected			1
but there 's only so much they can do to tune out or brush aside the cascading impact of @entity2			1
in recent weeks , we 've heard calamitous reports of @entity2 patients being denied access to doctors , hospitals and premium cancer care centers			1
a recent analysis by the management consulting firm @entity114 found that only a fraction of the biggest local hospitals in a given coverage area will accept @entity2 patients			2
an @entity119 study found that only four of the 19 cancer centers it surveyed would give @entity2 patients access to its cancer care through the new @entity2 exchanges in their states			1
this is progress ? do n't tell that to @entity128 of @entity129 , @entity130			0
she 's another mom who 's been blindsided by the realities of @entity2			2
@entity128 told @entity0 that her son has a serious heart condition , but will now have to travel more than an hour to find a pediatric cardiologist who 's covered under her new plan			0
she does n't even want to think about what she 'll have to do in case of an emergency			0
" obviously we 'd have to pay out of pocket and go here in town , " she said , " but that defeats the purpose of insurance			0
" @entity128 's story raises a key question : what was the point of all this ? those who voted for @entity2 cling to the claim that they 've increased access			2
but as report after report has shown , increasing the ranks of the insured does n't necessarily guarantee access			0
it certainly did n't for @entity14 and @entity128			0
for many , the answer to all this is obvious : admit that @entity2 is a failure , repeal it , and work together on bipartisan , patient - centered solutions that correct the deficiencies in our previous system			2
but clearly , those who supported this law still need convincing			0
four years after @entity2 was signed into law , they still ca n't bring themselves to admit the reality all around us			1
@entity2 's human toll is getting worse every day			2
for the sake of people like @entity14 and @entity128 , we must			0
join us on @entity177 / @entity176			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity180 .			1

sen. @entity180 says that four years after the @entity2 was signed , many @entity4 still *struggle*
@entity183 points to president 's repeated claims that it would n't disrupt people 's existing health care plans
