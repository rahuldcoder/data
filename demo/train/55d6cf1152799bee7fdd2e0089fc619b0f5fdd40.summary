@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 made clear thursday that the @entity4 administration recognizes the authority of federal courts , including the @entity7 , to rule on whether the 2010 health care reform law or any other laws passed by @entity10 are constitutional			1
the declaration by @entity2 came in a letter to a federal appeal 's court that had ordered the government to respond by thursday in a legal and political spat over the health care law championed by president @entity4			1
the attorney general personally met the deadline with a three - page , single - spaced letter -- following the specific instructions of the 5th @entity22 , which is hearing a challenge to the health care law			1
@entity2 's letter affirmed the government 's stance that federal judges indeed have the authority to decide the fate of the @entity31 -- and any other law @entity10 passes			1
" the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute , " @entity2 said			1
read the letter ( @entity39 ) his personal involvement in crafting the response signaled the issue 's hot - button importance within the administration four days after @entity4 made controversial remarks that advised the @entity7 not to take an " unprecedented " step by overturning the health care reform law			1
@entity4 and the @entity48 have since attempted to clarify the president 's initial comments , which were in response to a reporter 's question about the @entity7 's three days of hearings on the health care law last week			1
however , @entity2 's letter made clear that the substance of @entity4 's remarks were in line with the administration 's recognition that the high court has the power of judicial review			1
" the president 's remarks were fully consistent with the principles described herein , " concluded @entity2 's letter			1
the dispute involving the court and the executive branch has highlighted the political dispute over whether the health care law will survive various legal challenges , including the pending @entity7 decision on the constitutionality of a key provision			1
the high court 's ruling , expected in june , would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals			2
the outcome of the health care cases in an election year could have a lasting impact on @entity4 's re-election chances as well as the credibility of the federal courts , which are supposed to be beyond politics			1
on monday , @entity4 said he was " confident that the @entity7 will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically - elected @entity10 , and i just remind conservative commentators that for years , what we 've heard is , the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint , that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a dually constituted and passed law			2
" some conservative critics interpreted those remarks as a challenge to judicial authority , suggesting @entity4 was putting political pressure on the high court			2
a day after the president 's initial remarks , the three @entity111 - appointed appellate judges held a hearing on a challenge to the health care law from physician - owned hospitals			1
judge @entity119 , a @entity120 appointee , was especially tough on a @entity122 lawyer defending the law and specifically mentioned the @entity4 remarks from the day before			2
" i 'm referring to statements by the president in the past few days to the effect , and i 'm sure you 've heard about them , that it is somehow inappropriate for what he termed ' unelected ' judges to strike acts of @entity10 that have enjoyed -- he was referring to , of course , @entity136 -- to what he termed broad consensus in majorities in both houses of @entity10 , " @entity119 said			0
" that has troubled a number of people who have read it as somehow a challenge to the federal courts or to their authority or to the appropriateness of the concept of judicial review , " @entity119 continued			2
" and that 's not a small matter			0
so i want to be sure that you 're telling us that the attorney general and the @entity122 do recognize the authority of the federal courts through unelected judges to strike acts of @entity10 or portions thereof in appropriate cases			1
" government lawyer @entity160 appeared initially taken aback , but replied such authority has existed for centuries			0
nevertheless , @entity119 and judges @entity163 and @entity164 then ordered the @entity122 to submit by noon thursday @entity165 time a three - page , single - spaced letter addressing whether the @entity4 administration believes courts do indeed enjoy that power			2
in a sign of the political nature of the imbroglio , @entity119 's phrasing in open court of the law as " @entity136 " used a term coined by opponents of the law			0
@entity2 's letter thursday offered repeated deference to the power of the federal courts			1
he said the @entity122 " has not in this litigation , nor in any other litigation of which i am aware , ever asked this or any other court to reconsider or limit long - established precedent concerning judicial review of the constitutionality of federal legislation			0
" legal analysts say the administration is walking a fine line in trying to tamp down criticism from legal and political circles			0
" there are two things going on , of course , " said @entity196 , a prominent @entity0 attorney , law professor , and publisher of @entity199			0
" @entity204 , @entity2 ( in the letter ) says that we have an argument courts ca n't hear this case			2
second , if you can hear the case , you certainly have the power to invalidate part of the statute as constitutional			0
but ( he says ) you should n't do that lightly			0
" the last part of @entity2 's letter " is how they are framing the president 's point -- that the courts need to give the elected branches deference , " @entity196 added			2
" it 's a respectful letter , but it has an element of , ' what are you talking about , the president never said that			0
' " the specific issue before the appeals court was a provision in the health care law restricting doctor - owned hospitals from expanding their facilities			1
the challenge was brought by an @entity165 spine - and - joint hospital , and the case is separate from the cases being considered by the @entity7			0
after his initial remarks monday proved controversial , @entity4 sought to clarify them tuesday			1
" the point i was making is that the @entity7 is the final say on our @entity240 and our laws , and all of us have to respect it , but it 's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature , our @entity10 , " @entity4 said			1
" and so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this			0
" the imbroglio continued thursday , with @entity254 minority leader @entity253 , @entity255 , using a @entity257 speech in @entity258 to tell @entity4 to " back off " and let the courts do their work without political interference			2
" the president crossed a dangerous line this week			0
and anyone who cares about liberty needs to call him out on it , " @entity264 said			0
" the independence of the court must be defended			0
regardless of how the justices decide this case , they 're answerable , above all , to the @entity240 they swore to uphold			0
the fact that this president does not appear to feel similarly constrained to respect their independence does n't change that one bit			0
so respectfully , i would suggest the president back off			0
" even @entity4 's former @entity283 professor and mentor , @entity285 , said the president " obviously misspoke , " telling the @entity287 that " i do n't think anything was gained by his making these comments and i do n't think any harm was done , except by public confusion			1
" meanwhile , @entity48 press secretary @entity293 faced skeptical reporters thursday just before @entity2 's letter arrived at the appeals court			2
@entity293 said it was " preposterous " to suggest @entity4 does not respect the power of courts to rule on the constitutionality of legislation			2
" it is kind of ridiculous to believe that the president was n't talking about the context of the ( health care ) case , but i completely concede that he did not describe the context when he took the question and answered it on monday , " @entity293 said			1
two years ago , @entity4 attracted similar outcry when he criticized the high court 's conservative majority for striking down a campaign finance reform law , giving corporations greater power to spend in federal elections			1
some conservative legal sources privately expressed disappointment in the appeals court 's order this week , saying it appeared punitive and petty to demand the @entity122 defend a position it had never disputed in court			0
" it was like he ( the judge ) was giving a homework assignment to an unprepared student , " said one right - leaning lawyer , who opposes the health care law			1
" it has the effect of putting the judiciary on the defensive , and could give rise to concerns the courts will look at the law from a political , not constitutional , perspective			0
" the @entity7 held three days of oral arguments on the health care last week			1
the justices have not , and by custom will not , comment on pending appeals			0
their written opinions , due in the next three months , will be the final word on the @entity136 's constitutionality , particularly the " individual mandate " provision that requires most @entity347 to have health insurance by 2014 or face a financial penalty			0
@entity1 's @entity351 , @entity352 and @entity353 contributed to this report .			0
