@entity0 , @entity1 -- attackers wielding rockets and machine guns in northwestern @entity1 struck a @entity8 convoy carrying fuel to @entity10 , a local police chief said on wednesday			1
@entity11 , the police chief of @entity13 district in @entity15 province , said 17 oil tankers and four containers were all set ablaze			1
this convoy was parked on side of the road , and convoys are generally operated by contracting @entity1 logistics firms , using local trucks and drivers			2
this is the latest strike on @entity10 - bound supply convoys in @entity1			1
@entity26 , the central spokesman for @entity1 @entity27 , said a special squad designated to strike @entity8 supply efforts made the attack near @entity31 , @entity1			1
the @entity1 @entity27 has claimed responsibility for an earlier attack on oil tankers , a spokesman for the militant group told @entity2 by phone wednesday			1
@entity31 police said 20 oil tankers parked near that city were set ablaze wednesday , and one person died in the attack			1
@entity43 , a senior @entity31 police official , said more than 12 gunmen in three vehicles opened fire on the tanker trucks			1
he said the person who died was killed in the shooting			0
@entity43 said the gunmen also threw petrol bombs on the trucks			0
of the 20 tankers that caught fire , nine were destroyed			0
at least five other attacks have been carried out on vehicles carrying supplies for @entity8 forces in the past week , leaving at least six people dead			0
the @entity1 @entity27 has also claimed responsibility for two of the earlier attacks on convoys			1
" the oil and the machinery is for logistic support to the @entity8 forces who killed our innocent sisters and brothers in @entity10 , which we would never allow , " @entity26 said wednesday			2
@entity1 closed the main land route for @entity8 supplies crossing from @entity1 to @entity10 -- known as the @entity74 border -- after @entity76 helicopter strikes across the border killed two @entity1 soldiers			1
a report from a @entity8 and @entity1 assessment team concluded that soldiers fired warning shots to let them know of their presence , but the helicopter crews assumed they were insurgents and fired the shots			2
" two coalition helicopters passed into @entity1 airspace several times			0
subsequently , the helicopters fired on a building later identified as a @entity1 border outpost , in response to shots fired from the post			0
the assessment team considered it most probable that they had fired in an attempt to warn the helicopters of their presence			0
unfortunately , following the engagement , it was discovered that the dead and wounded were members of the @entity101 , " @entity8 's @entity98 said			0
a second supply route through @entity103 -- in the western province of @entity105 -- is open , but the @entity1 @entity27 is threatening violence on any route used for @entity8 purposes			1
" our special squad will make [ the ] supply line to @entity8 through @entity103 border as impossible as we did in @entity74 border , " @entity26 said wednesday			1
@entity43 , the police official , said authorities have also felt an impact			2
" after closing of the @entity74 border for @entity8 supplies , pressure on the @entity103 border has become almost doubled , which is creating security problems for us , " he said			1
@entity26 said this week that the earlier @entity1 @entity27 attacks were carried out as revenge for drone strikes and @entity8 's attacks in @entity1			1
" @entity76 and @entity8 forces are killing innocent @entity1 , which is unacceptable , and we will teach them a lesson by such attacks , " @entity26 said			2
supply convoys are important for the @entity10 war effort			0
coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from @entity1 to bring in supplies and gear			0
in @entity137 tuesday , @entity136 spokesman @entity135 said that attacks on fuel convoys interrupt a tiny fraction of @entity76 war supplies			0
" there have been attacks historically on @entity8 convoys passing through @entity1 to @entity10			2
and they are sometimes sensational and they are sometimes horrific and they are sometimes deadly and that is tragic , " @entity135 said			0
" but if you put this in context and in perspective , we 're talking about ... impacting about 1 percent of the supplies that we funnel through @entity1 into @entity10			0
" @entity2 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
