@entity0 -- @entity2 was a senior spokesman for @entity4 's 2008 presidential campaign but he says his new job as communications director for the @entity7 has nothing to do with his former boss ' plans for 2016			1
" this has nothing to do with @entity4			1
i do n't know if @entity4 is going to run again			1
i suspect she does n't know yet if she 's going to run , " he said			2
@entity2 , a strategist who also played key roles in @entity19 's 2000 presidential bid , @entity22 's 2004 @entity21 campaign , and @entity23 victories by @entity24 and @entity25 in @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity28 , is confident the @entity29 can hold the @entity23 and make @entity21 and gubernatorial pickups in next year 's midterm elections			1
and he says the @entity7 's debt wo n't hinder such efforts			1
since starting on the job friday , @entity2 has already hit the cable circuit , appearing on @entity1 's " @entity36 " and @entity39 's " hardball with @entity38			1
" on monday @entity2 talked to @entity1 about his new job			1
@entity41 : @entity42 did @entity43 a huge favor q : what is the @entity7 's mission this cycle ? a : our mission is pretty straightforward			1
it is to support the president 's agenda and it is to support @entity7 candidates up and down the ticket in 2013 and 2014			1
i think we are well positioned to do that			0
we 're doing it on a bunch of different levels , with the communications shop providing communications assistance , but also at the organizing level , helping state parties do the same			2
so we 're just going to be very aggressive on both those fronts and there 's a lot of work to do on both those fronts			2
q : with @entity72 , which has a strong grassroots outreach program , no longer part of the @entity7 , is the party committee going to be less of a player when it comes to grassroots outreach ? a : no. i only think you 're going to see it step up our grassroots operation , for a couple of reasons			1
one , there 's plenty of grassroots work to go around			0
but two , you have to remember , @entity72 is a non-political entity , and so the @entity7 is still the place to be for political organizing on the @entity7 side and i think everybody is committed to seeing that continue to happen			1
q : let 's talk money			0
it 's no secret that the @entity99 is having a great year when it comes to fundraising			0
the @entity99 does n't have any debt			0
the @entity7 incurred a lot of debt in winning last year 's election			1
when it comes to money are there concerns that you wo n't have the cash to do what you need to do and how will you retire that debt ? a : a couple of things			0
one , you 're right -- we went into debt to win , we did			0
the other side is having a good year			0
they will likely have more money that us this cycle , but remember , they had more money than us last cycle			0
the @entity126 , the @entity126 and affiliated groups drastically outspent @entity29 and affiliated groups last time and it did n't work			1
so it is n't all about the money			0
but sure , it is an important part of it			0
we are going to have what we need to accomplish our goals this cycle , but we 're still working to retire that debt and @entity29 can help us out by going to @entity139 and giving what they can			2
q : what are your goals this cycle			0
are there specifics you can share ? a : we want to hold on to the @entity23			1
we want to win seats in the @entity21 and we want to win governorships			1
and i think there are a lot of places where we can do that			0
i think there are going to be a lot of competitive races			0
there are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats , we think			2
just looking at governors ' races , i think @entity26 is a huge opportunity for a @entity7 pickup			2
i think @entity168 and @entity169 are huge opportunities for @entity7 pickups			2
those are just governors ' seats			0
in the @entity23 we feel very comfortable that can hold the @entity23			1
and based on what i 'm seeing i think we feel comfortable that we can pick up seats in the @entity21			1
so we 're going to do what we can to support , we have some great @entity7 campaign committees out there , at the @entity178 , the @entity179 , the @entity180			1
they are doing the heavy lifting and at the @entity7 we are going to be helping them out however we can , while really helping to do what we can to help the president 's agenda			1
it 's all tied together			0
" q : there 's speculation , because of your role in @entity4 's 2008 presidential campaign , that this was part of some grand design to have someone from @entity195 take over communications at the @entity7 in advance of a possible second @entity43 bid for the @entity21			1
a : this has nothing to do with @entity4			2
i do n't know if @entity4 is going to run again			2
i suspect she does n't know yet if she 's going to run			0
but this has nothing to do with whether or not she 's going to run			0
i 'm over here because it 's a great opportunity to help all @entity29 , to help the party , to help the president			1
you know , 2016 will come soon enough , but before i came here to the @entity7 i was among those getting incredibly frustrated by the fact there was so much attention paid to 2016 when we 've got a lot of work to do before then			2
that 's why i 'm over here			0
we 've got important races in 2013			0
we 've got a lot of important races in 2014			0
folks need to start laying the groundwork for 2016 but there 's more important stuff to do now electorally as well as helping the president pass his agenda and that 's why i 'm here			0
" @entity42 not speculating on @entity4 presidential run q : after the midterms are over next year , could you see yourself back with @entity4 if she decides to launch another bid for the @entity21 ? a : i would n't be doing my job if i was looking much past 2014			1
right now that 's the goal , is to do what i can to help the party do as well as it can in the midterm elections			0
@entity243 daughter wants @entity4 to run			2
