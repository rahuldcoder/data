@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the front lines of @entity1 's war , rebel fighters say they are finding more than weapons on captured or killed soldiers loyal to ruler @entity8			1
rebels say they have confiscated cell phones that contain video showing @entity8 loyalists raping women and torturing people			1
@entity2 has obtained a copy of a video shot on a cell phone that appears to show a woman being sexually abused			1
the person who gave the video to @entity2 says it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a @entity8 loyalist			1
it shows two men in civilian clothes standing over a naked woman who is bent over with her face on the floor			1
the man standing behind her is sodomizing her with what appears to be a broomstick			0
" i ca n't bear it ! i ca n't bear it ! " the woman cries			2
" let 's push it farther , " a male voice says off - camera			0
" no , no , that 's enough ! " the woman begs			2
eventually , one of the men puts his sock - covered foot on her face			2
in @entity50 culture , that is considered a major insult			0
but in this case , it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring			0
arabic speakers who listened to the video at @entity2 's request say the voices have @entity62 accents			1
there is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms			1
@entity2 has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom			1
the person who gave it to @entity2 asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by @entity1 's conservative society			1
the @entity8 government did not respond to @entity2 requests for comment on the allegations of abuse			1
but officials have said in response to similar accusations in the past that the government has not been able to verify the claims and would " welcome " a fact - finding mission			0
an opposition spokesman says the video illustrates a pattern of abuse			2
" we were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic , " rebel spokesman @entity90 said			1
the rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said			1
he did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse			2
one of the most famous faces of @entity1 's revolution , @entity105 , dramatically claimed in march she had been gang - raped by @entity108 forces			1
she has since fled the country			0
a @entity1 psychologist who has conducted an investigation of her own says @entity114 's case is not unique			0
@entity115 says she has evidence of hundreds of cases of rape by @entity108 troops			1
she began her investigation after receiving phone calls from women who said they had been sexually assaulted			0
her survey of 50,000 people in refugee camps turned up 259 people who said they had been raped , she said last month			0
" they tie up my husband , they rape me in front of my husband and then they kill my husband , " @entity115 said one woman told her			2
" i 'm a psychologist and i 've seen lots of things , really			0
but sometimes after i leave some of these families i just sit in my car and cry because it 's really so painful , " she said			0
she has compiled a number of distressing images that she says demonstrate the abuse of alleged victims			0
one appears to show a cigarette burn on a woman 's breast , another a faded bite mark , while several others show the deep purple hue of nasty bruises			2
@entity115 shared her research , complete with pictures and recordings , with the @entity154 at @entity155 , @entity156 , where prosecutors are investigating accusations that the @entity8 regime has used rape as a tool of war			0
" the victims are starting to come out , " the court 's chief prosecutor , @entity163 , told @entity2 thursday			1
" but in our court the crimes are massive and the crimes we are charging @entity8 with are crimes against humanity , meaning a widespread and systematic attack -- in this case through rapes -- so we do n't need to prove one case ; we need to prove massive numbers of cases			0
" in this case , the evidence can be different			2
it could be soldiers who were given instructions on how to do it			0
the evidence could be doctors or psychologists who have spoken to the victims			2
that 's the kind of evidence we are collecting			2
" the court is still in the evidence - collecting stage , he said			2
for the video to be part of that evidence , its authenticity would have to be certified , he said			1
" these are interesting pieces , but it is n't the only way to put forward the case			0
for instance , we have some information of people saying that @entity8 himself was giving instructions			0
so if we can confirm this evidence , that will be enough to present this type of case as a crime against humanity -- as a widespread campaign of rapes			1
" @entity163 said he was hoping the judge would soon issue an arrest warrant for @entity8			0
" and then the challenge will be to arrest him , because arresting him will be the end to these crimes , " he said			0
rebel spokesman @entity90 , however , said some of the evidence of war crimes that prosecutors want to present in court has been destroyed by a rebel leader			1
" there was a commander here at the eastern front in @entity0 named @entity232 ; he ordered all the ( rebel ) fighters to give him all the rape videos they find on @entity8 soldiers ' cell phones			1
i heard that he used to destroy every rape video he got , " @entity90 said			2
asked why potential evidence of war crimes being carried out by @entity108 forces would be destroyed by rebel forces , he cited the heavy stigma that @entity1 culture attaches to the victims of such crimes			1
" aside from being a heinous crime , rape is perceived here in our culture as damaging not only for the girl , but also the whole family , " he said			0
in fact , he added , rape is such a taboo here that some victims ' families would rather erase potential evidence than risk living with the shame			1
in @entity263 , secretary of state @entity262 said the @entity264 was " deeply concerned " over the reports of wide - scale rape in @entity1			0
" a thorough investigation of this matter is needed to bring perpetrators to justice , " she said in a statement			0
" @entity8 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the @entity264 condemns this in the strongest possible terms			0
" @entity2 's @entity283 contributed to this story .			1
