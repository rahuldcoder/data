@entity1 , @entity0 -- the phenomenon is back			2
you may not have recognized him when he came on as a substitute for @entity7 in a @entity9 match , though			1
after all , he 's a few kilos heavier than the @entity10 we grew to know and love in the last decade			1
comeback @entity13 : @entity10 is playing competitive football again -- but will he reach his former glory ? however , at 32 years of age , @entity10 is attempting another comeback			1
will it be a successful one ? as far as i am concerned , it wo n't			1
debate : do you think @entity10 can return to his former glory ? tell us in the @entity25 box below			1
i have had the privilege of interviewing @entity10 various times , and spent some one - on - one time with him in @entity29 and @entity30			1
he 's a great guy , friendly , humble and fun - loving			2
however , that last personality trait has contributed to a turbulent career and lifestyle			0
wherever he has gone , the striker has always made his mark , on and off the field			0
while he was helping @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 win a multitude of titles , he also found himself in the headlines a multitude of times for all the wrong reasons			0
it 's true that @entity10 has always been unfortunate with injuries - he has undergone three major knee operations			1
however , his love for a night out and for a playboy lifestyle may have also contributed to the breakdown of his body			0
in my opinion , this is the reason he will struggle to stay fit and motivated for @entity7 this season			2
there are too many temptations for him in @entity41 , and i do n't see him being able to resist all of them			0
furthermore , he has won practically everything there is to win in the world of football , with the exception of the @entity67			0
so it would be fair to say that he 's not going to bend over backwards to make sure his new team wins some silverware this season			0
he will score the odd goal and make the odd highlight , but i do n't expect his latest comeback to be a success .			0

@entity13 @entity10 is back playing competitive football for @entity7
the 32 - year - old has been out for 13 *months* after needing knee surgery
