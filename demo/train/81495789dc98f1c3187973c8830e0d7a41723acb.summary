editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor at @entity3 , where he heads the @entity4 in @entity5			1
he is the author of a new book , " @entity10 and the @entity11 " and an award - winning filmmaker , with 10 documentaries on science broadcast on @entity9			1
@entity2 says @entity10 's bad gamble shows financial regulation has always been needed			1
( @entity16 ) -- from winter to spring 1720 , @entity17 , @entity18 , was delirious , entranced , rolling in money			0
it seemed as if riches were so easily gained that only fools would not buy into that brand new engine of wealth , the stock exchange , and especially into shares of the enterprise leading the boom , a banking concern called the @entity30			1
as spring turned into summer , no one , it seemed , could deny the obvious , not even the most rational of men			0
so , in june and again in july , sir @entity10 -- the inventor of calculus ( the branch of mathematics that describes change over time , which is to say , an awful lot of what matters in both science and life ) ; the man who framed the laws of motion and set physics on its modern trajectory ; a pioneering chemist , an inventor ( virtually all present - day telescopes derive from his design ) , a religious historian -- and even a financial thinker -- put a sizable chunk of his personal fortune into shares of the @entity30			1
the bubble burst that september			2
@entity10 lost 90 percent of his stake -- a substantial fraction of his total worth			1
in that loss can be found the key to the debate we are having right now in the wake of the @entity68 administration 's move to re-regulate @entity70 financial markets			2
arguments over the supervision of financial transactions occur in the wake of every bubble			2
opponents of such regulation always return to the same simple claim			2
they say that investors are grown - ups , capable of making the best assessments of their own interests and acting accordingly			2
markets are thus no more than self - correcting mechanisms for connecting such rational actors , and any attempt to impose rules on their interaction will only render them less efficient			0
those in favor say that all this is nonsense , that in the real world , markets are not populated by equally well - informed people analyzing their own circumstances and acting accordingly -- and that every financial collapse thus takes down both those who should have known better and those who could n't have hoped to			2
hence , they say , an active enforcer needs to provide a level playing field and to deter actual fraud			0
painfully recent experience suggests that 's true enough -- but @entity10 's case suggests a deeper necessity at the heart of the case for proactive regulation			1
what happened to him , or rather , how he acted , reveals a fundamental truth of economic and emotional life : at the point of crisis , when clear thought and a cool head matter most , no one is in fact a rational actor -- not even the greatest scientific mind of his or any other age			0
so what brought @entity10 low ? desire , perhaps envy , or , in other words , human nature			1
@entity10 had been an active trader in the new stock market for years before the bubble year of 1720			1
he made his first investment in the @entity30 issue early , in 1713 , and held it for several years , marking a modest paper profit			1
he held on through early 1720 , as the company pursued a new and increasingly risky banking deal -- and as insiders began to talk up the ( as it turned out , fictitious ) trading profits the company expected from another venture			0
that got the desired result , a sudden leap in stock prices			0
starting at £ 128 in january , the price for @entity30 securities rose to £ 175 in february and then £ 330 in march			1
@entity10 kept his head -- at first			1
he sold in april , content with his ( quite spectacular ) gains to date			0
but then , between april and june , share prices tripled , reaching over £ 1,000 ... which is precisely when he could stand it no longer			0
having " lost " two thirds of his potential gain , @entity10 bought again at the very top , and bought more after a slight decline in july			1
if that sounds familiar , it should , at least to buyers of @entity155 in 2000 , just before the internet bubble burst -- or , for that matter , to those who picked up @entity159 shares in winter 2008			0
the @entity30 stock price held up through august 1720 , and then in september , the gap between the possible income from all the purchased debt and the returns promised to investors became too obvious to ignore			1
the bubble burst , and @entity30 share prices collapsed to roughly their pre-bubble level			1
@entity10 's losses totaled as much as £ 20,000 , between $ 4 million and $ 5 million in 21st century terms			1
the catastrophe did not sink him ; he had made other , more cautious investments , including a significant stake in the @entity174 , and when he died in 1727 , his estate was valued at £ 30,000 pounds			0
but it was a terrific blow , even so			0
here 's why this story matters now			0
of all people , @entity10 should have known better			2
he had , after all , invented the mathematics that could expose the impossibility of the @entity30 's promise of returns to be paid to an everlasting stream of new investors			1
and yet , even he could not resist the prospect of infinite returns on his money			0
hence , the obligation to regulate			0
there is plenty of recent academic research that confirms that bubbles -- including the ones we 've just endured -- are not unique disasters , but the predictable consequences of human behavior in the context of implausible rewards			0
what @entity10 's experience tells us is that this has been true since the beginning of modern markets -- and that mere intelligence , even genius , does n't help			1
after the disaster , he could not bear to hear the phrase " @entity30 " mentioned in his presence			2
but just once he admitted that while he knew how to predict the motions of the cosmos , " he could not calculate the madness of the people			0
" we still ca n't			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity10 was a mathematical , scientific genius
he says @entity10 got *swept* up in the @entity30 financial mania
he says he lost a big part of his fortune when the @entity30 burst
@entity2 : financial regulation *crucial* to *protect* investors
