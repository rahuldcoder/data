after pleading guilty to a judge tuesday on a felony tax evasion charge , @entity1 rep. @entity0 , a @entity2 , pledged to reporters he would also stay in @entity6			1
@entity0 pled guilty in court to one count of tax evasion and was set to submit to a " statement of facts " that admits to all the conduct alleged in the 20 - count federal indictment			1
a statement from federal prosecutors in @entity1 released on tuesday after @entity0 's court appearance noted that in addition to the tax evasion plea , @entity0 also publicly admitted to hiring undocumented workers , lying under oath while serving in @entity6 , obstructing federal and state officials , and cheating employees out of employment insurance claims			1
@entity26 assistant director - in - @entity27 stated , " the public expects their elected officials at all levels of government to behave honorably , or at a minimum , lawfully			0
as his guilty plea demonstrates , @entity0 put self - interest above public service			1
" @entity0 apologized for his actions and took responsibility , but said the unpaid taxes from a @entity1 restaurant he once owned were all a big mistake			1
" as long as i 'm able to serve i 'm going to serve , " @entity0 said			1
reelected in november , he was is set to be sworn in to a new term in january			0
prosecutors asked a judge to sentence @entity0 on june 8th to 24 to 36 months of jail time			1
his defense team suggested 12 - 18 months			2
can a congressman serve from behind bars ? if recent history is any guide it 's unlikely that @entity0 will serve out his third term that starts in january even though there is nothing in the @entity55 or @entity56 against felons serving in @entity6			1
there is n't much historical precedent for it either , although one congressman in the 1990s , @entity2 @entity61 , shuffled around @entity62 wearing an ankle bracelet after he was convicted of 10 misdemeanors			2
@entity0 's felony plea is a more serious matter			1
while @entity0 said tuesday he has talked to @entity56 leadership about his situation , he has not yet spoken with @entity56 speaker @entity69 and @entity69 has not publicly weighed in on whether @entity0 should step down			1
but @entity69 has made it clear during his time in leadership that he has little patience for those members admitting to any wrongdoing			0
" we wo n't have any announcements until the speaker discusses the matter with mr. @entity0 , " said @entity69 's spokesman @entity75			1
calls for @entity0 to resign are sure to mount and @entity2 leaders would prefer not to deal with questions about a felon remaining in the @entity2 conference when they open up the new session in 2015			1
in previous cases where @entity56 @entity2 admitted to ethical lapses -- criminal or personal -- @entity69 has worked privately to encourage scandal plagued members to step aside on their own			0
former @entity92 @entity2 rep. @entity91 , who pled guilty to cocaine possession last year , initially sought treatment for drug addiction , but resigned two months later			1
when half naked pictures surfaced online of rep. @entity98 of @entity1 soliciting an encounter with a woman on @entity101 he quickly stepped down			1
@entity103 @entity2 @entity102 resigned his seat one day after admitting he had an affair with an aide			0
@entity108 @entity107 called tuesday on @entity69 " to insist that congressman @entity0 resign immediately			1
" @entity109 were frustrated they were unable to defeat @entity0 in november 's midterm election , even with the 20 - count federal indictment hanging over him			2
he also grabbed national headlines last january for threatening to toss a reporter over a balcony on @entity62 after being asked about the allegations			0
if @entity0 does eventually decide to resign , @entity109 have a good chance to pick up that seat in a special election			2
a spokesman for the @entity56 @entity109 ' campaign arm is already accusing @entity69 of covering up for @entity0			2
" after speaker @entity69 abetted @entity0 's lies to voters about his guilt in this past election , he owes it to the constituents and the @entity6 to make sure @entity0 does n't serve in this next @entity6 , " @entity127 , spokesman for the @entity128			1
but a senior @entity56 @entity2 leadership aide points out that @entity107 has not forced out those @entity109 who faced ethics investigations			0
" after standing behind @entity132			0
@entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , and many others , rep. @entity107 has zero credibility of these issues , " the aide told @entity134			0
@entity135 's trial drug out on @entity62 and for a time pitted @entity56 leaders from both parties against the @entity145 , which wanted to raid his office after they found $ 100,000 found in his home freezer			0
it took some time before @entity107 and @entity109 stripped @entity135 of his powerful post on the tax writing committee			2
he ultimately lost a bid for reelection and is serving a 13 - year sentence for bribery			0
while @entity137 and @entity136 faced ethics inquiries , neither was indicted for criminal wrongdoing			0
@entity136 was censured by his colleagues in the @entity56 for ethics violations , including failing to pay taxes , but continues to serve in @entity6			2
@entity137 , who was a top @entity107 soldier , died in 2010 while still in office			0
if @entity0 wants to remain in @entity6 he 'll likely face some type of punishment handed down from the @entity165 , a process that could drag out for months			1
the panel deferred its review at the request of the @entity145 , and under its rules will have to vote to renew its investigation when the next session begins in january			0
the committee declined to comment to @entity134 on the @entity0 case			2
@entity0 has already given up his seat on the @entity176 , but depending on his sentence he could be forced under @entity56 ethics rules to also refrain from voting on the @entity56 floor			2
if the ethics committee votes that @entity182 's actions broke @entity56 rules he could face punishments ranging from reprimand - the mildest public condemnation - to censure or expulsion			0
the last time the @entity56 voted to expel a member was in 2002 , after @entity128 rep @entity189 was convicted of bribery and tax evasion charges			1
the @entity56 has only expelled five members in its entire history			0
three of those were during the @entity197 era for disloyalty			0
another , rep. @entity199 of @entity200 was expelled in 1980 after a bribery conviction .			0

@entity1 rep. @entity0 pled guilty to tax evasion but said he would remain in @entity6
prosecutors asked a judge to give the *lawmaker* between 24 and *30* months of jail time
there is no rule against felons serving in @entity6 , but little precedent for it either
