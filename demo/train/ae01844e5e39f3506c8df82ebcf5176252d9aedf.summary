calls mounted thursday for a criminal investigation into sometimes fatal delays in care at @entity4 hospitals amid revelations that patient wait times were tied to employee bonuses in at least one hospital			1
the demands by lawmakers and veterans groups come as president @entity12 appears to be asking @entity4 secretary @entity13 to set the stage for his own departure , perhaps as soon as friday			1
@entity12 is waiting for an internal audit he ordered from @entity13 on the growing scandal before deciding whom to hold accountable , @entity17 spokesman @entity16 told reporters			1
@entity13 's preliminary report is due this week , @entity16 told reporters amid more calls from across the political spectrum for the secretary to step down or be dismissed over problems known for years but apparently never addressed			1
@entity16 stopped short of saying @entity12 is standing by the embattled secretary , pointing instead to the president 's recent statement that @entity13 would likely not be interested in continuing to serve if he believed he let veterans down			1
but that was not enough for a number of lawmakers in @entity35 after wednesday 's release of a preliminary @entity39 inspector general 's report that described a " systemic " practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the @entity4 medical center in @entity44			1
the @entity39 inspector general reported that at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the @entity39 , raising the question of just how many more may have been " forgotten or lost " in the system			0
rep. @entity52 of @entity53 , the head of the @entity54 , is among those taking the outrage one step further , calling for a criminal investigation by the @entity59			2
" i want to know if anybody at the @entity39 doctored papers , engaged in a cover up , withheld care from veterans , " he told @entity61 , adding the demand in the form of a letter was hand delivered thursday to attorney general @entity67 's office			1
" they need to be investigated they need to be prosecuted			0
they need to be fired			0
" @entity76 rep. @entity76 of @entity77 , chairman of the @entity78 , made a similar demand of the @entity59			1
" i think the facts are too many now for them to look the other way , " he said			0
the @entity83 @entity59 is reviewing the @entity39 inspector general 's report but has not formally opened an investigation , @entity82 , an agency spokesman , has told @entity61			1
the @entity39 is under fire over allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities			0
the controversy , as @entity61 first reported , involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases			0
@entity61 has reported that in @entity44 , the @entity39 used fraudulent record - keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans , some of whom died in the process			0
the @entity39 's troubled history the @entity39 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care			2
the @entity39 's acting inspector general , @entity105 , told a @entity107 committee in recent weeks that his investigation so far had found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in @entity44			1
but he added that there was no evidence excessive waiting was the reason			0
among the findings at the @entity39 , investigators determined that one consequence of manipulating appointments for the veterans was understating patient wait times , a factor considered in @entity39 employee bonuses and raises , the report said			0
@entity76 believes the actions may be in part about money for " va bureaucrats			0
" " why else would somebody work so hard to manipulate the lists ? " @entity76 said			0
the issue of patient wait times is not an overall performance factor ordered by the @entity39 , dr. @entity135 , the @entity39 's assistant deputy undersecretary for clinical operations , told @entity76 's committee			2
the factors tied to bonuses and raises are decided by each @entity39 network , @entity135 said			0
the @entity39 inspector general 's report did not offer any further details about financial incentives			2
@entity16 repeated thursday that @entity12 found the report deeply troubling , and a @entity17 official speaking on the condition of anonymity told @entity61 that @entity13 was on " thin ice " with the president			1
@entity13 finds himself in a firestorm in an opinion piece published thursday in @entity154 , @entity13 wrote that he found the report " reprehensible " and that he 's " not waiting to set things straight			1
" " i immediately directed the @entity157 ... to contact each of the 1,700 veterans in @entity44 waiting for primary care appointments in order to bring them the care they need and deserve , " @entity13 wrote			2
@entity13 reiterated other steps he 's taken , including putting the leadership at the @entity44 facility on leave may 1 and ordering a " nationwide audit of all other major @entity39 health care facilities to ensure understanding of , and compliance with , our appointment policy			1
" " we are doing all we can to accelerate access to care throughout our system and in communities where veterans reside , " @entity13 wrote			1
" i 've challenged our leadership to ensure we are doing everything possible to schedule veterans for their appointments			0
we , at the @entity4 , are redoubling our efforts , with commitment and compassion , to restore integrity to our processes to earn veterans ' trust			0
" even so , it was n't enough for an increasing number of @entity192 politicians who called for @entity13 to go			0
a number of @entity54 senators -- many of them facing rough re-election battles later this year -- have joined a growing bipartisan chorus urging the secretary to resign or the president to fire him			2
" the inspector general 's preliminary report makes it clear that the systemic problems at the @entity83 @entity4 are so entrenched that they require new leadership to be fixed , " said @entity200 of @entity201 , the first @entity107 @entity202 to call for a change at the top			1
list of senators calling for @entity13 resignation still , others question whether removing @entity13 would address the core problems at the @entity39 or simply serve as a distraction for now			2
" is him resigning going to get us to the bottom of the problem ? is it going to help us find out what 's really going on ? , " asked house speaker @entity219 , the chamber 's top @entity220 , adding that his answer so far was " no. " @entity225 @entity224 also warned against targeting only @entity13 , telling reporters that " we have to be careful about thinking that just because you remove the top person , means that you 've changed the systemic problem that existed in the organization 10 years before @entity13 , or five years at least before @entity13 became the secretary			1
" @entity224 also joined the push for a criminal investigation of the @entity39 problems , saying " certainly what was done was dishonest			2
