-- it 's safe to say that @entity2 has returned to television			1
the former " x-files " star is involved in three tv series , beginning with a lead role in " @entity6 , " a psychological crime thriller that debuted to rave reviews on may 13 in @entity9			1
the show hits the @entity13 on may 28 when it 'll be available for streaming via @entity16			2
in " @entity6 , " @entity17 plays a detective who 's pulled into a serial killer case with a unique twist to the genre : the audience knows the culprit from the beginning			1
but her on - screen exploration of killers does n't stop there			2
recently , she 's been seen on @entity29 's " @entity28 , " playing @entity31 's psychiatrist			1
later this summer , she 'll start work on a new @entity29 show called " crisis , " which got a series pick - up earlier this month			0
@entity0 spoke with @entity17 recently from @entity36 about her new tv series , the groundbreaking nature of " @entity39 , " and whether @entity40 will reunite on the big screen			1
@entity0 : in " @entity6 " you play @entity43 , a detective looking for a serial killer			1
she seems like a very serious person			0
is this one of your more serious roles ? @entity2 : i do n't know about that			1
i 've played a lot of serious women			1
i seem to be the go - to woman for seriousness , but as you will see , she 's not all serious			1
there is some lightness in there and some different flavors of personality , i promise			0
@entity0 : the show tells the story in a unique way in the sense that the audience knows who the killer is from the onset			0
what 's interesting for you about the way the story is told ? @entity17 : first of all , that has n't really been done before which is always nice to jump into something that has a bit of uniqueness in this day and age of many , many shows about serial killers			1
the story lines themselves are very intricately woven and individually complex			0
the fact that you got a serial killer who is attractive , who is a good father and who is also a grief counselor on the side while he 's stalking women and doing unthinkable things ... is really eerie			1
the fact that he 's so recognizable as someone we might meet in a bar ... there 's so many different layers in this story			2
it 's a cross section of human life and death , and that 's something in this that works on a much deeper level than just a simple tale of a serial killer hunted by a detective			1
@entity0 : when working on a show that deals with a serial killer , do you ever take your work home with you ? is it depressing to think about murder a lot ? @entity17 : i do n't think about it all the time			1
i think i learned quite early on in my career when i was working on the " x-files " that what 's on the page , stays on the page			2
what 's on the set , stays on the set			2
very often if i 'm working on dark material , i work on it in day time			0
so it does n't effect my night			0
but also , it 's easy ... we talk about compartmentalizing in the series -- i think it 's easy to compartmentalize			2
@entity0 : you also played @entity31 's therapist on @entity29 's " @entity28			1
" is the psychology of killers something you know well at this point in your life ? @entity17 : no , not necessarily i do n't feel like i 'm any particular expert on it even though i 've played many characters who seem to be hunters			1
@entity28 was something that came out the blue			1
@entity144 , the creator , convinced me how fun it would be to come play with them for a little while			0
how cool it would be to be @entity28 's psychiatrist			1
i believed him and said yes			0
i do n't think about these things all together ; i think about them individually			0
@entity0 : in some other alternate universe , could you be a therapist ? @entity17 : i could definitely be a therapist			1
i could not be a forensics pathologist or a detective			2
@entity0 : @entity158 's having this great creative moment right now that everyone is pointing out			2
do you think " x-files " forged a path in certain ways in terms of what the medium could do ? @entity17 : it was @entity169 1			1
it was the first one			0
there 's been a plethora of copy cats and a plethora of different shows that tried to emulate not just the success , but the formula , but also the production values			2
our show was the beginning of huge amounts of money going onto the screen			0
but also , the darkness of it : we were the first show to kind of " turn off the lights " and just light ourselves by flashlight -- and also the subject matter			0
the dark subject matter , the paranormal subject matter , the science - fiction , the duo , the intelligent woman on tv ... they were kinda no. 1 with all that			0
@entity0 : you do play a lot of smart people			0
] i do play so many people that are so much smarter than i am			0
if only i could contain the information that they spout in my practical life , that would be very good			0
@entity0 : you have another series due out later this year on @entity29 called " crisis			0
" what 's your character like on that ? @entity17 : it seems like that 's going to be mid-season			1
the story as a whole is that there 's a high school of elite children in @entity224 , including the son of the president , and they 're on their way to @entity36 for a school trip and their bus gets hijacked			2
i play a mother of one of the kids who is the son of a ceo of a multinational [ corporation ]			0
the story is about what these high - powered people will do to get back the things they care most about , which is their kids			0
@entity0 : is there talk about another " x-files " movie ? @entity17 : yep , yep			1
it has to be written			0
at the point that it 's written , if it 's good , @entity251 and i have always said we 'll be involved			2
so we 'll see .			0
