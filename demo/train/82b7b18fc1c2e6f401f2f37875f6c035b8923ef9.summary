@entity0 -- three @entity3 face criminal charges after the alleged mastermind of one of the most notorious crimes against @entity8 in @entity9 accused them of punching him after his capture , the military said wednesday			1
@entity12 -- thought to be behind the slayings and mutilation of four @entity8 contractors in @entity16 in 2004 and captured in summer -- made the accusations against the three servicemen , said lt. col. @entity19 , a spokeswoman for @entity20			1
a civilian lawyer for one of three seals said his client and the other seals declined a nonjudicial resolution to the case , a step sometimes called a " captain 's mast			2
" the servicemen say they did not harm the detainee in any way and they want their names cleared in a court - martial so they can continue their careers in the @entity35 , said the attorney , @entity36			0
because the charges against petty officer 2nd class @entity38 , petty officer @entity40 and petty officer @entity41 are the military equivalent of misdemeanors , they will go before a special court - martial , which is for less serious offenses than those heard in a general court - martial			0
if found guilty , they could be sentenced to a maximum of a year in a military prison , demotion to the lowest @entity35 rank , a cut in pay and a bad conduct discharge			0
but if found innocent of all charges , they would be able to continue their careers with no record of the case in their personnel files			0
the three seals are with their unit in @entity63 , @entity64			0
they will make an initial appearance before a military judge on december 7			0
the court - martial is scheduled to begin in january			0
the attorney said he expects the @entity3 will not waive their constitutional right to confront the accuser in court , which could cause a logistical challenge			2
@entity12 is believed to be in a @entity8 military detention center overseas , and it is unclear if the military would want him brought to the @entity8 for the court - martial			1
the four contractors , one of whom was a former @entity3 , were working for the @entity80 company when they were attacked in @entity16 in 2004			1
after they were killed with hand grenades and rifles , their bodies were set on fire and dragged through the streets			1
the bodies of two of them were hung from a bridge in @entity16 , an image that was broadcast around the world			2
four days after the attack , the @entity8 @entity92 launched a major offensive inside @entity16 , in part to help find the killers .			1
