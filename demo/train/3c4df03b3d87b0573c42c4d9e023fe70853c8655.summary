@entity0 -- president @entity2 will join what is perhaps @entity5 's most exclusive club , peppered with names such as @entity0 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , when he delivers his second inaugural address on monday			1
by the numbers : presidential inaugurations sixteen of his 43 predecessors , including five of the nation 's first seven presidents , gave more than one inauguration speech , topped by the unprecedented four by @entity9			1
while inaugurations celebrate @entity5 democracy through the peaceful transition or extension of power at a ceremony full of pageantry and color , a second inaugural address tends to feel like many second weddings -- important , for sure , but lacking some of the nervous anticipation of the first one			1
that could be especially true for @entity2 , whose historic ascendancy to the @entity35 four years ago as the nation 's first @entity32 - @entity5 president defined a new political era			0
" on this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord , " he told a frigid crowd estimated at a record 1.8 million people that stretched the length of the @entity41 on january 20 , 2009			0
much of @entity0 rejoiced that day and night , with 10 official inaugural balls and scores of unofficial ones epitomizing the grandeur of the moment			1
the great reset : will @entity2 's second inauguration let @entity5 turn the page ? now @entity2 is a weathered incumbent			0
his hair is graying at age 51 from a first term of tribulations , including an inherited recession , the end of one war and the winding down of another , and constant political brinksmanship with @entity66 over budgets and spending			0
his declaration at his first inauguration of an end to " the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics " proved unfounded			0
@entity79 opponents threaten default and government shutdown over upcoming debt ceiling and funding deadlines			0
@entity2 also faces a political showdown over his gun control proposals -- one of @entity0 's most intractable issues -- in the wake of last month 's school massacre that killed 20 first - graders in @entity91 , @entity92			1
@entity35 @entity79 discussing short - term increase in debt ceiling @entity2 - backed gun bills considered a long shot in @entity66 whether he will explicitly cite such challenges in his second inaugural address was unclear			1
asked about @entity2 's preparations , @entity35 spokesman @entity98 on thursday would only offer that the president was " very appreciative of the fact that the @entity5 people have given him this opportunity to deliver a second inaugural address			1
" " he takes very seriously speeches of this kind , and he 's very engaged in the process , " @entity98 added , noting that @entity2 wrote initial drafts of speeches in longhand on yellow pads			2
" i 've seen some yellow pads of late with writing			0
" history provides little guidance on what to expect monday			1
while themes of unifying the country and seeking @entity122 's blessings are common to most inaugural addresses , second efforts have come in varied lengths and styles			2
@entity126 concluded his second inaugural address with a claim of vindication			1
he noted that his role as @entity132 military leader and president subjected him to " abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history , which today i feel that i can afford to disregard in view of your verdict " of re-election			2
some two - term presidents focused their second speeches on particular challenges at hand , such as @entity8 's highly regarded address in the final days of the @entity146 in 1865 , shortly before his assassination			1
@entity148 to attend @entity2 's inauguration " with malice toward none ; with charity for all ; with firmness in the right as @entity122 gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in ; to bind up the nation 's wounds ; to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just , and lasting peace , among ourselves , and with all nations , " @entity8 said to conclude the speech of 697 words , a fraction of the 3,610 in his first inaugural address			1
he had acknowledged that difference to begin his remarks , saying : " at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first			2
" share your inauguration photos on @entity183 in a passage that would seem to fit @entity2 also , @entity8 noted that " at the expiration of four years , during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation , little that is new could be presented			2
" three score and 12 years earlier , @entity195 set the standard for a shortened second inaugural speech			0
he limited it to 135 words , compared with the 1,428 he spoke when he became the nation 's first president			0
@entity9 's fourth and final inaugural address , in 1945 , also was his shortest , historian @entity204 told @entity1			1
dual inauguration ceremonies honor tradition and law " it was a five - minute speech , and he needed to fortify himself with whiskey in order to get through the pain that he was feeling " from the heart failure that would kill him months later , she said , noting @entity9 also canceled the traditional inaugural parade that year			1
" in the middle of a war , why are we going to have a parade , who 's going to parade ? " she said @entity9 had asked			2
" normally you have military people parading , and they were in the war itself			0
" more recently , the trend has been to talk longer the second time around , as demonstrated by both @entity231 and @entity232			1
while only @entity2 knows if he will scale back his speech from the 2,395 words of four years ago , other inaugural staples are being reduced this time			2
there will be two official inaugural balls , eight fewer than in 2009			0
because january 20 -- @entity238 -- falls on a sunday this year , the official swearing - in will occur at the @entity35 , attended by the president 's family			0
monday will be the public ceremony , with @entity2 to be sworn in again by @entity244 chief justice @entity243 at the @entity245 , followed by the president 's speech and then the parade up @entity249 to the @entity35			0
a crowd of 800,000 , smaller than last time , is expected			0
@entity251 to perform for inauguration @entity2 taps @entity254 poet for inauguration chief justice to get another go at oath inauguration brings different kind of gridlock @entity1 's @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
