@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity1 court this week granted an injunction that blocks internet giant @entity5 from " suggesting " searches that lead to certain sites that have been deemed anti-semitic , and removes the sites from the search engine 's index			1
the injunction , filed by @entity12 , an umbrella organization of @entity1 's @entity14 community , also prohibits @entity5 from advertising on the stated websites			1
the injunction names 76 sites that the organization considers " highly discriminatory			1
" @entity5 's suggested searches are a @entity5 algorithm that offers search terms similar to the one the user appears to be typing in			0
" the common denominator on these sites is the incitement of hate and the call to violence , " @entity12 said in a statement			0
" in none of these cases are there discussions or criticisms from the academic , technological , political or philosophical perspectives			0
" @entity5 representatives in the @entity38 and @entity1 did not immediately respond to calls for comment			0
@entity1 has the largest @entity14 population in @entity42			1
the jewish community there numbers more than 250,000 , with the majority residing in the capital , @entity0			1
the ruling notes that restrictions on freedom of speech and censorship is illegal under the @entity1 constitution , but also notes that the constitution protects people from discrimination			1
as such , the judge cited previous cases in @entity1 that establish that in some restricted cases , it is permissible to prevent the diffusion of certain publications if they infringe on someone 's personal rights			1
judge @entity65 concluded that " the terms mentioned ( in the lawsuit ) as well as the results obtained through ' suggested searches ' could be described as discriminatory acts and / or at least , incitement and / or encouragement for discrimination			1
" according to @entity12 , the suggested search complaint focused on 13 terms that led to websites that are anti-semitic , some of which deny that the @entity79 took place			1
the group did not disclose the 13 terms in question , nor the names of the websites that were blocked			1
in a statement , the group said that by suggesting these websites , @entity5 is " inducing and directing traffic to sites with offensive and illegal content			1
" in @entity1 , there have been previous cases in which individuals have sued to have certain websites removed from @entity5 's index , citing invasion of privacy , said @entity99 , research director for the @entity100 at @entity101			2
the court actions in @entity1 appear to view @entity5 more as a publisher of information than as an intermediary , he said			0
" it seems to reflect a misunderstanding of how the internet works and how search engines work , " he said			2
@entity110 , director of the @entity111 at the @entity113 - based @entity112 , said the @entity1 court 's move was part of a " problematic trend " on the part of many governments			2
" at the end of the day , enlisting companies to become greater gatekeepers on content online really does shrink the range of speech that we can access			0
... it 's dangerous to try to shut down speech , because you do n't get that kind of robust public debate about what should or should not be acceptable in a democratic society , " she said			0
while restrictions on the internet are usually associated with countries such as @entity139 or @entity140 , it is not uncommon for other nations to try to impose some limits on it			2
@entity145 , for example , asked @entity5 to remove @entity147 videos that showed the @entity145 king , @entity148 , with feet near his head			0
in @entity145 culture , it 's considered extremely offensive for anyone 's feet to be near someone 's head			0
a national law bans such representations , and @entity5 agreed not to show such videos within @entity145 , although they are still available elsewhere in the world			0
@entity159 bans neo-nazi content , and @entity5 has agreed to remove such sites from its @entity163 search engine in that country			0
@entity165 , meanwhile , blocks @entity147 because the company refused to take down all potentially offensive videos about @entity168 , the @entity165 political hero			0
" it 's a slippery slope			1
i do n't think that the people of @entity1 are harmed by the inability to see anti-semitic content , but i think that the best answer is counter-speech , " said @entity170 , a researcher at the @entity171			2
he noted that @entity5 , faced with anti-semitic search results in the @entity38 , responded by posting an ad with a link to a statement that includes a link to information from the @entity182			1
" if you recently used @entity5 to search for the word ' @entity14 , ' you may have seen results that were very disturbing			1
we assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by @entity5 , " @entity5 's policy statement says			2
it goes on to note that citizens and organizations have urged the company to remove links or adjust search results			2
" although @entity5 reserves the right to address such requests individually , @entity5 views the comprehensiveness of our search results as an extremely important priority , " the statement says			0
" accordingly , we do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it			0
" @entity2 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
