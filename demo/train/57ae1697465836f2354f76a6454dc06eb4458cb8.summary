-- a sheriff 's deputy in central @entity3 was shot friday afternoon by a suspected drug trafficker , authorities said			1
the @entity6 deputy , who was not immediately identified , contacted authorities after being wounded in the desert , saying he had been shot by an illegal immigrant with an @entity10 , said lt. @entity11 , a sheriff 's spokeswoman			1
the deputy radioed that he had encountered five men , some wielding long guns and handguns , and said they were carrying a large amount of marijuana			1
at one point the deputy lost radio contact with authorities , leading to a search by foot and by air for him and the shooter , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity26			1
video from the scene shows that the deputy was located while sitting in desert brush , surrounded by cactus			2
he was able to walk to a helicopter that airlifted him to a hospital			0
a spokeswoman at @entity35 confirmed that the deputy was being treated there friday evening			2
he was in good condition with stable vital signs , conscious and comfortable , she said			0
@entity26 : @entity38 stopped five suspects the deputy was shot in the left abdomen and suffered a superficial wound , law enforcement sources said			2
the search for the shooter continued into the evening			0
the shooting comes amid a national debate over @entity3 's tough new immigration law , which allows police to demand proof of legal residency			0
@entity3 lawmakers say the law is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with @entity56 , allowing more than 450,000 illegal immigrants to move into the state			1
@entity59 : @entity38 expected to survive @entity6 is between @entity60 and @entity61 and has been described as a key transit point for illegal immigrants and drug traffickers			1
sheriff @entity65 said an estimated 80 percent of illegal immigrants pass through his county along the way to other locations			1
earlier this week , a @entity0 crew spent 12 hours on patrol with @entity6 deputies			1
in that time , the deputies captured more than 50 suspected illegal immigrants and about 2,000 pounds of marijuana			1
deputies in the department routinely patrol for illegal immigrants and smugglers , and it is not uncommon for them to be in the field alone , officials said			1
it was not immediately clear what led the deputy to engage with the shooter friday			2
the shooting is sure to heat up the debate around the new @entity3 law			0
critics say the law is unconstitutional and will lead to racial profiling , which is illegal			2
but @entity92 @entity3 gov. @entity92 and others who support the law say it does not involve profiling or other illegal acts and will cut down on illegal immigration			0
" frankly this is just a very horrible story , but we should not generalize , " @entity98 , former chief of the @entity99 , told @entity0 's @entity100 when news of friday 's shooting broke			0
" we should focus on the criminality of the drug traffickers ... not scapegoat undocumented immigrants who do not pose any threat to society			1
" @entity92 on friday signed a bill that makes changes to the immigration law , saying the changes will ease concerns about racial profiling			0
the law , which will go into effect in 90 days , has already drawn at least two lawsuits and condemnation from the @entity56 government and other @entity122 nations			0
prominent entertainers , including @entity124 and @entity125 , also have spoken against the law			0
some critics are calling for a boycott of @entity3 , urging tourists to stay away and that no one do business with companies in the state			0
