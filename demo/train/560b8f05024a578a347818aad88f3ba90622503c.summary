@entity0 -- torrential rains moved walls of rock and mud friday in @entity6 , burying homes in one neighborhood , closing a coastal highway and prompting evacuations of foothill communities imperiled by landslides			1
the damage marked the second day of a fierce storm slamming the @entity15 that , in @entity6 , served to trade one natural disaster for another , namely the state 's record drought of the past three years			1
at a minimum , the biggest storm in years slaked the dry earth , but it is coming at a high price for many people			1
mudslides swarmed or threatened homes near recent hillside fires			1
ten homes in the @entity31 area were damaged and red - tagged as uninhabitable after a mudslide crashed into a subdivision and piled rocks almost as high as roof lines , authorities said			1
an elderly couple needed to be rescued after they stayed in their home despite a voluntary evacuation order and suddenly found water and earth plowing into their bedroom , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity44			1
" it just came pouring in , so i told my wife just stay in bed , " the man told the affiliate after he was rescued			1
" i could just feel the mud ... there must be 3 or 4 feet of mud in there			2
" firefighters carried the couple to safety , uninjured			1
" i 'm ok , " the man told the station			2
later friday , @entity58 and @entity60 's son called his parents ' survival of the landslide as " pretty darn amazing			2
" " it gets you by surprise , " son @entity64 said			2
@entity69 water recovery and rescue firefighters in @entity72 conducted a rescue in the swift waters of a flood channel in @entity76			1

inundating rain the rain intensity in @entity120 on thursday was reminiscent of a tropical shower in some places , a biblical deluge in others			0
nearly 2.5 inches doused the @entity121 , but north of there , just beyond wine country , 14.6 inches washed down on the @entity152			0
the rain will put a dent in a historic three - year drought that has sapped reservoirs , threatening farmers and driving up food prices			0

an ' atmospheric river ' much of the moisture , at least along the @entity6 coast , comes from an " atmospheric river , " a band of heavily moist air that split off from a larger such band in the tropics			0

such atmospheric river drenchings in @entity6 are rare but also normal and necessary , the @entity177 said			0
they 're how the parched state gets up to 50 % of its annual rainfall			0
