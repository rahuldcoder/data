-- @entity1 is used to letting his famous nephew do the talking with his tennis racket -- and it sounds like it should stay that way			2
the uncle and long - time coach to 14 - time grand slam champion @entity8 is in hot water after serving up some controversial comments on @entity13 's new @entity12 captain , @entity11			1
@entity14 , who was announced as successor to @entity16 earlier this week , is the first female to captain @entity13 's men 's team			1
she is the fifth woman to coach a @entity12 side , according to the @entity22			0
but @entity8 thinks appointing the 40 - year - old -- whose highest ranking as a player was 27th -- could pose problems , not least in the locker room			1
" in no way am i sexist , " @entity8 told @entity13 radio station @entity28 on tuesday			2
" you could brand me old - fashioned in seeing problems about having to share a dressing room with a woman , but to go from there to talking about sexism ... would i be ok with peeing in front of a woman ? no way			1
that in any case might be old - fashioned			0
" comfort breaks are n't the only issue , according to @entity8			0
" a woman is just as capable as a man , but men 's and women 's tennis are different sports , " he argued			2
" i know nothing about the hours and training systems for women 's tennis			0
i do n't even know who the best players are			0
i doubt @entity11 knows the ( men 's ) world number 40 ... " @entity8 , 53 , was responding after his initial comments on the subject aired on monday caused a bit of a stir			1
in a interview with on @entity61 , @entity13 's national radio station , @entity8 initially suggested it " might be easier for the captain to be a man , " before addressing the issue of the locker room for the first time			1
" i believe she does n't know the players , at least @entity69 , and there is a logistical difficulty that is difficult to solve , because in the @entity12 a lot of time is spent in locker rooms without much clothing and with a woman it would always be weird			0
" but some players who may play under @entity14 appear unfazed by the prospect			0
" i do n't think the fact she is a woman affects anything , " doubles specialist @entity79 said , @entity13 newspaper @entity80 reported			0
" the players have to accept it , to be united , to play , win and go up to the @entity86 , " the 32 - year - old added			2
" there are several rooms ... it 's not essential that she is there where you 're having a shower			0
it will be a bit different , but i do n't think whether she can or ca n't be there all the time will influence the development of her work			0
" @entity102 's @entity101 , who appointed former women 's world no. 1 @entity103 as his coach in june , was supportive of @entity14 's appointment			1
@entity101 's recent tweet about @entity109 independence might have been controversial but few would have disagreed with his views on the vote of confidence in @entity14 by @entity13 's @entity12 bosses			1
" congrats to @entity11 for becoming first female @entity13 @entity12 captain today ... hopefully first of many ! " @entity101 tweeted			1
@entity13 has dominated the @entity12 in the early 21st century , winning the team tournament five times since 2000 , but has struggled in recent times			2
in september , @entity13 was relegated from the @entity86 for the first time since 1996 after losing 3 - 1 to @entity120			0
the wrist injury that kept @entity8 out of the @entity122 also precluded his involvement in @entity13 's defeat in @entity125 , but the world no. 2 is expected to return to action at next week 's @entity129 in @entity130 .			1

@entity1 *queries* appointment of @entity11 as @entity13 's @entity12 team captain
@entity8 's uncle says *choosing* a woman to captain could cause issues in dressing room
the 53 - year - old also says " a woman just as capable as a man " and that he 's " no sexist "
@entity101 , who is coached by @entity103 , tweets support to @entity14
