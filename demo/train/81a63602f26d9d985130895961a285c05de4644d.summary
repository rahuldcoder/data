-- @entity3 militia fighters killed at least 72 @entity5 men and boys in two attacks in a remote southwestern corner of the strife - torn @entity9 , rights group @entity1 said thursday			1
the attacks in the village of @entity13 , which occurred in february , came to light after the rights group interviewed survivors , mostly women , children and the elderly , who had sought refuge in a nearby village			1
researchers also uncovered another massacre two weeks later in another village , @entity23 , this time of 19 people			1
they were killed by armed fighters from @entity26 , a predominantly @entity5 group , supported by cattle herders , the rights group said in a report			1
according to @entity1 , @entity31 and @entity32 peacekeeping forces are deployed in the larger southwestern towns of @entity34 and @entity35 but do not patrol the road between them where these villages lie			1
the spiraling ethnic violence in the @entity9 has led some observers to fear another genocide like that seen in @entity43 nearly 20 years ago			1
the @entity9 was plunged into chaos last year after @entity26 ousted president @entity45			2
rebels infiltrated the capital in march 2013 , sending @entity45 fleeing to @entity49			0
one of @entity26 's leaders , @entity51 , then seized power , only to step down as president in january after failing to halt the escalating violence			2
@entity55 , the mayor of @entity56 , was recently installed as the country 's interim president , but the situation remains volatile			0
to counter attacks on @entity3 communities by @entity26 groups , vigilante @entity3 groups known as the anti-balaka , which translates to " anti-machete , " have fought back			0
witnesses told @entity1 that anti-balaka fighters were behind the two attacks on @entity5 in @entity13 , one on february 1 and the second four days later			1
one woman described seeing her husband being set upon with machetes as she fled with their 4 - year - old son			0
and the father of 10 - year - old @entity74 told @entity1 that the militia did not spare his son despite his young age			2
" i took my son when the anti-balaka attacked , " he said			0
" as we were running away , he was shot by the anti-balaka			0
he was shot in the right leg , and he fell down , but they finished him off with a machete			0
i had no choice but to run on			0
i had been shot too			0
i later went to see his body , and he had been struck in his head and in the neck			0
" @entity1 called for @entity92 's interim government to investigate the killings and hold those responsible to account			2
it also called for the international community to hasten the authorization and deployment of a @entity99 peacekeeping force in order to protect vulnerable people in remote areas			1
" these horrendous killings show that the @entity31 and @entity32 peacekeeping deployment is not protecting villages from these deadly attacks , " said @entity103 , @entity104 researcher for @entity1			1
" the @entity109 should n't waste another minute in authorizing a @entity99 peacekeeping mission with the troops and capacity to protect the country 's vulnerable people			1
" on tuesday , the @entity115 announced a military operation to help restore stability to the @entity9			2
it will focus on securing the country 's capital , @entity56 , and its airport , " with a view to handing over to a @entity99 peacekeeping operation or to @entity104 partners , " a statement said			1
@entity31 , the former colonial power in the @entity9 , deployed 1,600 personnel there to support @entity32 troops in december after a @entity109 vote authorizing military intervention			2
last year 's coup was the latest in a series since the country gained independence in 1960			0
@entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0
