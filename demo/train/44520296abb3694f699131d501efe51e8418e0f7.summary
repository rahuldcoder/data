to some , the hijab is a symbol of female oppression and @entity6 fundamentalism			0
but to @entity8 , a muslim who moved from @entity11 to @entity12 at age 11 , the headscarf is a symbol of her religious belief in beauty through modesty			1
" modesty is part of our @entity6 faith , " @entity18 wrote in an email			1
" no one should be discriminated ( against ) for following their faith			1
" so @entity18 started @entity26 to build empathy for this perspective and to encourage non-muslims , and @entity30 who do n't normally wear a hijab , to try it out			1
the @entity34 word hijab refers not just to a headscarf but to modest dress and behavior in general			1
" our goal is to foster global religious tolerance and understanding through hijab awareness			2
many women get discriminated ( against ) simply because they choose to wear the hijab , " @entity18 said			1
" hopefully , this event will make people realize that women who wear the hijab are just like anyone else			1
they 're not oppressed or are forced to wear it			1
they just simply want to follow their faith by being modest , just like @entity52 ( mother of @entity54 )			1
" for the first time in its three - year run , sunday 's @entity26 became a trending topic on social media as women supported the effort in events worldwide and shared images tagged # @entity63			1
" covering up should be a free choice ! i may not be @entity30 or religious but i support the beauty a hijab can bring to a woman , " said one woman who shared an image through the @entity26 website			1
the concept of modesty is not unique to @entity6			2
other religions , including @entity75 and @entity76 , embrace the concept			0
still , public expression of hijab can be controversial and often misunderstood -- especially in the @entity80 -- despite being protected by the @entity81 right to free speech and freedom of religion			0
my take : my hijab is my hoodie many hijabis , or wearers of hijabs , are stigmatized for the practice , @entity18 said , speaking from experience			2
after moving with her family to the @entity80 , she says , she was taunted and called names for wearing hijab to school			0
the harassment continued into high school and college and became worse after the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
" i always faced the following question : ' why do n't you ever dress normal ? ' " she said			2
" i constantly lived in fear as i was called names such as @entity105 , terrorist , etc. it was a total nightmare			0
" in summer 2011 , after friends from around the world shared similar stories of harassment , @entity18 began pondering solutions			0
" i kept on thinking how can i help them and myself ? " she said			0
" i thought if i could invite other women ( @entity30 & @entity115 ) to walk in my shoes just for one day , perhaps , things would change			1
" this year , " ambassadors " in 33 countries organized @entity26 events			1
organizers in @entity123 , for example , invited the public to try on hijabs at a mall in @entity127 , @entity128			2
@entity18 , the organizer of that event , made the choice to start covering her head four years ago after a pilgrimage to @entity134 , @entity6 's holiest site			1
born in @entity135 and raised in @entity136 , the 37 - year - old @entity138 employee has practiced @entity6 all her life			0
the spiritual journey moved her to embrace her faith in a deeper way through hijab			2
" i did it because i wanted to do it			0
it 's progress for me as a @entity30 woman , the next step in my faith , " said @entity18 ( no relation to @entity8 )			1
" it 's moving forward religiously			0
if you 're raised in @entity6 , then you want to embrace everything it says			2
for me , personally , that progress was doing the hijab			0
" she became involved in hijab activism in 2014 , when @entity159 's national assembly began hearings on a secular charter to ban overt religious symbols in the public - sector workplace			0
she felt compelled to start speaking up in her community to help others understand that , for people like her , the hijab is a choice , not an imposition			0
" if we keep living in our silos , we will never be able to break down barriers and stereotypes , " she said			0
" social justice is not a spectator sport , so if we do n't work for it , nothing will change			0

@entity26 seeks to raise awareness about modest @entity30 dress
the organizer says many women wear hijabs by choice , not because they 're forced to
the headscarf is a way of expressing modesty , a key tenet of the @entity30 faith
