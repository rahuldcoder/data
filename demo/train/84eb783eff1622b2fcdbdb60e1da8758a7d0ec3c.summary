-- @entity3 's @entity2 drama " the @entity5 " is about to blow its cover			1
after quietly spending its first season in 2013 flying under the radar , this spy series is poised to be exposed as the discriminating tv fan 's favorite addiction			1
on the surface , the ' 80s - set series from @entity12 is pretty straightforward : two @entity15 agents , played by @entity16 and @entity17 , pose as a mild - mannered married couple with two kids in the suburbs of @entity21 during the @entity23 administration			1
no one knows what these two are actually doing when they 're working at their " travel agency , " and that includes their two children , teenager @entity30 ( @entity31 ) and her younger brother , @entity33 ( @entity32 )			0
the potential for plot twists alone would seem reason enough to watch , but what 's kept viewers glued to their sets is the series ' complexity			2
" the @entity5 " has heart - racing suspense , but also high - minded reflections on the politics of love , marriage and loyalty			1
so , after a nine - month hiatus , we 're more than ready to welcome back @entity3 's weekly dose of espionage , ' 80s pop culture and @entity2 killing			1
and with its second season , " the @entity5 " is going to have a tender twist : a focus on love and family amid the thrills and intrigue			1
when last we saw our @entity67 spies - next - door , @entity65 and @entity17 ' @entity64 and @entity68 , they 'd narrowly escaped a trap set by their neighbor , @entity71 agent @entity70 ( @entity70 )			1
the new season picks up with @entity64 and @entity68 , who 've had a rocky relationship to say the least , reuniting at their home with heightened sensitivity for keeping their children safe from their deadly lifestyle			2
there are so many questions to answer : will the @entity68 kids learn the awful truth about their parents ? can @entity68 and @entity64 make their bizarre marriage -- created under the guise of accomplishing a mission and now something more -- work out ? and what about @entity70 , who 's still clueless that his neighbors are the spies he 's been chasing with a passion ? in honor of the return of " the @entity5 , " we give you five reasons to put it on your tv surveillance list : best excuse to " do laundry in the middle of the night " in season one , the laundry room was the perfect cover for @entity64 and @entity68 's @entity15 operation			1
but the @entity68 ' daughter @entity30 is getting older â € ” and savvier			0
she 's starting to notice her mom and dad are spending a little too much time " doing laundry " in the basement			2
if she snoops too much , she might uncover her parents ' secret stash of spy gear			0
oops ! ( how do you think they 'll be able to explain that ? " honey , do you know what a ' license to kill ' is ? " ) more wigs than a @entity121 concert let 's put aside the show 's reputation as a critical standout and focus on its notoriously bad wig collection			1
with this being a show about spies , the ridiculous disguises come in spades			2
it seems like every episode offers a fantastic excuse to trot out a spectacular set of fake teeth , false mustaches and dyed hair			0
there are so many different combinations , @entity17 has even picked a favorite			2
" i 've named him ; he 's called @entity142			0
we actually saw him in the first episode of the first season when he beat up someone who was being rather lascivious with his daughter at a department store , " he told reporters during a recent conference call			0
" he has , like , a mustache and long hair and a little goatee , and he feels very latin to me			0
" dear show runners : please keep ' em coming ! best show with spouses who have an understanding about on - the - job sex it must be hard for @entity68 and @entity64 to fix their marriage while they 're both having sex with their sources			0
or , for that matter , when they 're tying the knot with them			0
( hey , whatever it takes to defend the @entity176 ! ) in season 2 , @entity68 's " marriage " to @entity71 administrative assistant @entity181 ( @entity182 ) is making his life even more complicated			2
" they plant such a beautiful seed of conflict within @entity64 , " @entity17 said			2
" she 's been this stalwart , this hardline , hard - nosed agent for so long , who 's still incredibly loyal to the cause , ( and now ) she has this great enormous struggle within her where she realizes that she has these feelings for @entity68			0
... ( @entity194 ) a device it 's rather fantastic , but it certainly takes its toll on the relationship			0
" best show with multiple 1980s pop culture references is it wrong if we secretly hope that " the @entity5 " does for the ' 80s what " @entity203 " has done for the ' 60s ? from leg - warmers to high - waisted jeans to an ' 80s soundtrack , we love this show 's playpen of anachronisms			1
this season , look for references to a real - life relationship guru , excellent movies on @entity214 and a new @entity216 spy who loves rockers like @entity218 and @entity219			0
@entity220 for the season premiere of a @entity2 drama we do n't think @entity3 's marketing team could have possibly thought up a better coincidence			1
the new season just so happens to kick off while @entity5 - @entity67 tensions have been on the rise			1
@entity0 's own @entity228 had to double - check its calendar the other day while asking , " @entity2 is over			1
right ? " if that 's not enough , here 's a secret sixth reason : the writers have set up a carefully layered examination of human behavior that is teetering on the edge of disaster , not unlike a table of human dominoes			0
when the first one falls , it should be deliciously fun to watch .			0

@entity3 's @entity2 drama " the @entity5 " returns *february* *26*
@entity16 and @entity17 star as undercover @entity67 spies
now in its second season , it will focus more on love and family
