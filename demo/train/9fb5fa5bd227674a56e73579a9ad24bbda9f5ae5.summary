-- when @entity3 takes the podium at the @entity5 wednesday evening his wife , secretary of state @entity1 , will be half a world away -- literally -- meeting with the leaders of the tiny nation of @entity9			1
@entity1 , who has n't missed a @entity5 convention in four decades , is on an 11 - day swing through the @entity12 , visiting a number of counties , including @entity15 and @entity16 , and standing in for president @entity17 at the @entity18 later this week in @entity19			1
@entity17 bowed out because of the election campaign			0
some clinton - watchers see an ulterior motive , concluding that the secretary , who waged a hard - fought campaign against @entity17 for the @entity5 nomination in 2008 , still bears a grudge			1
@entity17 and @entity3 : a solid relationship ? but the two have worked closely since then and , what 's more , there 's a less adversarial explanation for her absence from the convention : legally , she ca n't be there			1
federal law -- the @entity36 of 1939 , amended by @entity37 in 1993 -- specifically prohibits secretaries of state from attending political conventions , and the @entity42 's own ethics guidelines also rule out political activity			2
a senior administration official , speaking on background because the official is not authorized to speak on the record , told @entity0 , " the law carved out the @entity42 as having a unique position in the government in that foreign policy , by its nature , must remain nonpartisan / apolitical			0
" see tonight 's @entity53 " so @entity42 officials -- specifically those who are presidential appointees confirmed by the @entity55 ( i.e. the secretary ) -- are far more restricted than , say , someone who works at the @entity58			0
" when @entity60 was president @entity61 's secretary of state , she did not attend the @entity62			0
now that she 's a private citizen , however , she did take part in last week 's @entity62 , delivering a speech on foreign policy			0
will @entity1 try to tune in from @entity9 to watch her husband 's speech ? her staff is n't saying			1
but if her usual travel schedule applies -- every minute jam - packed with meetings , briefings and news conferences -- she may wait until she gets back home to hear from @entity3 directly how it went			0
@entity0 @entity75 : about those 4.5 million jobs ... are you better off now than you were four years ago ? five things to watch at @entity5 tonight			2

@entity1 will be in @entity9 when @entity3 speaks at the @entity5 convention
some clinton - watchers see an ulterior motive in @entity1 's absence
she and @entity17 fought for the @entity5 nomination four years ago
but there 's a less adversarial reason -- by law , the secretary of state ca n't be there
