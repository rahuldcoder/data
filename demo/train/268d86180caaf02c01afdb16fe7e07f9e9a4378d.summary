@entity0 -- the @entity5 administration 's efforts to help struggling homeowners will aid " responsible " borrowers , not deadbeats or speculators , housing secretary @entity2 said sunday			1
the plan is aimed at " folks who are playing by the rules , " housing secretary @entity2 says			1
president @entity5 announced the plan wednesday , saying it will help up to 9 million people keep their homes in a housing market ravaged by foreclosures			1
but critics , including several leading republicans and some commentators , said the $ 75 billion proposal will unfairly help some people at the expense of others			1
@entity26 spokesman @entity25 acknowledged friday that some people who made " bad decisions " might end up getting help under the proposal			2
but @entity2 , @entity5 's secretary of housing and urban development , told @entity1 's " @entity31 " on sunday that " there are no ' flippers , ' investor - owners or scammers that are eligible for this program			1
" " we 're going check everybody 's income when they come into this program			2
we 're going to make sure that people are paying their bills			1
and more than anything , we 're targeting the folks who are playing by the rules , " @entity2 said			1
the administration 's proposal would make it easier for homeowners to afford their monthly payments either by refinancing the mortgages or having their loans modified			0
and it would vastly broaden the scope of the government rescue by focusing on homeowners who are still current in their payments but at risk of default			0
read more about the plan @entity63 gov. @entity62 , a @entity64 who also has criticized the administration 's stimulus package , called the mortgage plan " a horrible idea			2
" " about 95 percent of folks are playing by the rules and struggling , but still paying their mortgages			1
the idea that somebody down the street gets a different system , i think , is ultimately something that 's going to undermine a whole lot of other folks with regard to paying their mortgage , " @entity62 told " @entity81			2
" in particular , he singled out a provision that would allow judges to modify or reduce the principal of loans for borrowers in bankruptcy -- an idea @entity62 called " incredibly dangerous for the precedent it sets			0
" but @entity2 told @entity92 's " @entity91 " that judges already have that power for second homes or vacation homes			1
" it 's only for people who have one home and are living in it or are in trouble where you ca n't have a modification of that loan in bankruptcy , " he said			1
but he said the administration would limit the plan to existing loans , not future ones , and considered it a " last resort			2
" " there seems to be growing consensus that this is an important part of the solution , " he said			0
about $ 50 billion of the money would come from the $ 700 billion financial industry bailout package , a senior administration official said friday			0
nationalized mortgage giants @entity117 and @entity118 will contribute more than $ 20 billion to the loan modification program , mainly to subsidize interest rates so troubled borrowers ' monthly payments can be lowered to affordable levels			0
but those companies are on shaky financial ground themselves and are expected to report billions in losses in the next week or two			0
to stabilize them , the foreclosure prevention program calls for doubling their lines of credit with the federal government to $ 200 billion each			0
@entity2 said 45 percent of home sales in december were " distressed , " meaning either sellers were facing foreclosure or the homes were already seized by the bank , driving down home prices further in an already - battered market			1
" we 've got to make clear , here , that a foreclosure hurts every @entity142 , " he told @entity1			0
in releasing his proposal wednesday , @entity5 said it would help both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default			0
but it does virtually nothing for the unemployed , who often do n't have enough income to make any reasonable monthly payment affordable			0
and since it relies more heavily on lowering interest rates than on reducing principal , it does little for borrowers concerned their homes will never recoup their value .			0

housing secretary @entity2 : scammers , speculators wo n't be helped
critics have said plan will unfairly help some people at the expense of others
