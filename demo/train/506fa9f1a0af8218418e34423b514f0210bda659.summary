" our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now , " @entity8 said in a statement published tuesday by its official news agency , @entity10			0
@entity1 said it was responding to what it called insults from the " puppet authorities " in the @entity7 , claiming that there had been a rally against @entity1 in @entity19 -- a rally it called a " monstrous criminal act			1
" the renewed menacing rhetoric came a day after @entity1 celebrated the birthday of their country 's founder , @entity24 , who launched the @entity27			2
@entity28 , a spokesman for the @entity29 , said the latest threat from the @entity1 was regrettable			2

also tuesday , a @entity37 helicopter participating in annual joint military exercises in @entity7 made a hard landing in a province that borders @entity1 , the @entity35 military said			1
the drills by @entity7 and @entity35 forces have upset @entity1 , as they have done in previous years			1
@entity8 has suggested that the routine exercises , which are scheduled to continue until the end of the month , are tantamount to a declaration of war			0
the 21 personnel on board the @entity50 helicopter , which was making routine flights as part of the exercises when it came down , were taken to a hospital at the @entity35 ' @entity55 in @entity7 , the military said in a statement			1

" the five crew members of the helicopter are from the 31st @entity67 , stationed in @entity68 , @entity69			0
conditions for talks a @entity1 foreign ministry spokesman dismissed @entity35 calls for talks as " nothing but a crafty ploy " to deflect blame for the rising tensions , in a statement published by @entity10 tuesday			1
the @entity35 urging dialogue is like a robber " calling for a negotiated solution while brandishing his gun , " it said			2
on monday , @entity35 secretary of state @entity86 had urged the regime in @entity8 to ditch its nuclear program and put a lid on its fiery rhetoric if it wants to hold talks			1
" the @entity35 has made clear many times what the conditions are for our entering talks , and they have n't changed , " @entity86 said in an interview with @entity0 's @entity93 in @entity94			1
" the conditions have to be met where the @entity1 has to move towards denuclearization , indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats , stop the testing and indicate it 's actually prepared to negotiate , " he said			2

his visit followed weeks of dramatic threats by @entity114 's regime , including that of a nuclear strike on the @entity35 and @entity7			1
the @entity117 announced monday that @entity7 president @entity118 will visit president @entity119 in @entity120 on may 7			2
" president @entity118 's visit underscores the importance of the @entity35 - @entity7 ( @entity7 ) alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the @entity129 and in the @entity130 , and of the central role of alliances in the president 's @entity130 rebalancing effort , " the @entity117 said in a statement			1
there is uncertainty about how advanced the @entity1 's nuclear weapons program is , but @entity86 reiterated monday the @entity35 government view that @entity8 does n't yet have the capacity to carry out a nuclear attack			1
last month , @entity1 scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the @entity27 and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the @entity129			2
it also recently pledged to restart a reactor at its main nuclear complex that had been shut down under an agreement reached in october 2007 during talks with the @entity35 , @entity7 and four other countries			1
@entity86 said monday that the @entity35 is concerned that @entity1 's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program could have consequences elsewhere in the world			1
" it is the belief of president @entity119 , myself and the administration that what happens here also has an impact on perceptions in places like @entity162 , the @entity163 and elsewhere where we 're engaged in nonproliferation efforts , " he said			0
@entity8 insists that its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the @entity35 and its allies			0
' no more artificial negotiations ' multilateral talks on @entity1 's nuclear program have ended in failure in the past , and @entity86 said the @entity35 is n't interested in going over old ground			1
" we 're not going to go through another cycle of artificial negotiations that are geared to simply attract some kind of aid or lull in events while they continue to pursue their devices ' designs , " he said			0
a @entity184 official said monday that there are no plans to move toward direct talks , " because @entity1 has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction			2
" on sunday , @entity8 rejected a different proposal for dialogue , one by @entity7 last week regarding the @entity1 's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate			2
a statement via @entity10 called the @entity7 's offer a " crafty trick " and " empty words without any content			2
" @entity86 's trip finished on one of the biggest dates on the @entity204 : " @entity205 , " when citizens celebrate the birthday of @entity24 , remembered as the " eternal president			0
" he died in 1994 and would have been 101 this year			0
current leader @entity114 paid tribute monday to @entity24 , his grandfather , as well as his late father , @entity211 , by visiting the halls where both men lie in state			0
it was believed to be the young leader 's first public appearance in two weeks			0
@entity86 said in @entity218 over the weekend that the @entity35 and @entity108 are calling on @entity1 to refrain from any provocative steps , including any missile launches			1
@entity8 made good on its promise to launch a long - range rocket around the time of @entity24 's birthday last year ; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea			0
@entity1 has made more threats since then			0
it launched a rocket in december that apparently put a satellite into orbit , and in response , the @entity232 approved broadening sanctions against the country			0
angered by those sanctions , @entity8 announced in january that it was planning its third nuclear test and more long - range rocket launches as part of what it called a new phase of confrontation with the @entity35			0
it carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in february , resulting in even tougher sanctions			0
those measures , along with the joint @entity35 - @entity7 military exercises in @entity7 , prompted an intensification in the @entity1 's threats			1
@entity0 's @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			0
