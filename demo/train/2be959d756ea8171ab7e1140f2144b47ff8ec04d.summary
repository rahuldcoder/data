@entity0 of thousands of supporters of @entity4 's new anti-austerity party filled central @entity5 on saturday , just a week after a like - minded party won national elections in @entity8			1
the new @entity4 party , @entity10 , aims for a repeat of the @entity8 scenario in @entity4 , with some polls already show it ahead of the incumbent conservatives and the main opposition @entity15 for national elections due later this year			1
podemos , which means " we can , " held its " @entity22 " at midday , filling the @entity4 capital 's emblematic @entity19 square and adjacent streets			2
it 's the same place where anti-austerity protests began four years ago during a deep economic crisis , and @entity10 is seen partly as an outgrowth of that movement , which leveraged social media to further its message			2
a leading newspaper , @entity30 , reported that @entity4 authorities estimated about 100,000 people took part on saturday , while @entity10 put the figure at 300,000			1
@entity30 ' own estimate , based on people density along the oft - used protest route , was about 150,000			0

he said saturday 's protest would start the countdown on @entity4 's conservative prime minister @entity45 , whose party has labeled @entity10 as a supposedly dangerous choice that ca n't possibly deliver on its promises			2
@entity40 was in @entity49 just before the @entity8 elections to support @entity51 , the anti-austerity party that would go on to win			1
@entity51 's leader , @entity52 , was in @entity5 late last year when @entity10 officially designated @entity40 as its leader			0
