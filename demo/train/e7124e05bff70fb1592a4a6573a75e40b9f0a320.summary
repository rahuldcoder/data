-- throughout his campaign , @entity2 presidential nominee @entity1 has cast himself as an ardent backer of @entity5 -- and , either directly or indirectly , suggested that president @entity6 has n't been similarly supportive			1
the former @entity8 governor lashed out again monday in a speech at the @entity10 , criticizing @entity6 on several points			0
among them was @entity5 , with @entity1 stating the relationship between @entity6 and @entity5 prime minister @entity14 " has suffered great strains " in recent years			1
" the president explicitly stated that his goal was to put ' daylight ' between the @entity19 and @entity5			1
and he has succeeded , " said @entity1			0
" this is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the @entity24 and emboldened our mutual adversaries , especially @entity27			0
" fact check : was @entity6 ' silent ' on @entity27 2009 protests ? vowing to " reaffirm our historic ties to @entity5 " and its security , @entity1 added , " the world must never see any daylight between our two nations			1
" so is @entity1 's characterization of @entity6 's remarks , and @entity19 relations with @entity5 , fair and accurate ? the facts : @entity6 's " explicit " statement @entity1 is referencing dates back to july 2009 , at a closed meeting between @entity6 and select @entity44 leaders			1
according to the @entity47 's account , concerns were building over the president 's reasoning on the @entity5 - @entity51 conflict			2
@entity6 sought to assure the leaders that he and his administration understood the " nuances of the current issues			2
" @entity56 , executive vice chairman of the @entity57 , told @entity6 , " if you want @entity5 to take risks , then its leaders must know that the @entity19 is right next to them			1
" " look at the past eight years , " @entity6 said , according to the @entity47			0
" during those eight years , there was no space between us and @entity5 , and what did we get from that ? when there is no daylight , @entity5 just sits on the sidelines , and that erodes our credibility with the @entity73 states			2
" complete coverage of @entity75 following the confusion that ensued over these comments , and their resurgence in the election season , administration officials have again and again defended the president and insisted there was indeed no " daylight " between the two countries			0
defense secretary @entity87 , speaking to reporters traveling with him in the @entity24 in july , said that new @entity91 sanctions against @entity27 would be " ratcheting up to a whole new level of impact			0
it sends a strong message to ( the @entity27 leadership ) that they ca n't continue to do what they are doing			0
" he emphasized that there is no disagreement between the @entity19 and @entity5 about @entity27			1
" my view is that when i sit down with my counterpart in @entity5 , we are unified in our view with regards to @entity27 , " @entity87 said			0
in response to reported disagreements between @entity6 and @entity14 on how specifically to handle curbing @entity27 's nuclear program , @entity19 ambassador to the @entity91 @entity110 told @entity0 's @entity111 , " we share a grave concern about @entity27 pursuing a nuclear weapon ...			1
we are determined to prevent that from happening			0
" president @entity6 has been absolutely clear , and on this there 's absolutely no daylight between the @entity19 and @entity5 that we will do what it takes to prevent @entity27 from acquiring a nuclear weapon			1
" @entity121 went on to say that the steps the @entity19 and other countries are taking to pressure @entity27 are working			0
speaking more generally in late july about cooperation between the two nations , @entity5 deputy prime minister and defense minister @entity125 described @entity19 support for @entity5 's security as unparalleled			1
" i should tell you honestly that this administration under president @entity6 is doing in regard to our security more than anything that i can remember in the past , " @entity125 told @entity0			2
despite such assertions , some have continued to insist that @entity19 - @entity5 relations have deteriorated since @entity6 took office			1
they include @entity140 , who told a @entity19 @entity141 in september that he believed the political relationship and cooperation between the two nations are the worst in two decades			2
notably , @entity140 had top @entity144 and national security - related positions under @entity2 presidents @entity146 and @entity148 and his writings are featured prominently on @entity1 's campaign website			0
conclusion : the @entity6 administration has stressed repeatedly that it is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with @entity5			1
in may 2011 , @entity6 said , " the bonds between the @entity19 and @entity5 are unbreakable , and the commitment of the @entity19 to the security of @entity5 is ironclad			1
" the exact context of @entity6 's remarks in his closed july 2009 meeting with @entity44 leaders is not clear			1
and it has n't been proven @entity6 " explicitly stated " then that it was " his goal " to put " daylight " between the two countries			2
his remarks , as reported , suggest rather that " our credibility with the @entity73 states " suffers when @entity19 and @entity5 policies are mirror images of each other			2
fact check : @entity1 's comparison of past , present @entity173 pointless in fact , @entity6 has on occasion offered views different from those of @entity14 , including calling on @entity5 to halt @entity179 settlement activity early in 2009			1
during the 2012 campaign , @entity1 has sought to assure voters that he will be tougher against @entity27 's nuclear ambitions than @entity6 , although the two candidates ' positions on @entity27 are nearly identical , according to a top @entity1 adviser			1
the @entity6 administration has hardly been soft against @entity27			0
in addition to voting for @entity189 sanctions against the country , in july 2010 , @entity6 signed legislation that aimed to make it harder for the @entity27 government to purchase refined petroleum and necessary materials to modernize @entity27 's oil and natural gas sector			0
the legislation also mandated that the @entity19 government will no longer grant procurement contracts to businesses doing prohibited business with @entity27			0
and the president signed an executive order pushing further sanctions against @entity27 in november 2011			0
there have been numerous reports of tensions and disagreements , and there have been times where @entity6 has expressed a view ( as on settlement activity ) not shared by his @entity5 counterpart			2
but any blanket assessment should also take into account assertions from the likes of @entity125 , lauding cooperation between the two nations over the last four years			0
opinion : @entity6 has bungled foreign policy fact check : @entity6 ' has not signed one new free - trade agreement ' @entity223 is ' ground zero ' of election			0

a report says @entity6 told @entity44 leaders the risks of " no daylight " between @entity19 , @entity5
@entity1 cites that remark , and claims " great strains " between @entity6 and @entity14
context of @entity6 's comments is *unclear* , and he never said " daylight " was his goal
