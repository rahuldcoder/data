-- rightly billed as a clash of tennis titans , @entity3 versus @entity4 , few were expecting the comprehensive manner of @entity7 's defeat of @entity8 to retain the @entity10 title monday night in @entity11			1
@entity8 will still end the year as the top ranked player in the world , but he was given a timely reminder that on the fast indoor surface of the @entity16 , @entity7 reigns supreme , retaining his title with a 6 - 3 6 - 4 victory			1
it came after just one hour 36 minutes on his third championship point , with @entity8 putting a forehand wide , rounding off an uncharacteristically tame display from the @entity23			0
@entity7 has been undefeated since losing to @entity8 in the final of the @entity25 in september and he deservedly lifted the trophy , named in honor of former @entity10 president @entity28 , who died earlier this year			1
after the gladiatorial style entrants by both men , it was @entity7 who struck the first blows , racing to a 3 - 0 lead with an early break of @entity8 's service			1
he had a point for a double break , but the @entity23 weathered the storm before making inroads on @entity7 's next service game to draw them level at 3 - 3			2
but @entity7 was not to be denied and after holding his own service , he broke @entity8 again , the decisive point seeing both men at full stretch with scarcely believable retrieving			2
@entity7 finally put away a decisive volley then held his own service , clinching the set with an ace			0
he was immediately on the front foot in the second set , breaking @entity8 early again to take a lead he never relinquished			0
@entity8 was under pressure as he served to stay in the match at 3 - 5 , saving the first match point and forcing his opponent to serve out for the championship			0
@entity8 at last showed glimpses of his true quality by saving a second championship point , but any hopes of an unlikely revival were quickly snuffed out as @entity7 sent down an ace to bring up his third chance to take the title for a third time			2
@entity8 still leads their career meetings 22 - 17 and will be looking to revenge the defeat when the 2014 season starts with the @entity74 in january			0
before that , @entity7 will lead @entity76 in the final of the @entity78 against the @entity79 , hoping to continue his unbeaten end to the season			2
earlier , @entity82 and his @entity84 compatriot @entity83 lifted the doubles title , beating the top seeds and three - time former champions @entity88 and @entity89 of the @entity90			1
@entity82 and @entity83 won a close final 7 - 5 6 - 7 10 - 7 in one hour and 44 minutes , succeeding @entity91 and @entity92 as winners of the end of season finale			1
they shared $ 335,500 in prize money , while the @entity98 -- five - time finalists -- split $ 195,500			0
