@entity0 , @entity1 -- they are some of the most spectacular diamonds , rubies and sapphires in the world , and they have graced the outfits of monarchs for centuries , now -- just in time for @entity13 's @entity12 -- @entity15 's @entity14 have gone on display in a new - look exhibition			1
" @entity19 are a collection of international significance , some of the most stunning gems in the world , " said curator @entity18			1
" but they are also a working collection , and we wanted to get that across to visitors ; that they are real , and that they are very much used , both during coronations and more regularly			2
" once through the heavy steel doors -- weighing 2,000 kilos each -- visitors are guided through the process of coronation , allowing them to feel part of the procession , with all its pomp and circumstance			0
after following a line of golden trumpets and heavy maces , they are introduced to the regalia of the ceremony : robes , anointing oil and ceremonial swords , before coming face to face with the fabled gems themselves , set in a succession of stunning crowns , scepters and orbs			0
fashion and treats fit for a queen even their names are the stuff of legend : @entity57 -- @entity58 , the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity62 's @entity61			2
some even come with their own superstitions			0
the @entity66 ( its name means " @entity68 " ) , for example , is only ever set in crowns made for female members of the monarchy			1
read more : the royal family tree " it is said to bring bad luck to any man who wears it , " explained @entity73 , the chief exhibitor of the jewels			0
" by contrast , it is believed to bring long life and happiness to any woman who wears it , and as its last wearer , queen elizabeth , the queen mother , was 101 when she died , that would seem to be true			0
" the jewels that visitors see today have been worn by @entity15 monarchs for generations , but in historical terms , @entity18 says , they are " a relatively new collection			1
" the originals were destroyed in the wake of the @entity95 , which saw @entity96 i overthrown and executed in 1649			0
the oldest piece on display is the 12th century @entity100 , which survived the break - up ( and melting down ) of the old jewels			1
many of the items in the @entity104 today date back to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , and the rule of @entity108 , though the collection has been added to and expanded over the centuries since			1
perhaps the most important piece is the @entity112 , which dates from 1661 , and is worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation			0
made of solid gold and trimmed with ermine and velvet , it is famously heavy -- weighing more than five pounds ( 2.23kg ) -- and can only be worn for 15 minutes during the ceremony			0
read more : what does the queen really do ? by contrast , queen @entity124 's tiny diamond - encrusted crown , made in 1870 , measures less than 10cm ( 3.7 inches ) tall			2
it was designed to be worn over her mourning veil , following the death of her beloved husband , @entity130			0
and while @entity13 @entity124 wore that miniature coronet so often it was eventually placed on her coffin , after her death , one of the other pieces , the @entity132 has only been used once			2
the crown , which features more than 6,000 diamonds , rubies , sapphires and emeralds , was made in 1911 at a cost of Â £ 60,000			0
it was used for the crowning of @entity146 at the @entity147 , because the traditional @entity14 are not permitted to leave the country , but has not been worn since			1
the new exhibition has been six years in the making , with most of the work being carried out overnight , to allow the @entity14 to remain on display throughout			1
thousands of visitors pour in to the @entity104 every day , though @entity73 insists " there are no queues here -- only ' lines of expectation			2
' " and the fact that the jewels are one of the key attractions for international visitors to @entity0 has played a large role in the way they are now displayed , with little writing and a reliance instead on imagery and film , from animations , to painting , to film of the @entity13 's 1953 coronation			1
" the point is not to tell people about the collection , but to show them -- the @entity14 are the stars of the show , " said interpretation manager @entity174			1
the exhibition also features dramatic lighting and sound effects , designed to allow the precious stones and gold to glow and shine in all their glory			1
" they are not relics , " said @entity174			0
" they are part of an active tradition , and they are still used today			0
" so while anyone making a trip to the @entity104 can expect to be greeted by plenty of glitz and sparkle whenever they visit , they should n't be too surprised if they find a small card in place of the @entity201 , reading simply : " in use			2

@entity15 's @entity14 contain some of the most famous precious stones in the world
the collection has been worn by members of the @entity15 monarchy for generations
