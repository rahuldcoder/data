-- it 's a congested , sprawling transport hub surrounded by 1950s architecture and predominantly used by commuters or tourists to cross the city of @entity6			1
but proposed changes to @entity8 have seen it become the flashpoint for protests that have swept through @entity12 in the past week , leaving thousands injured and focusing the world 's attention on the government of prime minister @entity17			1
@entity8 has been no stranger to violence			2
in 1977 , at least 34 protesters died during @entity21 clashes with police			0
may 1 rallies in the square were banned in 1980 and were only allowed to legally resume in 2010			0
on @entity21 this year , there were riots after city authorities again refused to grant trade unions and youth groups permission to demonstrate in @entity8 , blaming construction work being carried out in the square			2
professor @entity33 , professor of political science at @entity6 's @entity35 , said significantly , @entity8 was also known as " republic square , " because it was built by the @entity12 's founding fathers to commemorate the war of liberation			1
" @entity8 is connected to @entity40 -- @entity41 -- and @entity42 -- the @entity43			1
so there is a lot of symbolism that has to do with the @entity12 , " he said			2
read more : amid protests , @entity17 returns to @entity12 the @entity12 word " taksim " translates as " divide " and @entity33 said @entity8 was so - named because the area used to be the site of @entity6 's main reservoir , where the water was divided up			1
in the @entity57 and earlier , the area was only partially inhabited , he said , housing a military barracks and military training ground and a cemetery running down the slopes and a military hospital that still remains			0
" in the 1930s the cemetery was moved to another part of town and the area was opened up for apartment buildings -- and at one point it was one of the ' poshest ' parts of the city , " he said			0
" most of the apartment buildings face the @entity74 [ the strait that connects the @entity76 and the @entity77 ] , " he said			0
" because of its majestic view , [ @entity8 ] is an attraction in its own right			2
" it was estimated that millions of people went through the area to work every day , @entity33 said			0
since the protests , however , @entity8 has been blocked to traffic			1
this impromptu pedestrianization inadvertently reflects the authorities ' plan to divert all traffic from the square			0
@entity33 said plans to take the traffic underground included a pedestrian curb but after the tunnel was dug it was discovered that not enough room had been allowed for foot traffic			0
that was when the government decided to slice off part of @entity8 's @entity102 -- one of the last green spaces in @entity6 's center -- " which the ecologists and architects of the city started to argue against			1
" read more : is @entity110 's @entity109 ? " when machines were sent in to take down the trees , the people who had been protesting there tried to stop them and a row intervened between the construction company and the protesters -- and police intervened , " @entity33 said			1
but in an interview with @entity0 's @entity121 , @entity122 , the deputy chairman of @entity17 's @entity123 said the project for @entity8 had enjoyed cross-party support			1
" this project was actually supported by all the political parties in the city council and it was adapted unanimously at the city council , " @entity122 said			0
he added that the number of trees in the square would be increased by the project -- with plans to replant 10 of those being removed from @entity102			1
@entity122 denied reports that a mall was part of the project			0
" the building of a shopping mall has never been considered here in @entity8			2
what is [ being ] considered is the pedestrian way and putting car traffic under the tunnel and enlarging @entity8 , " he said			2
" only old military barracks is considered to rebuild			0
" watch : @entity12 politician denies mall was ever planned @entity12 's @entity149 past the barracks being reconstructed are from the 19th century , a period when @entity12 was still ruled by @entity149 sultans , who declared themselves the " caliphs " -- or spiritual leaders -- of the @entity157 world			1
in 1922 , first president of the @entity12 , @entity159 , sent the last sultan into exile and two years later , banned the caliphate and declared @entity12 a secular state -- so the ideals of the @entity12 clash with those of the country 's @entity149 past			1
the plans to rebuild @entity149 - era barracks had raised two different issues -- the physical change and the idea behind it , said @entity174 , professor of @entity176 history at @entity177 ( @entity177 ) , @entity178			1
" the idea -- building a replica of a past building - probably suggests to some people that the government 's trying to link itself to the @entity149 past			1
but of course the square does exist from the @entity149 period			0
" @entity174 said many people objected to a " kind of glorification " of the @entity149 era , which the early republic had tried to " ignore and denigrate			0
" @entity33 said the barracks had also been associated with the massacre of @entity196 army officers during a major uprising against constitutional rule in 1909			0
" in the minds of the people , [ the uprising ] was the conspiracy of the sultan who tried to get rid of the officers in 1908 by using religious provocation , " he said			0
" that left an indelible mark in the minds of the people that religion could be deployed as a major factor against modernization			0
" that concept was " at the very base " of @entity17 's @entity123 , @entity33 said			1
the plans for @entity8 also including the building of a mosque , he said			1
this meant " anybody objecting to the project would be objecting to a mosque " and the @entity123 was presenting objectors as atheist , secular , communist , anti-democratic and anti the people , he said			0
" the masses on their side will be conservative and @entity157 , " he said			0
the proposed mosque would also overshadow the statues of the major figures of the republic represented on the @entity231 in @entity8 , @entity33 said			1
@entity8 's lack of religious connotations was " probably one of the reasons that it was favored by the republic as a modern urban space , " @entity174 said			1
the plan to build a mosque in @entity8 was therefore " highly controversial and something that those with a secular orientation in the city and the country itself would resist , " he said			2
" the other side would see it as a natural place to have a mosque			0
" read more : why @entity12 are so angry the term " secular " -- most often understood in the @entity253 as referring to the separation of religion and government -- was often applied to @entity12 , @entity174 said			1
" but in @entity12 itself they use the @entity260 term ' @entity261			2
' in @entity12 you really have the situation that 's related to the founding of the republic - that the state will kind of control religion , " @entity174 said			1
" so , for example , the @entity268 is responsible for deciding the text that @entity157 clerics can deliver in their friday sermons			0
" @entity33 said the government also planned to demolish the @entity274			0
they [ @entity17 's government ] want to get rid of anything and everything to do with @entity159 , " he said			1
@entity33 suggested that another example of this was the government 's proposal to close down @entity283 -- @entity6 's main international hub -- and build a new airport in the north			1
he said this would involve excavating a new channel between the @entity76 and the @entity77			0
" all this to get rid of the name of @entity159			2
there 's a lot of ideological baggage			0
" ' contested space ' @entity174 said @entity8 had long being a contested space and plans to change it would always be likely to cause controversy			1
" because it 's such a central location and because of its particular make - up and associations -- whatever happens there will probably be heavily scrutinized and criticized , " he said			1
" @entity8 is a place where demonstrators habitually gather			1
there 's always a @entity21 protest for example			0
it 's a place where people would naturally gravitate -- it 's one of the few places where there 's a fairly large open space in the city , " he said			2
the current demonstrators have demanded @entity17 's resignation , accusing his government of creeping authoritarianism , while the prime minister has said the protests are part of an attempt by opponents who lost to his @entity123 to beat it " by other means			1
" " the issue of trees in @entity102 thing is just the trigger , " he said on monday			2
@entity33 said the number of protesters had surged after evidence emerged of a brutal police response to the initial @entity8 demonstration			1
he said the government had " started to argue that it was just a group of marauders " but that a huge majority seemed to be ordinary citizens , from all ages and walks of life and the government had eventually realized this and pulled the police out of the scene			2
in his interview with @entity121 , @entity347 -- @entity17 's deputy -- acknowledged that police had been heavy - handed and said their actions would be investigated but insisted that the government represented the @entity12 people			1
" at each election the people have been increasing their support for our government and our prime minister , " he said			0
" we are the democratic government and democratically elected parliament			0
" but @entity33 said the protests had spread spontaneously through @entity12 , " motivated by the same theme			2
" the government was " jumping on freedom of expression and freedom of the press , " he said			0
" the big issue there is , is of course freedom of expression and to be treated as stakeholders -- not as cockroaches			0
more is at stake than just @entity8			2

@entity8 was where @entity6 's water was distributed -- @entity8 means divide
the site is seen as symbolizing the seclar @entity12 republic founded by @entity159
@entity17 's government 's plans to alter @entity8 's @entity102 prompted protests
the police 's heavy - handed response saw demonstrators ' numbers surge
