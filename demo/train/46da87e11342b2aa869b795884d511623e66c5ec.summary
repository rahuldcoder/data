in the latest sign of his resolve to fight widespread official corruption , @entity1 president @entity0 presided over a leadership meeting monday to expel four senior members from the ruling @entity7 , including a retired top general of the two million - strong @entity9			1
gen. @entity12 , a former vice chairman of the @entity13 that runs the world 's largest standing army , was found to have accepted bribes , state - run @entity11 news agency reported			1
@entity12 was also a member of the country 's elite decision - making body , the @entity19 , before retiring in late 2012			2
the official probe into @entity12 , 71 , started in march and @entity7 investigators have found evidence of him and his family members receiving money and gifts from others , according to @entity11			1
@entity12 's case would be handed over to prosecutors for a court martial , making him the most senior military leader to face corruption charges in recent memory			1
in a statement released after monday 's @entity19 meeting , president @entity0 and other @entity1 leaders reiterated their " zero tolerance " for corruption in the government and military -- long a lightning rod for mass discontent across the country -- but they also acknowledged the anti-graft task would be " ongoing , complex and formidable			2
" the three other former senior officials ousted from the @entity7 for corruption were @entity48 , a former minister in charge of state assets ; @entity51 , a former vice minister of public security ; and @entity53 , a former deputy head of state - owned oil behemoth @entity54			1
' @entity57 and flies ' the announcement on @entity12 came on the heels of the downfall of @entity62 , a former vice chairman of @entity1 's top political advisory body			1
@entity62 , once a " state leader " in the official hierarchy , was formally removed from his post last wednesday over serious corruption allegations			2
state media has characterized @entity12 as a big " military tiger " caught in the massive anti-graft campaign launched by president @entity0 , who is also the commander - in - chief			1
after becoming the head of the @entity7 in late 2012 , @entity0 banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year - end gifts -- and vowed to target " tigers and flies " alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position			1
@entity11 recently touted the catching of 30 " tigers " since @entity0 took power less than two years ago			0
@entity84 some @entity1 watchers have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials to @entity84 , the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be under investigation for some time			0
@entity48 , @entity51 and @entity53 in monday 's announcement have long been considered @entity84 protégés			0
state media has reported official probes into many of @entity84 's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus , state oil industry and southwestern @entity101 -- three places @entity84 once ruled			1
if announced , @entity84 would become the highest - ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the @entity106			1
in 2013 , some 182,000 officials were disciplined while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases , according to the @entity7 's disciplinary commission			2
state media has cited the trial and conviction last year of former high - flying politician @entity114 -- though called politically motivated by @entity114 supporters -- as one prime example of president @entity0 's determination to clean up the party			0
' corruption endemic ' longtime @entity1 observers , however , point to the limits of president @entity0 's war on corruption			2
" corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going do it , " said @entity125 , a @entity126 - based commentator and columnist on @entity1 politics			0
" something has to be done about the system			0
" " there have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets			0
there has been no indication that they are going to do that			0
in fact , a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison , " he added			0
