@entity0 -- the prospect of @entity6 gov. @entity5 resigning as he copes with a federal investigation into the nearly $ 150,000 worth of lavish gifts the @entity9 and his family received from a wealthy executive is unlikely , people close to the governor insist			1
yet the topic remains a tantalizing conversation piece around @entity15 these days , mainly because it would be an act without modern precedent			0
while @entity6 has had its fair share of tumultuous politics over the years , not since @entity20 has the commonwealth been forced to grapple with a question of succession			0
no @entity6 governor has resigned , or been impeached , in the last century			0
@entity6 governor scandal : ' that 's not the guy we know ' but there 's another reason some @entity6 political watchers are buzzing about the hypothetical : @entity5 's resignation , however unlikely , would elevate his lieutenant governor , @entity9 @entity34 , to the state 's highest office			1
and @entity34 has made it abundantly clear he has little tolerance for the @entity9 running to succeed @entity5 -- attorney general @entity39			1
" i have serious reservations about his ability to effectively and responsibly govern our state , " @entity34 said of @entity39 in a recent interview with @entity1			1
candidates say @entity5 should consider resigning here 's the backstory : @entity34 has served as lieutenant governor since 2006 , and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor			1
@entity34 had @entity5 's endorsement , and campaign backing from other establishment leaders and members of @entity6 's influential business community			1
the ambitious @entity59 native , an uncompromising social conservative and tea party darling , also had designs on the governorship -- and he had no time for the succession plan orchestrated by @entity34 , @entity5 and other @entity9 leaders			1
so last year , @entity39 's allies in the @entity9 re-wired the @entity9 's nominating process so that the 2013 gubernatorial nominee would be selected by convention instead of a primary			2
since conventions tend to attract only a small slice of the electorate -- the most committed and vocal conservatives who revel in spending their spring weekends at political conventions -- that left @entity34 , who views the tea party movement with a mixture of scorn and exotic bewilderment , with little option but to drop out of the race			1
@entity5 's poll numbers fall as scandal unfolds an exasperated @entity34 left the race , and @entity39 easily captured the @entity9 gubernatorial nomination in may with the support of roughly 8,000 delegates who showed up at the @entity90 to support him ( and two other conservatives , attorney general candidate @entity93 and a bombastic pastor named @entity95 , the party 's nominee for lieutenant governor )			1
clearly incensed at @entity39 for dashing his gubernatorial hopes , @entity34 soon embarked on a media tour lamenting the rightward drift of the @entity9			1
he used his remaining campaign funds to launch an initiative called " the @entity103 " to recruit pragmatic @entity9 candidates and advance " responsible conservative policy solutions			0
" @entity34 's message was clear : hard - liners like @entity39 are eating away at the @entity9 from the inside , and hindering legislative compromise in @entity15			1
@entity39 's allies think @entity34 is a sore loser , bordering on irrelevance			2
@entity34 , freed from the pressures of campaign politics for the first time in nearly two decades , says he 's just speaking his mind			0
@entity5 points to ' irresponsible ' rumors " frankly , i do n't care what they think of me , " @entity34 said last month over lunch at a @entity120 restaurant in the @entity15 suburbs , several weeks before the @entity122 revealed some of the more explosive details of the unfolding @entity5 controversy			2
picking at a salad , the lieutenant governor characterized himself as a conservative , explaining that his first taste of politics came as a teenager in the coalfields of @entity6 , when he toiled on the 1972 re-election campaign of gov. @entity136 , a @entity9 in what was then a heavily @entity139 state			1
" the definition of what a conservative is has changed so much that now all of a sudden i look like a moderate , " he said			0
" the truth is that @entity34 is a conservative guy , always has been , always will be			0
but i am not an anti-government guy			0
i believe there is a role for government to play			0
" the conversation pivoted to @entity34 's central criticism of @entity39 -- that he is an ideologue uninterested in the sort of compromises needed to govern			2
" this is not just the most conservative ticket , but it is the most ideologically driven ticket that we have seen in the history of our state , " @entity34 said of the @entity156 - @entity93 tea party troika			1
@entity34 says he has " tried to be measured " in his public comments about @entity39			2
but that 's not really true			0
" the difference between us is the kinds of issues we focus on , the leadership style and demeanor that we demonstrate , " @entity34 said			0
" our willingness to compromise , to get things done			0
mr. @entity39 will have to run his campaign , and to win this election , he is going to have to convince people that he has the ability to govern @entity6 in a mainstream way			0
whether he can do that or not remains to be seen			0
" all of this , mind you , is coming from the man who would become chief executive if @entity5 were to leave office prematurely			0
new allegations against @entity5 emerge to the delight of @entity139 , it 's conceivable that the governor 's mansion could be occupied by a @entity9 who happens to be openly contemptuous of the @entity9 running to succeed him			1
@entity139 might enjoy that scenario almost as much as the one they have now , with @entity39 having to answer questions about his own ties to star scientific ceo @entity196 , the embattled executive who provided @entity5 and his family with undisclosed gifts like a @entity200 watch , a $ 15,000 @entity202 shopping spree and pricey catering for the wedding of the governor 's daughter			1
@entity39 also accepted gifts from @entity196 and owned stock in his company , though an investigation last week found he did not violate the state 's conflict of interest laws			1
" this is a no - win situation for @entity39 , " said @entity139 strategist @entity214 , a veteran of @entity6 campaigns			0
" if @entity5 somehow is able to remain in office , he 'll be a daily reminder of @entity39 's own ethical challenges with @entity220			1
if @entity34 assumes the governorship , not only will @entity39 still be under an ethical cloud , but the new governor will be a daily reminder of how even mainstream @entity9 view him as too extreme			1
" @entity34 's comments over the last few months to a spate of news organizations seem tailor - made for negative television ads and mail pieces : " do n't believe us ? here 's what @entity6 's own @entity9 governor had to say about @entity39 ... " @entity34 has even left the door open to voting for @entity39 's @entity139 opponent , @entity234 , who , he kindly pointed out , " takes a more pragmatic approach to politics and to governing			1
" at the moment , it does n't seem the @entity34 - as - governor scenario will come to pass			0
@entity34 is close with @entity5 and certainly is n't angling for the job			2
though he 's had designs on the governorship for years , taking over for @entity5 in the wake of scandal , with regular legislative business wrapped for the year , is n't much of a prize			2
nor could @entity34 suddenly decide to run for a full term -- the filing deadline to run in november passed in june			0
barring another devastating disclosure about the investigation , the only real pressure point for @entity5 as he braces for a tough final six months in office would be a chorus of resignation calls from legislators in his own party			2
but so far , not a single prominent @entity9 has called for @entity5 to leave office			2
meanwhile , @entity5 has hired a @entity0 - based crisis communications consultant and former @entity259 attorney to fight back against federal investigators , and some of his supporters launched a legal defense fund last week			0
those are n't the actions of a man preparing to step aside			0
but if he does , @entity39 and @entity6 @entity9 might only be trading in one headache for another .			2
