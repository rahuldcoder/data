@entity1 @entity0 told an audience of @entity5 donors in @entity6 on friday that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid			1
" @entity0 told the group of 30 or so guys that were there that he is considering a run for the @entity14 and that they could go tell their friends , " a source in the room told @entity2			1
the @entity16 first reported the comments			0
though his loyalists and supportive donors have floated his name as a potential candidate for the better part of a year , @entity0 himself has been more reticent about mounting another @entity14 bid after his 2008 and 2012 losses			1
but @entity0 's outlook has changed in recent weeks , according to people who have spoken with him recently , and he seems to be more serious than ever before			1
@entity0 has kept in close touch with his donors , many of whom have become close friends over two presidential cycles , according to one source close to @entity0 who was not at the meeting in @entity6 but is familiar with his thinking			1
@entity0 hosts an annual retreat each year in @entity38 for policy discussions — and used the two most recent gatherings in 2013 and 2014 to introduce them to potential 2016 presidential candidates including @entity42 and @entity43			1
( @entity44 was invited to speak last summer , but could not attend because of previous commitments , including his father 's birthday )			1
many of @entity0 's @entity6 donors , who are in frequent touch with him , had suggested a lunch or get - together when @entity0 was in @entity6 , which resulted in the meeting with donors on friday as he was on his way back from @entity57 's swearing in as the new governor of @entity59 , this person said			1
former aides to @entity0 have said that his thinking about the race has evolved over several months , particularly after he had time to reflect on being back on the campaign trail for the midterm races			2
as former @entity66 gov. @entity44 has moved toward a bid , many donors had pressed him for a signal about his level of interest			1
" he had not closed his mind on this , and today was the day that he decided to share that with the group of people he was with , " the source familiar with @entity0 's thinking said			2
" his conviction that the country is on the wrong track is very strong			0
he 's very concerned with @entity81 's role in the world			0
nothing has changed on that			0
" as far as re-entering the field for the @entity5 nomination , the source said , " he knows he would have to earn it , he knows no one is handed the nomination , but he 's giving it some thought ...			0
his head has n't changed , i think he was just formalizing it a little bit , " at the friday meeting , the source said , to let donors know he was considering a bid more seriously			2
@entity0 's comments come in the wake of @entity44 's stepped - up political activity			1
@entity44 , @entity0 and @entity103 gov. @entity43 — all favorites of the @entity5 establishment and @entity6 donor community — would presumably draw from the same pool of financial backers			1
" i think he is serious , " said the person at the @entity6 meeting			0
" one of the first things he said he said was , ' people ask me , do you want to be president ? well , yes , i did run twice			0
" @entity0 said that his wife , @entity119 , is " very encouraging " about 2016 , the source said , but his sons are split about the idea , the source who was in the room said			2
the source familiar with @entity0 's thinking also said @entity119 is " supportive of it " if that 's what @entity0 wants			2
" i do n't think he would have come to this without talking to his family			0
" at the heart of this , this source adds , is that " the state of the country has n't settled for him			0
he wo n't be happy sitting on the sidelines			0
" the former @entity59 governor told the crowd that a potential campaign would " have to have a positive message			0
" he also said , somewhat obviously , that he " would run a different campaign from what he 's run in the past			0
" @entity0 entertained questions about the rest of the potential 2016 field but had only positive things to say about his would - be rivals , the source said			1
the news comes after a week chock - full of high - profile potential @entity5 presidential candidates taking the first steps toward announcing their candidacy for the 2016 election			2
former @entity66 gov. @entity44 launched a @entity156 this week , just days after resigning his position on various corporate and nonprofite boards			0
and former @entity5 presidential contender @entity159 quit his show on @entity161 last week to give 2016 some serious consideration			0
and @entity2 reported wednesday that @entity164 gov. @entity163 is assembling a team for a potential 2016 presidential bid			1
the revelation of @entity0 's overtures to top @entity5 donors is yet another addition to the long - term game of footsy @entity0 has played with the media and other @entity5 who would like to know whether @entity0 is in or out -- though it 's certainly the most definitive and serious indication that @entity0 might actually launch a third presidential bid			1
@entity0 was rumored to be through with his presidential ambitions after a grueling 2012 run , but this summer he made several head nods that he was considering			2
@entity0 told the @entity180 this summer that " we 'll have to see what happens " and said in another interview that the chances were very slim -- but conceded there was nonetheless always a chance			1
" we never say never , " @entity187 said on @entity2 's " @entity188 " this summer			0
@entity189 contributed to this report .			0
