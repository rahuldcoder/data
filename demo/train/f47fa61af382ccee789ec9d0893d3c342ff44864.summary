-- a rogue trader has cost @entity4 an estimated $ 2 billion , the @entity2 banking giant announced thursday , revealing what could be the third - largest loss of its kind in banking history			1
a $ 2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented , market analyst @entity9 told @entity0			1
" we have only had three or four other situations ... in the billions , and that is exactly what happened , " he said			0
the bank is large enough to take a $ 2 billion hit , experts said			0
shares in @entity4 were down 11 % on the @entity20 stock exchange at midday trading , though , even as @entity23 markets closed higher thursday			1
police arrested a man on suspicion of fraud in an early - morning operation in @entity30 's banking district hours before the loss was announced , they said			1
@entity4 contacted the police at 1 a.m. about an allegation of fraud , and a 31 - year - old man was arrested at work two and a half hours later , police commander @entity32 said			1
@entity39 media named the suspect as @entity4 trader @entity41 , 31			1
@entity0 has not independently confirmed his identity , but was told when calling his desk at @entity4 that he was not available			1
the bank declined to comment on the arrest			0
news of the rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in @entity23			1
markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that @entity53 might default on its huge debt , sending shock waves through the 17 - nation eurozone and further afield			0
just this week , the credit rating agency @entity58 downgraded two @entity60 banks			0
on thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at @entity4 -- came word that the @entity64 and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to @entity23 's struggling banks			1
the @entity71 , along with the @entity64 , the @entity70 , the @entity68 and the @entity69 , said three @entity20 dollar auctions would be held to help out @entity23 banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt			0
@entity23 banks have seen @entity20 dollars flow out as @entity20 financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to @entity23 banks , amid fears over those institutions ' exposure to debt held by @entity53 and other @entity23 nations			0
@entity20 treasury secretary @entity85 is to attend a meeting of @entity23 's @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , on friday , at which questions around @entity53 debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed			0
finance ministers for the @entity96 member states , central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present			0
the conference comes ahead of @entity102 and @entity103 meetings later this month			0
as to the episode at @entity4 , @entity9 , the analyst , outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place : intentional fraud , " basic stupidity " in trading strategy , or what the banking industry calls " fat fingers , " which means typing the wrong number by accident			1
perhaps the trader " put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem , " @entity9 said			2
@entity121 , a former trader who is now a partner at @entity122 in @entity30 , said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job			2
" trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year , " said @entity121			2
" with the volatility in banking stocks , commodities and currencies , things can go wrong really , really easily			0
if you 're worried about your job and you try to hide ( a mistake or loss ) , you can see how these situations arise			2
" a bank 's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader 's activities , he said			2
" he must have done something that he was n't supposed to do , obviously , " @entity121 said			0
@entity4 said no client positions were affected by the loss , which is still being investigated			1
but the " unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank " could cause @entity4 to post a loss in the third quarter of this year , it said			1
the loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading			1
rogue trader @entity155 cost his @entity60 bank , @entity156 , almost $ 6 billion , and was sentenced to three years in prison last year			1
@entity158 cost @entity159 $ 2.6 billion in the global copper market , and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997			2
@entity164 , the subject of the @entity167 movie " rogue trader , " lost about $ 1.3 billion for his bank , @entity170 , in 1995 , forcing it to close			1
@entity4 is not likely to collapse , but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company , @entity121 said			1
there is a " much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up " into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients ' exposure to investment banking losses , he said			2
he favors that alternative , he said			0
" the banks are too large , " @entity121 said			0
" the products are so complicated , and the management does n't understand it			0
" @entity4 made a pre-tax profit of about $ 1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year , it announced in july , down from about $ 2.5 billion the quarter before that			2
@entity0 's @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 itself reported the rogue trader to police , *officers* say
@entity39 media name the arrested man as @entity41
the loss could be caused by anything from fraud to " stupidity , " an expert says
it would be among the largest losses in unauthorized trading
