-- this weekend at the box office , a superhero comedy , a @entity4 biopic , and a @entity6 thriller all got served by a butler			1
" @entity8 , " to be exact			1
the @entity10 's awards - bait drama , which stars @entity11 and @entity12 , topped the chart with an excellent $ 25 million from 2,933 theaters in its first frame			2
audiences issued the well - reviewed picture an enthusiastic " a " @entity19 grade , which sets it up for a lucrative box office run as summer draws to a close			1
" @entity8 " opened in the same range as " the help , " which found $ 26 million in its first weekend in august 2011			1
like that film , " @entity8 " tells a racially charged story that is playing particularly well with older women			1
according to @entity29 , crowds were 60 percent female and 76 percent above the age of 35			2
@entity12 's presence no doubt helped lure in many of those ticket - buyers , as did " @entity8 " 's " inspired by a true story " cachet			1
time will tell whether the film can match " @entity41 " 's $ 169.7 million total , but given " @entity8 " 's low $ 30 million cost , it does n't need to hold particularly well to become a major success			1
of course , with its positive reception and its reputation as the first @entity49 contender of 2013 , " @entity8 " should have no trouble performing at least as well as 42 , which ran away with $ 95 million after a $ 27.5 million opening earlier this year			1
@entity29 may have a true cash cow on its hands			2
" we 're the @entity59 " maintained its spot in second place			1
the pot - smuggling comedy , which stars @entity61 and @entity62 , fell only 33 percent in its second weekend to $ 17.8 million and has now lit up $ 69.5 million worth of tickets against a trim $ 37 million budget			2
" @entity59 " is now a lock to surpass $ 100 million at the domestic box office , which would make it @entity69 ' second film to reach the milestone ( alongside his previous @entity62 team - up , " @entity72 " ) , and @entity62 's sixth			1
12 comic stripper scenes last weekend 's champ , " @entity76 , " took a major hit in its sophomore frame			1
the $ 115 million sci - fi film dropped 54 percent — the largest fall in the top 10 — to $ 13.6 million , which gives the tepidly received spectacle a $ 55.9 million total			1
currently , " @entity76 " seems headed for an $ 85 million to $ 90 million finish — well below director @entity87 's $ 115.6 million finish for " @entity88			1
" down in fourth place , @entity91 's " @entity90 " stumbled in its opening weekend with a meager $ 13.5 million			2
that 's a big step below the original " @entity93 , " which debuted to $ 19.8 million en route to $ 48.1 million total in 2010			2
while that was hardly an eye - popping total , @entity91 pushed ahead with a sequel based on " @entity90 " ' popularity in geek circles and its strong home video sales			0
unfortunately , few people were very interested in the sequel ( including star @entity105 , who would not do any publicity for the r - rated film after deciding he would not promote violence )			0
" @entity90 , " which fortunately cost only $ 28 million , extends the streak of under - performing sequels that has plagued @entity111 over the past month			0
" @entity112 , " " @entity113 2 , " " @entity114 , " and " @entity115 : @entity118 " have all failed to match their predecessors ' grosses			0
audiences were 63 percent male and 58 percent below the age of 25 , and they awarded the film a " @entity123			0
were these sequels necessary ? " planes " descended 41 percent in its second weekend to $ 13.1 million , which brings the $ 50 million animation 's total to $ 45.1 million			0
obviously , that 's not a " @entity136 " or " @entity138 " - sized number , but given " planes " ' relatively low cost ( and gigantic merchandise appeal ) , it 's flying high enough to keep @entity135 happy			0
@entity8 -- $ 25 million 2			1
we 're the @entity59 -- $ 17.8 million 3			2
@entity76 -- $ 13.6 million 4			1
@entity90 -- $ 13.5 million 5			2
planes -- $ 13.1 million two newcomers finished outside the @entity142			0
" @entity4 , " @entity144 ' @entity4 biopic starring @entity145 , did n't sync with moviegoers and floundered with $ 6.7 million			1
fortunately , the picture cost only $ 12 million to produce — or about the amount that @entity149 has earned since you started reading this sentence			0
meanwhile , " @entity154 , " a $ 40 million thriller starring @entity153 and @entity6 , fared even worse			0
the relativity - acquired film grossed a truly terrible $ 3.5 million from 2,459 theaters , yielding a $ 1,423 theater average			0
the misfires were issued " b -- " and " @entity19 grades , respectively			0
in limited release , " @entity161 " continued to impress			0
the @entity163 - directed film starring @entity164 increased its theater count from 119 to 229 locations but maintained a robust $ 10,303 average , which gave it $ 2.4 million for the weekend			0
after four weeks , " @entity161 " has earned a remarkable $ 9.5 million			0
next weekend , " the @entity169 , " " @entity170 " and " @entity171 " all hit theaters			0
