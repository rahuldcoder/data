-- @entity2 investigators reviewing a hard drive belonging to the captain of missing @entity6 have found that there were deletions of information even closer to the final flight than first indicated by @entity12 officials , @entity2 law enforcement officials tell @entity0			1
the forensic search of the computer files by government experts found files were removed even after february 3 , the date @entity12 authorities have cited for when some data was cleared from the drive of the captain			1
investigators are examining the contents of drives belonging to both pilots			2
copies of the hard drives are at the @entity29 's forensics lab facilities in @entity30 , @entity31 , and one is being analyzed with the assistance of consultants the @entity29 uses to help analyze such electronic data			0
it 's not clear why @entity12 officials cited the february 3 date and if they knew of the other deletions			1
the type of software used for flight simulation takes up a lot of room in hard drives and investigators believe that could be one reason for deletion of files			1
it 's possible too that some damage could have been done during the first examinations done by @entity12 investigators			2
law enforcement officials say that they are n't drawing any conclusions about the subsequent deletions , or the earlier ones , just two days into reviewing the hard drive contents , which officials described as a large volume of data			0
more could n't be learned about the nature of the deletions , and who made them			0
some senior @entity2 counterterrorism officials say that an accident is the leading operative theory as cause for the disappearance of flight 370			1
that 's because there is no other information indicating foul play			0
" barring other information to suggest otherwise one has to first think this was a tragic accident , " a @entity2 law enforcement official said			1
but investigators have not ruled out terrorism or other theories			2
investigators have focused on the pilots because of the lack of any other information			0
but there is n't proof that they did anything wrong			0
@entity2 investigators have compiled profiles of the two pilots , based on interviews with friends , neighbors and family members conducted by @entity12 investigators , and on a search of their online activities , @entity2 officials say			1
those interviews have n't turned up anything that could suggest any explanations for the plane 's disappearance			0
@entity2 investigators also are concerned about the preservation of evidence in @entity12			1
@entity12 authorities waited six days to search the pilots ' homes			0
this was enough time , @entity2 officials believe , for someone who had access to the homes perhaps to have tampered with evidence			1
they do n't know if there was any tampering but it is a worry because @entity12 officials did n't appear to secure evidence immediately			0
@entity2 officials say they understand that there are @entity12 legal restrictions and requirements for probable cause before such searches			2
the difference in procedures is a common issue in international investigations such as this .			0

@entity2 investigators found evidence files deleted even after february 3
leading @entity2 theory is disappearance was result of accident
@entity2 has compiled profile of pilot and *co-pilot*
