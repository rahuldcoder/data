@entity0 , @entity1 of explosives , @entity1 interior minister @entity3 said			0
the pre-dawn raids took place in @entity11 , the largest @entity7 city in northern @entity1 , and the nearby town of @entity14 , where police also found bomb - making components , @entity3 said in a nationally televised news conference			2
@entity1 media , citing police sources , said the suspects are linked to @entity6 's killing two years ago of a police intelligence officer in the @entity7 region , but @entity3 only would confirm that investigators were analyzing possible links to a series of unsolved @entity6 attacks			1
the arrests come during a unilateral @entity6 cease - fire which the outlawed group declared january 10 , promising it would be " permanent , general and verifiable			1
" but the @entity33 government has repeatedly said it would not ease the police pressure against @entity6 , which in 2006 broke an earlier " permanent " cease - fire with a car bomb at @entity0 's airport that killed two men and caused extensive damage			1
@entity3 said the arrests tuesday have " enormous importance " because the four are suspected of operating clandestinely for @entity6 , under the cover of living and working " as normal citizens , integrated into @entity7 society , which makes it very difficult for police to find them			1
" police have worked to locate these suspected clandestine operatives for more than two years , since the arrest of a suspected @entity6 military chief in november 2008 , @entity3 said			2
the suspects include two men and two women , ranging in age from 31 to 37 years old , the @entity53 said in a statement , adding that police also seized three firearms and forged identity documents for the @entity7 regional police force in the raids			0
@entity6 is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades - long fight for @entity7 independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity68 and the @entity69			1
@entity6 's last killing in the @entity7 region was in 2009			2
a senior police intelligence officer , @entity72 , died when a limpet bomb -- which attaches to its target magnetically -- exploded under his car			0
it is among a number unsolved @entity6 attacks over the past few years			0
on january 18 , a week after @entity6 's latest cease - fire announcement , police arrested 10 people , most of them for alleged links to a shadowy group called @entity84 , which authorities say passes directives from @entity6 's leadership to a string of equally shadowy support groups			1
" the government 's anti-terrorist policy has not changed at all because @entity6 has not definitively abandoned its weapons			0
and as long as it does n't , the police will continue to arrest them , one after another , " @entity3 said .			0
