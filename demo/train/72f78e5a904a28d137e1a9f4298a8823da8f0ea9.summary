@entity0 -- defense lawyers for two sisters accused of embezzling money from celebrity chef @entity5 and her ex-husband @entity6 argued wednesday that they were caught in the middle of a personal battle			1
prosecution claims that @entity10 and @entity11 embezzled money have not been proved , their respective defense lawyers said in their closing arguments in a west @entity0 court			1
both defense lawyers questioned @entity5 's credibility as a witness and said their clients ' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue			1
the case has gripped @entity25 media , thanks to revelations of drug use by @entity29 and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to @entity33 , a millionaire art collector			1
both sisters deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the couple , saying their personal spending on @entity33 's company credit cards was authorized by @entity29			1
@entity29 and @entity33 divorced this year after a very public argument at a @entity0 restaurant			1
@entity42 's defense lawyer , @entity41 , told the jury that @entity10 was the " soft underbelly " by which @entity33 was attacking @entity29 , adding that his client had been very close to the chef and her family			1
" my client has been caught in a collateral crossfire like a child in an acrimonious divorce , " he told the court			0
the jury must be sure that @entity29 had not authorized her spending " explicitly or implicitly " over the four years in question if they were to convict @entity10 , the lawyer said			1
@entity57 , representing @entity11 , said she had made no attempt to hide her spending , so it was impossible for @entity29 to say she was ignorant of it			1
she also stressed that @entity29 was not on trial			2
" this is not a day for you to say ' ooh , i like miss @entity5 , i like her cooking programs , ' " she told the jury			2
" this is a trial of my client			0
" @entity57 added that the prosecution had failed even to pin down the amount @entity11 is alleged to have embezzled			2
' bolder and greedier ' however , @entity72 , giving the prosecution 's closing argument in the case , said that the sisters had abused their position " time and time again " and that they " grew bolder and greedier " as time went by			0
" just because @entity33 is a wealthy man , obviously it does n't mean he should be defrauded by the staff , " @entity72 said			0
" that seems to be what the defense are putting forward			0
" @entity72 said both sisters admitted they had used the company cards , given to them for household expenses , for personal expenditure			0
when they were first asked about that spending by @entity33 's accountant , they at no point argued then that it had been authorized , she said			2
they had sent a letter to @entity29 and @entity33 apologizing for the personal expenditure and had offered to pay it back , she said			1
the sisters knew @entity29 had used cocaine after the cancer diagnosis of her late first husband and used the revelation to cause a sensation at the trial , @entity72 said			2
she told the jury the only possible verdict in the case was guilty			0
' a case with no winners ' allegations of repeated drug use by @entity29 have played a central part in the evidence presented to the court			0
the @entity11 sisters , while acknowledging that they had never seen @entity29 taking drugs , both said they had seen indications of frequent cocaine and cannabis use			1
@entity41 said the allegations about @entity29 's drug use were relevant because the issue had an impact on the chef 's credibility			2
the only real evidence about @entity10 's spending was from @entity29 , he said			1
" this is a case with no winners , " @entity41 said			0
" not mr. @entity6 , not ms. @entity5 and certainly not my client			0
" @entity57 suggested the court could not trust @entity29 's evidence because it was not in her interest for the truth about her drug use -- which was hidden from her then - husband -- to emerge			2
she said that if @entity29 had admitted authorizing the @entity11 sisters ' expenditure , @entity33 " would have been on her back			1
" @entity29 had to think of a way " to stop the dark secret coming out , " @entity57 said			1
" there was a massive attempt to limit the damage			0
" she added , " my client is somewhat piggy in the middle			0
" ' a life problem ' in her own testimony , @entity29 confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times , during two periods of her life , and used cannabis in the past			0
but she denied being a habitual user , saying , " i did not have a drug problem ; i had a life problem			0
" @entity6 had said in an e-mail that @entity29 had used drugs regularly , but in his testimony before the court last month , he backed off that claim			0
in the e-mail , which the defense shared with the court at a pretrial hearing , @entity6 wrote that the two assistants would probably " get off " because @entity29 was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and " allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked			1
" recounting @entity33 's testimony , @entity72 said he had never intended for that e-mail to be made public			2
he was being particularly nasty at a time he was upset after their separation and divorce , she said			0
like the @entity11 sisters , @entity6 told the court he had never seen @entity29 taking drugs , @entity72 said .			1
