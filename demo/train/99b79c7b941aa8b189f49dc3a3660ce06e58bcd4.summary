-- @entity3 has been an unreliable ally of the @entity2 in the war against @entity6 and other extremist organizations , @entity2 vice president @entity1 told @entity0 in an interview set to air in full monday night			1
@entity1 , who spoke to @entity0 's @entity10 on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks , said @entity3 has failed " on occasion " when forced to choose between the @entity2 and @entity6			1
the price of @entity3 's choices has been the " loss of life of @entity2 soldiers in @entity20 , " the vice president said			1
@entity22 has " been very helpful in other times , " he added			2
" but it 's not sufficient			0
they have to get better			0
we need a relationship that is born out of mutual interest			0
and it 's in their interest that they be more cooperative with us			0
" " we are demanding it , " he said			0
@entity6 leader @entity34 was killed by @entity2 forces in a compound in @entity37 , @entity3 , in may			1
@entity3 's government -- which has struggled with significant pro-al @entity6 sentiment within its borders -- was not informed of the attack beforehand			2
@entity3 authorities insist they did not know @entity34 's location			2
despite troubles in @entity3 and elsewhere , the @entity2 is " getting close " to bringing about an end to organized , legitimized terrorist activities , @entity1 said			1
" we have done great damage to ... @entity6 , " he said			0
" satellite organizations " have emerged in @entity50 and elsewhere , he said , but " they are less coordinated " and " less capable			0
" " and we 're relentless in pursuing them , " he added			0
as a result , @entity2 are safer today than they were a decade ago , @entity1 asserted			1
regardless , the vice president cautioned that " there is always a possibility of a lone wolf " attack within the @entity2 or elsewhere			1
" there 's always a possibility of an incident occurring , but i do not believe there 's anyone right now capable of putting together the kind of extremely complicated planned operation that took place on 9/11 , " he said			2
@entity1 said he believes that in 25 years , @entity2 will " read about this period of terror as ... a part of a chapter in the history of this country			1
" the vice president denied former vice president @entity76 's assertion that controversial interrogation techniques such as waterboarding -- stopped by the @entity80 administration -- would help generate useful intelligence in the war against @entity6 and other organizations			1
" i 've seen zero evidence that it works , and i think there 's abundant evidence that it hurts us internationally			0
it hurts our security , " @entity1 said			2
it does so , he said , " by making a mockery of who we say we are and giving rationale for those who want to do us harm to recruit people			0

@entity2 vice president @entity1 tells @entity0 @entity3 has not been a reliable ally
