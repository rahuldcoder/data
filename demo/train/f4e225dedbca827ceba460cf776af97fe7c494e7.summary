@entity0 -- the @entity3 , perhaps for the final time , has rejected a multistate appeal over efforts to keep the invasive @entity7 carp from reaching the @entity9 ecosystem			0
the justices turned aside another request for intervention monday , the latest chapter in a nearly century - old dispute between six @entity16 states and the @entity18 province of @entity19			1
at issue is a direct challenge to @entity23 ' complex water diversion and sewage disposal network , which some predict will inadvertently allow the non-native fish to enter @entity27			1
some environmentalists and lawmakers fear an economic and ecological disaster if the creatures breach man - made barriers			0
and there are concerns that the fish may have already slipped past locks and entered the massive freshwater bodies of water			1
the fish can grow up to 4 feet in length and 100 pounds in weight , reproduce rapidly and can gobble up to 40 percent of their body weight daily , quickly out - competing less aggressive native fish populations			2
the high court has refused to intervene in the case twice in recent months			1
some activists say @entity46 could file another appeal in federal court , but it could take months to resolve			0
the justices were asked to grant a preliminary injunction , which would have forced @entity23 to immediately close down much of its @entity52 - area shipping locks and dams , and would have prompted rapid construction of a fish - proof barrier			1
the voracious @entity7 carp have migrated up the @entity57 to the @entity52 suburbs			0
state officials , businesses , and environmentalists fear that it is only a step away from triggering a swift economic disaster across the @entity9 , saying that once in @entity27 they would spread quickly to @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity19 and @entity67			1
" what could be at stake is the multibillion - dollar fishing industry -- commercial , sports fishing , and recreational fishing industries -- in the @entity9 , " said @entity73 of the @entity74 , noting that the lakes constitute " the largest freshwater body on @entity77 , and we have to protect it at all costs			1
" dna from the carp was found in december closer to @entity27 than ever before -- at a @entity83 , @entity23 , pumping station along the lake shore -- raising fresh concerns that the fish has breached an electric barrier placed along a maze of canals and locks in @entity23			1
in a signal of the urgency , @entity46 , @entity93 and @entity94 have repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked the high court to order those locks closed immediately			1
among those being sued are @entity52 's local water reclamation agency and the @entity99 , which helped build and maintain the canal system			2
@entity23 officials say other states and the federal courts do not have the legal authority to order the closing of any federally approved water management projects			1
there are fears that shutting down the locks would lead to massive flooding and cripple the area 's commercial shipping industry			2
the term " @entity114 " is actually an umbrella name for at least four large varieties of fish considered nuisance invasive species : the grass , black , silver and bighead carp			0
related to common goldfish , the bigger types are prolific jumpers , easily spooked out of the water by passing watercraft , and numerous boaters have been injured by inadvertent flying fish collisions			2
biologists have been tracking their northern migration ever since they were imported in the 1960s , traced to an @entity134 fish farmer			0
several of the fish escaped during a flood in the 1990s and quickly expanded their range			0
their possible presence just miles from the lakes prompted the latest lawsuit over the so - called @entity143 , a project started in the late 1800s to prevent the city 's sewage from contaminating @entity27			1
the project involved reversing the flow of the @entity148 , connecting it and two other nearby rivers with the @entity57 basin			0
that created a connection between the @entity9 and the @entity57 , helping fuel an economic boom in the nation 's third largest metropolitan area			0
in 1922 , @entity93 sued @entity23 to stop the growing water diversion , since other states relied on the drinking water			1
all other lake states except @entity162 joined suit , and the @entity3 eventually agreed with them , ordering mitigating effects over @entity23 ' diversion			1
now several of those states are asking the justices to reopen the old cases			2
such interstate disputes over boundaries and shared natural resources are one of the few instances where appeals can go directly to the @entity3 , instead of first being heard in lower courts			0
the @entity178 administration is supporting @entity23			2
in a filing with the high court last fall , solicitor general @entity179 argued that although allowing the carp to enter the @entity9 would produce " grave and irreparable harm , " it was only " speculative " that the harm would occur " imminently			1
" she suggested that @entity46 and other states were more interested in relitigating disputes over removal of water from the lakes than seeking to stop fish from entering the lakes			2
the other states and @entity18 want the @entity23 water diversion projects be declared a " public nuisance " because of the carp emergency			1
of more immediate concern , they want @entity23 and federal officials to modify their fish - control facilities -- including electric fences -- to ensure that the fish stay away from the lakes			1
electric barriers were set up in 2002 in the @entity205 , about 33 miles from @entity27			2
they became fully operational last year , but @entity208 engineers acknowledge that the barrier is not 100 percent effective			0
it is designed not to kill carp but to discourage them from going further			0
" we can control what the fish feels , basically , " said col. @entity213 , commander of the @entity214 of the @entity99			0
" what they feel is a jolt or a tingle			0
it 's an electric current in the canal being created by our barriers			0
" another underwater barrier is set for completion this year			0
the cases are @entity93 , @entity46 , @entity94 v. @entity23 and @entity229 ( 1 , @entity230			0

justices wo *n't* get involved in dispute between six states , @entity19
some say @entity23 water system will allow huge fish into @entity27
multibillion - dollar fishing industry could be at stake , official says
high court has repeatedly been asked to close locks and dams
