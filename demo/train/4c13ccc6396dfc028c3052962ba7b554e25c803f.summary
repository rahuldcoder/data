-- " the last couple of weeks i 've been at home have been murder with the traffic , " bemoans @entity7 resident @entity6			1
like most @entity11 protagonists , the @entity9 man loves the thrill of racing in the @entity13 -- it 's just that he is less keen on @entity7 's traffic jams in the build - up to the race			1
" it 's been a nightmare , " the @entity19 driver , who recently moved back to the principality from the @entity22 island of @entity23 , told @entity0			1
" putting up the grandstands takes a long time so the city does change quite a bit			0
" in the winter it 's pretty quiet			0
you see a lot of people that you know and i train with the same people			0
@entity7 is like a quiet , peaceful village really			1
there 's also a new @entity41 pub that i like -- there 's a good pint of @entity44 there ! " @entity6 , @entity46 's @entity45 and @entity48 ' @entity47 are just a handful of @entity11 racers who have mixed business with pleasure by calling @entity53 their home			1
@entity48 driver @entity55 , son of @entity57 's 1982 world champion @entity56 , can boast that he grew up there			0
it makes sense for wealthy drivers to live in @entity53 -- after all , the independent state on the @entity63 has thrived on its reputation as a playground for the rich and famous since the late 1800s			1
just as importantly its tax laws are favorable compared to its @entity68 neighbors			0
but for one weekend in may the streets of @entity7 are not just for the well - heeled -- they are for racing on			1
the precipitous , winding roads have evolved into a thrilling street circuit ready to host this weekend 's grand prix			0
the most famous race in @entity11 -- a fixture on the calendar since 1950 -- brings a change of pace to @entity53 's @entity80 idyll			1
the metamorphosis , overseen by the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , takes two months to complete and calls on the expertise of 200 construction workers to build 1,100 tonnes of grandstands , 900 tonnes of pit garages and 21 miles of safety barriers			2
the street circuit has one of the smallest capacities on @entity11 's calendar , with a total of 200,000 fans expected to watch the cars from the grandstands , hotel balconies and terraces -- not forgetting the yachts moored in the harbor -- over the weekend			1
a crowd of 200,000 may sound small but when the pocketsize principality is less than two square kilometers -- half the size of @entity104 's @entity103 -- that is quite a crowd to pack in			2
" the place is a little quieter the rest of the year , " says @entity106 , deputy manager of the @entity107 , which overlooks the @entity11 circuit in the heart of @entity7			1
" during these four days people are living day and night			0
there are parties in the harbor , on every terrace , so as @entity7 is a tiny place , every place is crowded , " she told @entity0			2
" there are other busy weekends in @entity53 such as the open tennis tournament , the boat show in september and the @entity124 but for this weekend of the grand prix it is very unusual			2
" thousands of people come for the day to @entity53 , all the hotels are full , the restaurants are packed and we have many yachts in the harbor			2
this is most definitely the busiest one			0
" for the month of may , @entity53 is completely dedicated to @entity11			1
we have stands in the streets , paddocks in the harbor , and the configuration of the city is different because we close the roads			0
@entity7 is a completely different place			2
" the locals , known as @entity53 , are prepared to put up with a month or two of disruption because the grand prix is very good for business -- and , perhaps more importantly , for @entity53 's global brand			2
" the grand prix is one of the things that helps distinguish @entity53 from other @entity80 destinations and gives it an additional layer of glamor which its rivals lack , " @entity146 of @entity11 money told @entity0			1
" the race keeps the principality in the public eye , which in turn attracts tourists and business conventions			2
the race itself directly brings around $ 120 million into the principality , with the bordering towns , such as @entity164 in @entity165 and @entity166 in @entity167 , taking a total of $ 12 million annually			2
" kissing the barriers for businesses like @entity106 's five - star hotel , the allure of the grand prix adds extra cache for its clients all - year - round -- and the race weekend enables it to raise its prices , with a four - day package starting at $ 10,400			0
the @entity13 -- the brainchild of local @entity181 and first run in 1929 -- is also important to the global money - making juggernaut that is @entity11			1
while other countries have spent millions and millions of dollars on new circuits in @entity188 and @entity189 , @entity190 , for example , the @entity53 race is so intrinsic to the image of @entity11 that race organizers the @entity82 have a special arrangement with the sport 's promoters			1
" @entity53 is the only race on the calendar that does n't pay a race hosting fee to the @entity200 , " explained @entity146			1
" with some rival circuits paying more than $ 60 million , it 's a big saving			0
@entity203 back in the fast lane " @entity53 's history and glamor make it a very important part of the @entity11 calendar			1
the race is well - known around the world and is a magnet to the rich and famous			0
this is great publicity for @entity11 and also means that there are many potential sponsors and investors in attendance , making it a once - a - year opportunity for @entity11 and the teams			2
" although money and glamor grease the wheels at the @entity13 , it does not necessarily follow that the event is a profitable enterprise for @entity226 's sovereign city - state			2
" the total budget for the race is around $ 35 million and the state provides a subsidy of $ 7 million towards this , " @entity146 added			0
" however , the cost of preparing the circuit for the grand prix means that even without paying a hosting fee the race rarely makes a profit			1
" with so much as stake at this weekend 's gp -- including the small matter of the 2013 drivers ' championship -- it also helps that the quality of racing around the streets of @entity7 remains undiminished			1
apart from modifications to improve safety , the two - mile loop through the narrow , winding streets , past the majestic casino , through the tunnel and along the harbor brimming with boats has presented the world 's fastest racers with the same rollercoaster challenge for the last 70 years			0
it is the slowest and shortest race on @entity11 's calendar but for many drivers it is the most thrilling			1
@entity262 's late triple world champion @entity261 -- winner of a record six @entity53 grands prix -- said he entered a trance - like state when racing on the limit between @entity7 's narrow barriers			1
" @entity53 is unlike any other racetrack in @entity11 , " said @entity6 , who triumphed there in 2009 on the way to winning the world title			1
" a qualifying lap around here is an exhilarating experience for a driver ; you turn into corners on the limit and you kiss every barrier at the exit			0
it 's a great challenge			0
" for the month of may , @entity53 hums with the rhythm of @entity11 , and the drivers , fans and @entity53 alike anticipate the high - octane pleasures to come at this race			1
" i was born in @entity53 and in my life i 've missed one grand prix , " recalled @entity106			0
" i was very sad when i missed it			0
" we are very proud			0
this is a legendary event and is really very important			0
it 's an atmosphere that you feel , an incredible excitement			0
as a @entity53 i also enjoy it very much			0

it takes two months to *transform* @entity7 into a racetrack for the @entity11 race
@entity53 residents like @entity9 driver @entity6 say the principality is normally peaceful
200,000 fans will come to @entity53 to watch the legendary @entity13
organizers of the race do not pay a race fee but the gp rarely makes a profit
