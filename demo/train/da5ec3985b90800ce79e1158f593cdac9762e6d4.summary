-- the @entity2 network has been lauded as lightning - fast			1
now , the company is launching a second phone that will work with its speeds			0
the @entity8 - built @entity7 launched on @entity2 on saturday , joining the @entity9 , @entity11 's flagship device			1
in our tests , the @entity9 delivered some of the highest data - transfer speeds we 've seen			0
but @entity2 's @entity16 recently went down across the country , which raises the question : is the company ready for another @entity2 phone ? for a period of more than 30 hours from april 26 through 28 , @entity2 customers experienced nationwide downtime on the company 's @entity25 network			1
those using @entity9 smartphones were the first to spot the problem , as they were only able to receive 3g or even 2g connections			0
since @entity2 only handles data transfer , voice and text messaging services were not affected			2
the @entity7 was originally slated for release the same weekend as the outage			1
@entity8 's addition to the @entity38 brand is only the second phone to run on @entity2 's @entity40 , giving those that do n't want to buy the @entity9 a bit of choice			1
aside from the manufacturer , however , the phones differ little in hardware specs			0
both have 4.3 - inch displays , front - and back - facing cameras with the same resolutions ( 1.3 and 8 megapixels , respectively ) , and the ability to act as a @entity2 mobile hotspot			1
but as the @entity2 network was still down the morning of april 28 , the phone 's release was pushed back			1
@entity2 acknowledged the downtime in a @entity59 status update , claiming it was " working with engineers " to get @entity61 back up to speed			2
by the second day , @entity2 restored 4g service in its areas of coverage			2
@entity2 has continually refused to explain the network outages			2
when @entity68 asked for specific reasons for why the network went down last month , a @entity2 spokesperson declined to answer			2
@entity2 data - transfer capability and coverage are a relatively new phenomenon			1
@entity74 launched the first @entity2 phone on its @entity77 network in june 2010 with @entity11 's @entity61			1
@entity2 's @entity40 debuted in december of last year			1
@entity78 and @entity79 both lay claim to the @entity2 moniker on their respective @entity82 + networks , though issues around what qualifies as " @entity2 " still remain			2
as of early may , @entity2 states 4g coverage is available in " 45 markets " across the @entity88			2
" our philosophy has always been the same , " said @entity2 spokesperson @entity89 in an interview			0
" when phones are ready to deliver customers an excellent experience , we 'll launch them			0
" but it looks like the hardware has been ready to go for a while			0
out of the 10 @entity100 @entity2 retailers @entity68 contacted , six said they already had @entity7 handsets in stock for some time , but were not able to sell them until today			1
( two stores did not answer , one had n't received phones , and one received its first shipment yesterday			0
) one store claims it received its shipment " about two weeks ago , " approximately the same time as @entity2 's @entity2 network outage			1
it 's a similar case in other parts of the country as well			0
a store in the @entity117 suburban area also had phones in stock , but has n't been able to sell them , according to a report from @entity122			0
two @entity2 employees from separate @entity100 stores told @entity68 the delay had to do with " @entity2 network problems			0
" speaking at a @entity128 business forum in @entity129 this week , executive director of @entity25 technologies @entity132 said the company had learned lessons from the experience , and that @entity2 was going to " make some adjustments			0
" @entity137 would n't elaborate any further			0
whatever adjustments the company has to make , we 'll have to wait and see how @entity2 's @entity40 handles the influx of new device activations			1
