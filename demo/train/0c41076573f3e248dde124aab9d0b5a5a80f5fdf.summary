-- when i was a child , a pale specter used to call our house most evenings , eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns			0
we called her the " @entity10 , " a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread			0
she was n't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread			0
no , she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision			0
although we all laughed at the time , it was with a bit of shifty - eyed shame			0
because most of us ( including if not particularly the illustrious @entity26 family ) have lurking within us our very own " @entity10 , " ready to convince us that each cough , sniffle and less - than - nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health			1
and , naturally , that @entity10 looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information			1
yup , so quoth @entity36 , we all have cancer			0
according to a recent report from the @entity40 , 80 % of internet users have looked up health information online			1
while that practice can be beneficial in some respects , the abundance of ( variably valid ) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs			1
( or , worse , can lead us to neglect getting the care we need			0
) read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health - care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online			1
searching blind your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall , twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair			0
you type " eye twitch " into @entity36 and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open , revealing to you wonders untold			0
you are the chosen one			0
too bad that this trove of " medical information " is actually some dude 's fan - fiction site			1
long wait at the doctor 's office ? blame the patients sure , the above is an extreme example , but , as dr. @entity77 of @entity78 pointed out , " there 's a lot of bad information on the @entity82 and information that can be dangerous			1
" especially if you 're not considering who put up that information in the first place			1
pho urges users to favor web addresses ending in			1
edu when looking for reputable health - care info , and to check who is funding the collection of that information			1
" there 's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the @entity82 , " he said			1
he suggests turning to sites like @entity101 as well as troves of information curated by doctors ( like @entity87 's own website ) when trolling the web for info			1
and , of course , if a site mentions trolls and third eyes , one should definitely press on			0
flailing in forums if there 's one thing people like to do online , it 's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies ' various and sundry discharges			1
and , it seems , we 're pretty interested in reading about the health issues of others , too			1
according to that @entity40 study , 23 % of social - network users have followed a friend 's health experiences online , and 34 % of internet users have read about someone else 's medical issues on newsgroups , websites or blogs			1
that 's all well and good ; sharing experiences with others is enriching ! unless the people you 're sharing with are idiots			1
case in point : here 's a @entity143 thread in which folks are discussing whether you can make a pregnancy test out of bleach and @entity148 ( spoiler alert : you ca n't			2
) " you can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really is n't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close , " warned @entity150 , co-founder of symptom - checker app @entity151 and fourth - year medical student at @entity154			0
on the other hand , " sometimes you 'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem , and their solution does help			0
" doctor - turned - kayaker fights malaria in @entity168 " health - care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms , " added dr. @entity169 of @entity170 " i think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community			1
" the trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you			2
and , you know , if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach , maybe click off and see a doc. getting emotional you know that game " 6 degrees of @entity198 " ? there should seriously be a version of that called " 6 @entity202 " -- as in , when looking up your symptoms online , how long does it take to deduce that you have a life - threatening disease instead of , say , a simple cold ? according to @entity169 , the root of this whole " worst - case scenario " thing is getting too emotional			2
" for most intents and purposes , when you 're looking for online health information , it 's about yourself or a family member , " she said			1
" when you 're looking through that lens , it 's very hard to keep emotional distance			2
so you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that 's the path you 'll continue down , whether it 's correct or not			2
" @entity169 suggested using online symptom checkers simply to " understand possible diagnoses , find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home			2
" @entity151 and @entity101 's symptom checker let you type in what you 're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor 's aid			1
your doctor 's website might also have such a tool			2
@entity240 , you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees			0
keeping mum around @entity246 " i think , traditionally , many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the @entity252 , " @entity77 said			0
" but i think more and more doctors are accepting it			2
personally , i think that transparency of information is helpful in a way			2
" translation : help your doctor help you			0
if you 're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what 's ailing you , share that info with your physician			1
" i really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online , because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns , " @entity169 said			1
" people get scared when they get sick and hurt , and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves			2
the @entity252 adds to that physician 's expertise in order to do that			2
" study : fainting may have genetic link pho suggests using tracking apps ( @entity285 and @entity286 are a few examples ) to keep tabs on blood pressure , weight , heart rate and other areas that are of particular concern to you and your @entity295			0
" these apps and sites give patients so much data about themselves that they never had before , " he said			2
and a log is useful to your doctor , who can scan for abnormalities and patterns that you may have missed			0
remember , though , knowing how to use the @entity252 does n't make you a doctor			0
@entity36 does n't count as a second opinion			0
if you 're unhappy with your doc 's diagnosis , go get one the traditional way			0
putting off the inevitable if your ailment is n't going away , all the symptom - checking and @entity101 - ing in the world is n't going to help you			1
make a doctor 's appointment			0
sites like @entity319 make it super easy ( and free ; doctors pay to be listed ) to set up an appointment asap , so no whining that you 'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then " it " will have gone away			1
unless , of course , " it " is that white bread you just ate			0
in that case , please stop calling my dad .			0

according to a @entity40 report , 80 % of internet users have looked up health info online
sites like @entity101 and others curated by doctors are safer
it 's better to be *cautious* in online forums of *non-experts*
internet information does not *replace* a second opinion
