-- they say there are no stupid questions -- or are there ? how about , " do you speak @entity6 ? " or , " what is @entity6 's flag ? " yes , these are quite ludicrous			1
tired of regularly having to answer questions like these , a group of @entity12 - based @entity6 students has launched a photo campaign in a bid to dispel misconceptions about their continent			1
called " @entity19 : fight the stereotype , " the social media initiative aims to educate and raise awareness about the common stereotypes surrounding @entity6 and its people -- misunderstandings like @entity6 being a homogenous entity rather than a diverse continent of more than 50 countries			2
the campaign features striking images of the members of the @entity32 of @entity34 's @entity33 wrapped in different @entity6 flags or holding them proudly			1
" what we wanted to do was embrace the individual flags of the countries of @entity6 , " says @entity36 , head of @entity37 for the organization			2
" we wanted to show the beauty and the power of the flag			0
we also wanted to break one of the biggest misconceptions about the continent , which is that @entity6 is a country , " she adds			1
for each photograph , the posing students , aged 18 to 21 , were also asked to come up with simple but powerful quotes that would disprove the ignorant and offensive remarks they would often hear			2
as a result , the images boast statements like " @entity6 do not all look alike , " " @entity6 do n't need to be saved , " " @entity6 is not a country " and " @entity6 is not a land filled with diseases			1
" in addition , the campaign is saturated with educational facts that are designed to strengthen the students ' quotes -- " i do n't speak ' @entity6 ' because ' @entity6 ' is not a language " says one student , his declaration accompanied by the fact that " there are an estimated 2,000 languages spoken in @entity6			1
" " we wanted to give facts , to correct , to give knowledge , " says @entity36 , " trying to educate and stop people from saying these other things			0
" the @entity32 of @entity33 first posted their photo campaign on @entity0 's @entity78 platform on january 20			0
since then , some 5,000 people have viewed the photos and more than 2,000 have shared them on @entity81			0
" the simplest actions can create awareness and we are hoping to do this not only campus - wide , but also world - wide , " says @entity36			0
