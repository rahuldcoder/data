on the same day that thousands of women stood up to participate in @entity3 , billed as the largest mass action to stop violence against women and girls , the sad news came from @entity8 that yet another woman was killed			1
the reason we took notice of 30 - year - old @entity14 's death among so many others killed every day is the shocking news that the man charged with killing her , her boyfriend , is none other than @entity21 , the athlete known as " @entity21 , " a double amputee whose @entity24 feats on prosthetic carbon fiber legs made him an international superstar			1
we do n't know what the investigation will uncover , but @entity14 's life is now lost			1
coincidentally , the @entity21 case happens around @entity31 , the date that rising activists marked to bring focus on the crisis of violence against women			1
@entity37 's bullet ad with @entity21 backfires brutal attacks against girls and women have stirred the world 's conscience with increasing frequency in recent months			1
there is no question that many societies are finally becoming fed up with the much - too - common practice of attacking , raping and killing women that goes on in all corners of the world			2
the perpetrators of these crimes are invariably cowards , using superior physical force to intimidate or exert power			0
we have come to know some of their victims			0
remember @entity59 , the @entity60 girl targeted by the @entity61 because she proclaimed that every girl has a right to an education			1
she has survived and vowed to continue her struggle despite the @entity61 's promise they will try to kill her			0
the contrast in courage could not be starker			0
then there is @entity71 , the @entity72 university student who was gang raped in a bus			1
she died of her horrific injuries , but her assault moved @entity77 and the entire world so deeply that her legacy has fueled the battle to stop this violence			1
earlier this month , in a case gruesomely reminiscent of @entity71 , 17 - year - old @entity82 was raped , mutilated and left for dead , in the @entity8 city of @entity85			1
just as @entity59 has inspired girls to demand an education , @entity71 has awakened @entity77 to the need for better laws and law enforcement to protect women			1
and , until the authorities get their act together , fierce @entity77 girls are learning self - defense			0
no wonder the @entity3 celebrations have been such a hit all over @entity77			0
organizers say " @entity101 " are taking place in 203 countries			2
if true , that means women in a majority of countries on @entity106 could heed the call to stand , and to dance			2
yes , to dance as a sign of " solidarity , purpose and energy " to " shake the world			0
" a global push to end violence with song and dance amid the celebration , however , it 's important to keep in mind what the occasion marks			2
according to @entity124 statistics , one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime , including beating , rape or assault , making such violence a more prevalent problem than @entity132 , malaria or any other disease			1
it means 1 billion women alive at this moment will become part of that statistic , hence the @entity3			1
women used to keep their assaults quiet , out of shame or fear of being ostracized			2
there 's @entity144 , the @entity145 correspondent attacked by thugs in @entity148 's @entity147 while covering the @entity150 revolution , one of countless women assaulted in @entity150 by gangs of men			0
some female democracy protesters , fighting for their rights , were later subjected to " virginity tests " by the @entity150 military			0
the problem has deep roots and far - reaching ramifications			0
women have endured the use of rape as a weapon of war , and domestic violence as a tool of control at home			1
domestic violence is one of those old traditions that should have died long ago			0
a 2012 study by @entity174 found most youngsters in @entity77 believe wife - beating is justified			0
but other surveys found the problem knows no national boundaries			0
the @entity124 says about 14,000 @entity181 women die every year from domestic violence			1
in some countries , women are subjected to violence as retaliation for other family members ' or their own perceived offenses in so - called " honor killings			2
" in war zones , fighters rape women to humiliate their enemies , to perpetrate " ethnic cleansing " and to force people to leave			2
an incredible 92 % of @entity197 women in one study said they had been raped in that country 's war			0
as you read this , women are being raped in @entity204 , in the @entity205 and in other countries where wars rage			0
after the violation , many of them will be rejected by their families			0
violence against women tends to go hand in hand with lack of equality			2
it also is a sign of a malfunctioning society			0
it is a stubborn problem , but one that responds to measures , such as those just approved after a perplexing political battle in the @entity224			0
as the world changes , as countries emerge from poverty and people fight for their rights , we can look to the level of violence against women as one of the gauges of their success			1
the @entity236 of 2002 and 2005 said the low status of women is one of the reasons @entity242 countries had stagnated , calling the rise of women " a prerequisite for an @entity242 renaissance			0
" @entity21 ' @entity8 , a country with a storied history in the fight for racial equality , has a disturbing record of violence against women			1
around the world , the awareness and determination of women to stand up to violence are a major step forward			1
but tragedies such as the killing of @entity14 in @entity8 , one of countless occurring just today , are a reminder of the urgency of the cause			1
any country , any society that wants to move forward and earn a place of honor among the nations must make it a priority to teach men from the earliest age that violence against women in any form is unacceptable , and those who hurt or intimidate women should be punished .			2

one billion rising mass action is raising awareness of violence against women
