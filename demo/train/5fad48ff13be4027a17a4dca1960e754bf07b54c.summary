there is a dark duality about the @entity2			1
majestic and macabre , the bridge is an architectural wonder that also happens to be a magnet for suicides			2
it is the most - used suicide spot in the @entity8 , second in the world			1
" people come from all over the world to go onto this bridge , " said sergeant @entity10 , a retired police officer who used to patrol the @entity11			1
" not just to sight - see , but also to take their life			2
" on friday , @entity16 's @entity2 board of directors unanimously approved $ 76 million in funding to erect a 20 - foot - wide steel net -- extending out from each side of the 1.7 - mile span -- to deter would - be jumpers			1
the federal government will cover $ 50 million of the cost ; the rest will come from state and local sources			0
last year , 46 people died after jumping off the @entity11 , according to the @entity28 , an organization dedicated to stopping suicides from the bridge			1
the organization estimates that more than 1,600 people have leapt to their deaths since the bridge opened in 1937			1
" where nets have been erected as suicide barriers they 've proven to be 100 % effective thus far , " said @entity34 , ceo and general manager of the @entity36 , which presented the proposal to the board			1
" suicidal people have stopped jumping at those locations			1
" those locations include the @entity45 in @entity46 and the @entity47 in @entity48 , where , after barriers were installed , suicide rates went down dramatically			2
" apparently , suicidal individuals do n't want to hurt themselves , they want to die , " said @entity34			0
" so where nets have been erected , people stop jumping			1
" the decision to move forward with the @entity11 plan punctuates a contentious fight that has simmered here for decades			2
on one side of the debate were those who believe a suicide barrier will detract from the bridge 's beauty			1
on the other side were mental health and other advocates , some of whom bore an intimate sense of the potential benefits of such a barrier			2
one of the barrier proponents is @entity74			2
he stood on the precipice of the @entity2 on a cold afternoon in march 2005			1
he was unemployed , drowning in a sea of medical bills , and distraught			0
" i was hurting a lot , " said @entity74			0
" i was dealing with a lot of issues , and i felt like i was dealing with them by myself			0
" almost as soon as he hopped over the 4 - foot barrier ( which many argued makes jumping too easy ) to the bridge 's outer railing , he was approached by @entity85			1
@entity10 had been there before			0
during his 23 - year career , he coaxed more than 200 people back from that same railing			1
two people he was n't able to save			2
" when someone goes over on the other side of that rail , it 's like having a gun to their head , their finger on the trigger , and the hammer pulled back , " said @entity10 , founder of @entity91 , a crisis management and suicide prevention organization			2
" they 're ready to go			0
the pain is great -- they see no hope			0
" for more than 90 minutes , @entity10 listened while @entity74 talked , the biting wind swirling around them			0
as the minutes passed , @entity74 says the burdens he was carrying slowly lifted			0
eventually he decided to come back over the barrier			0
" i knew things would get 10 times worse when i came back over , but i wanted to give it another shot , " said @entity74 , who says it took another eight years to get help for his mental health problems			0
opposition faded a few years ago , the transportation district invited public comment about installing a suicide barrier , said @entity34 , the transportation district head , and opinion was deeply divided			1
" leave the bridge alone , " one commenter posted			0
" it 's not the bridge 's fault people choose to commit suicide there			1
" another commenter echoed a common perception about how effective a barrier could be : " sadly , desperate people do commit suicide and they will find another means to do it if the @entity11 bridge is not available to them			1
" an artist 's rendering from the proposal shows a horizontal barrier that extends from the deck , beneath the roadway , and does n't clash with the bridge 's unique @entity147 hue			2
feds boosting mental health access , treatment @entity74 said a suicide net certainly would have discouraged him from considering jumping , that his attraction to the bridge was the ease with which he could perish			1
very rarely do people who are stopped from jumping go on to commit suicide , according to a study published in 1978 by @entity160 , a researcher at the @entity161			1
more than 90 % of would - be jumpers who were stopped , according to the oft - cited study , were still alive decades later			0
@entity74 and @entity10 say the decision to fund a barrier is overdue			0
" it should have been there a long time ago , " said @entity74			0
" a lot of lives could have been saved			0
" @entity10 says that the father of a young man who died after jumping off the @entity2 summed it up potently for him			1
" a view or a life ? a view or a life ? " said @entity10 , paraphrasing the father			0
those few words were what he says convinced him that something needed to be done			0
when asked about advocates ' argument that lives have been lost needlessly during the years the transportation group assembled its plan , @entity34 said , " with the passage of time i think society 's values and understanding of suicide has evolved , and so has our board 's			1
" it will be several years before the net is built , said @entity34			0
still , a plan in motion -- even if it takes some time -- is of great solace to advocates			0
" ( it has been ) 77 years of needless deaths and survivor family devastation , " @entity201 , one of the rare people who survived a suicide attempt from the bridge , said before the board 's vote			1
he said the move toward a safety barrier means the community at last is " placing higher value and worth on people 's lives over a piece of bright red iron			2
" how i learned to live after trying to end my life i was an accomplice to my brother 's suicide			0
