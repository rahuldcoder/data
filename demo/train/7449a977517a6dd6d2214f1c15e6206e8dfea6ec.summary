-- in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in northern @entity3 , a @entity5 - inspired garden with mini-waterfalls welcomes potential buyers to a newly built luxury apartment			1
the four bedroom , four bathroom unit boasts marble floors , a state of the art open kitchen , computerized lighting systems and amenities that rival five star hotels			0
it 's an apartment so posh visitors are required to wear sanitary shoe covers			2
with a market value close to $ 3.5 million , the need for guests to tread carefully is understandable			0
" in my opinion it 's worth it , " says real estate agent @entity24			2
" it 's one of the best apartments in @entity3			1
an exceptional building designed by the best developer in the city			0
" but for the past year this swanky home has sat empty without a buyer -- half the other units in the six - floor block are empty , too			0
so are tens of thousands of other apartments throughout @entity3 , all for sale but sitting vacant without buyers			1
" right now we have a lot of apartments that are not sold and sitting empty because of high prices , " says @entity24			2
housing prices in @entity3 soared beginning in 2012 , soon after western powers imposed the toughest round of economic sanctions against @entity48 to curb its disputed nuclear program			1
the sanctions were a huge blow to @entity48 's economy and when the value of @entity48 currency took a nose dive and no one could figure out where the economy was going , many here poured their money into real estate			1
according to political analyst , @entity67 , " real estate became the best way to protect your money			0
" @entity24 agrees with this sentiment			0
" this is the safest investment you can make today , " she said			0
" real estate has always increased in value			0
we have one apartment that 's increased roughly $ 1,000 per square meter in the past five months			0
" if someone wants to invest in @entity3 and knows what he 's buying , it 's almost ( a ) certainty that 's a good investment			2
" but with @entity48 's economic future still looking hard to predict and many @entity48 lacking buying power , the market is at a standstill -- sellers not selling because they 're hoping prices go up			1
buyers are not buying because they 're hoping prices go down			1
the outcome is a @entity3 skyline full of empty apartments -- and investors still looking to buy and build despite very little demand			1
" sometimes you wonder how can people possibly build more apartments when nothing is selling , " said @entity24			0
but remarkably , it 's happening in @entity3 because until the economy improves and housing prices start to stabilize , they believe , real estate is the safest place to invest .			1

luxury apartments in @entity3 are lying empty despite investors looking to buy
@entity48 's economy has been heavily *affected* by *international* sanctions
buyers are hoping prices go down and sellers are hoping prices go up
