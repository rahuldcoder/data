-- under the baking hot skies of the @entity4 the region 's travel hubs are showing they 're not just places to change planes -- they 're destinations in their own right			1
the @entity4 's " @entity9 " carriers -- @entity11 - based @entity10 , @entity13 's @entity12 , and @entity15 - based @entity14 -- have grown dramatically over the last decade , opening new routes and competing with the biggest names in aviation			1
conveniently placed between east and west , the @entity4 's geographic location has been a major factor in these industry - reshaping developments			1
anywhere in the world is one stop from the @entity4			1
add to this the investment in state - of - the - art airports and vast new plane fleets , as well as the acquisition of stakes in some of @entity33 's biggest airlines which have ruptured traditional airline alliances , and it is clear why more and more commercial traffic is making a pit - stop in the region			1
watch video : ' @entity40 ' shake up global aviation but the " @entity9 " are keen to stress that @entity13 , @entity42 and @entity11 are more than just strategically located landing strips in the desert			1
each is a thriving commercial and cultural destination with plenty to offer travelers passing through the region			1
@entity11 literally built out of the sand , @entity11 set out on its meteoric rise into the global community in the early 1970s			2
in just three decades it grew from a humble fishing and trading dock into a world - renowned tax - free business haven			2
with artificial islands , gaudy luxury hotels and colossal skyscrapers , modern @entity11 is nothing if not spectacular			2
and according to @entity10 president @entity61 , @entity11 is more than just a transfer hub			1
" @entity11 is such a great place to live and work , have your family , have education , health , etc. the lifestyle is very good , " @entity61 told @entity0 's @entity63			2
" remember , we have nearly 80,000 hotel rooms here , which is a lot more than most large cities in the world today , " he added			2

where to stay : @entity11 may have a huge number of hotels but few are more impressive than the sail - shaped @entity90 , which offers jacuzzis in every suite , an army of trained butlers and guest access to a fleet of chauffeur - driven @entity98 cars			2
@entity13 like @entity11 , downtown @entity13 has its fair share of large mirror - and - glass buildings that stretch high into the sky			0
unlike its upstart neighbor , however , the emirate is eager to emphasize its cultural and traditional heritage alongside its shiny modern facade			0

where to stay : built in 2005 , the @entity129 is located on a private beach			0
despite its youth , the 114 domes that grace the opulent hotel evoke traditional @entity136 architecture			0
@entity15 unlike @entity11 and @entity13 , the @entity42 capital of @entity15 has less experience when it comes to welcoming foreign tourists and travelers			1
this situation will change dramatically in the coming years as the tiny nation prepares to host the football extravaganza of the @entity145			0
a detailed plan is already in place to develop tourism in @entity42 , although the ceo of @entity14 , @entity150 , is keen for the country to maintain its cultural integrity			1
" we do n't want to be a mass - tourism destination , we want to be very selective , " he told @entity153			0
" we have a lot of culture in this country , the people 's mindset is different			0
we want to respect that mindset ... and grow our tourism in a way that does not dispute the cultural fabric of my country			0
