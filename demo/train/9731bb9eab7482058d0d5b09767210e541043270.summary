-- " @entity1 : @entity5 " is one of the most talked about games in 2011 and highly anticipated games for 2012			1
with a combination of fantastic art direction , immersive gameplay and deep storyline , the third installment in the franchise has attracted attention from gamers and nongamers alike			2
the series is the brainchild of creator and game designer @entity17			1
@entity17 , 45 , has been working in the gaming industry since 1995 and had early success with " @entity21 " and " thief			1
" but it 's his more recent work in the creation and development of " @entity1 " and " @entity26 " that has garnered the most attention			1
in an interview for @entity0 , @entity17 talked about where he gets his inspiration for his games , growing up nerdy and being a self - proclaimed " media whore			1
" inspiration for games @entity17 did n't start his career in gaming			1
during his college days , he turned his creative talents to writing plays			2
while working on his craft and worrying about his post-college years , @entity17 sought out the advice of playwright @entity42			1
@entity42 , @entity17 said , taught him about the business side of writing and dealing with agents			1
so when an agent asked to turn a play @entity17 had written into a screenplay , he had his opening into the movie industry			1
but @entity17 ended up only selling one screenplay to @entity51 and did n't like what he learned about having to write commercially , instead of strictly creatively , and how tough it was to be one of the legions of screenwriters in @entity57			1
he began to " tool around doing different things " for the next seven years and was struggling to figure out what he was going to do			2
eventually , his attention turned to something he loved doing as a child : playing games			1
" all of a sudden it occurred to me that there are actually people who make these , " @entity17 said			1
" could i become one of these people ? i started looking at gaming magazines for ads from the game industry and i just tuned into ( the job ) ' game designer ' primarily because i knew i could n't draw , i could n't program ... so what was i going to do ? " @entity17 was hired by @entity76 and was ready to unleash his creative talents in the gaming world			1
he was particularly focused on creating unique and interesting worlds and allowing players to move freely through them ( a unique concept at the time )			2
he worked on the writing and design of 1998 's " thief : the @entity87			1
" " i 'm not certain how the writing fell on me , but it did			0
they knew i could write and it sort of fell to me , " @entity17 said			1
" i was able to bring an understanding of artistry and structure from when i was writing plays and in movies			0
" " thief " was @entity76 ' most successful title in sales and critical acclaim			2
but @entity17 was looking for a new challenge and joined two others in forming @entity103 in 1997			1
he jumped at the opportunity to work on " @entity21 " as game designer after playing ( and enjoying ) " @entity106			1
" " i felt it was a real step forward in launching the gamer into a real environment that felt true , " he said			0
" i also loved the feel of the characters -- that they felt like they were written in a naturalistic style			0
" they were just people and you found all these diaries of the people			0
it played out like some sort of novel			0
it has a natural , believable feel to it			0
" it was during this time that @entity17 began to hone his skills for telling a creative and interesting story while still making it interactive for the player			1
" how do you get to those levels of interaction so they feel natural and exciting ? and anticipate what the player is going to do -- that 's always a challenge , " he said			2
" @entity21 " was n't a commercial success , but it drew attention from critics for its forward - looking approach to how games should be played			1
@entity17 and his team began to build a culture of intellectual curiosity at their studio as a way of inspiring ideas and concepts for their games			1
in 2002 , that free flow of ideas gave rise to the " @entity1 " franchise			1
@entity17 said " @entity1 " and " @entity26 " are noted for their incorporation of historical philosophy and architecture movements -- inspired , he says , by a " nerdity that is pretty far - reaching and broad at the company			1
" " we 'll start up these conversations about the @entity163 or conversations about politics or about @entity167 history or conversations about social movements			0
and because we are a bunch of industry and culture and social movement nerds in the company , we are fascinated by all these activities , " he said			0
" we nerd out on a very broad range of things and we bring those things to our games			1
" for " @entity1 : @entity5 , " @entity17 said , he tried to form a complete social perspective on the period in which the game takes place			1
a @entity185 documentary called " @entity186 " served as the launching point for the upcoming game 's themes of optimism and anarchy			2
the game is set in the @entity167 in 1912 , a time between the @entity193 and @entity194 i. it was also a time of great technological leaps that @entity17 said gave people an incredible sense of optimism			1
" you have , in the last 30 years of our lives , one major piece of technology and that 's been the internet			2
if you go back to 1912 , they had , like , 10 different things on the scale of the @entity205 , " @entity17 said			1
" they had electricity , cars , movies , records , airplanes , radio in a period of about 10 or 20 years			0
their heads must have been absolutely spinning			0
" it was also a time of great upheaval			0
an anarchist shot and killed president @entity223 in 1901 and an anarchist would assassinate archduke @entity225 of @entity226 in 1914			0
a book entitled " @entity228 in the @entity229 " detailed @entity167 's first documented serial killer who stalked the 1912 @entity163 in @entity231 and caught @entity17 's attention			1
" in all these stories , you have these incredible themes			0
one of great optimism and excitement for the future and one of this ominous feeling at the same time , " @entity17 said			1
" this yin and this yang that was present in all of this research really made me excited to work on this game			0
" growing up a nerd @entity17 said he was a nerd when he was growing up -- and that it was n't the badge of honor that it can sometimes be today			1
he said he played " @entity252 " by himself in his family 's basement			2
he played war games from @entity254 , like " @entity255 " and " @entity256			2
" his first console was an @entity258 that he got on his birthday and was " one of the best moments of my life			0
" but he acknowledges that it was a lonely time			0
" by the definitions of the time , i was a nerd. , " he said			0
" i could n't help what i was			0
i could n't pretend to like things i did n't like			0
i hated it to some degree , because i was made fun of for it			0
now that i 'm grown up , i 'm not made fun of for it and it is sort of celebrated			0
" now , he points to events like the @entity277 convention , hosted by @entity278 , as a celebration of being a nerd			2
and people openly proclaiming to be a geek or a nerd is more evidence of the changing culture			2
" i 'm very happy that kids growing up now , it is very much more accepted , " @entity17 said			2
" ( they ) will not be made fun of because of what i went through as a kid			0
i 'm very happy about that			0
" " media whore " when diving into a project like " @entity1 : @entity5 , " @entity17 dives head first : researching everything he can about the time , the culture , the technology and the conflicts of his setting			1
he said he gets deeply invested in the concepts because he wants to be able to weave as complete a story as possible			0
@entity17 said he constantly reads and , with his @entity305 , he can read wherever he is			2
he is a self - proclaimed history nerd and , while he does n't read a lot of science fiction , was originally inspired by a book called " @entity310 , " which he said revealed quite a bit about unintended consequences to him , a running theme in the @entity1 franchise			1
" they were all excited about the colony on @entity317 because they thought they would leave all the problems of @entity321 behind -- racism , war , all that			0
what they forget is that on @entity317 they bring the problems with them because they bring the people with them , " he said			0
" things do n't always happen the way they are created to , whether it is @entity332 in ' @entity1 ' or @entity333 in ' @entity1 : @entity5			1
' " he also consumes other types of media voraciously and views it as part of his job because he needs to know what 's going on			2
" i 'm watching and re-watching ' @entity341			0
' i 'm watching and re-watching ' @entity342			0
' i read comic books			0
i 'm a huge media whore			0
" he said his appetite for media feeds his creativity for his projects			0
the more he reads and watches , the greater detail he can put in his games			2
critics and players consistently point to the attention to the littlest details in the " @entity1 " series as one of the standout elements in the franchise			2
@entity17 wants the players to feel as he would want to feel in the game 's time period , like they belong			1
" i want to feel like if i went back in time and i was there that i would n't be that confused or surprised by what i saw			0
that would be my goal			0
