-- @entity1 plays a slick @entity3 criminal defense attorney in the movie adaptation of @entity6 's legal thriller " @entity5 "			1
audiences are likely to have strong memories of the star as a perspiring @entity11 lawyer 15 years ago in the movie adaptation of @entity13 's legal thriller " @entity14			1
" those customers will be pleased to know that the guy still looks great arguing in a courtroom , still delivers his lines with a variable drawl implying barbecue for dinner			0
this time , @entity1 is @entity23 , who 's familiar to fans of @entity6 's best - selling detective novels as the half brother of the @entity28 's @entity27			1
@entity23 's an unorthodox smoothie : his '' office '' is the backseat of his chauffeured @entity32 , and his clients tend to be colorful bottom - of - the - deck types that character actors love			2
the lawyer 's newest client , though , is fancier goods			2
@entity39 ( @entity40 , his petulant lip telegraphing his attitude ) is the son of a rich family , and he 's been charged with attempted rape and murder			1
he swears innocence , but he may or may not be guilty			0
and his case bumps up against that of another former @entity51 client already wrongly convicted			0
the whole thing gets @entity23 's moral gyroscope whirling in a way that makes for good reading but not automatically compelling moviegoing			1
plot leaps that are fun on paper look generic on screen ; here 's another lawyer movie in which the characters are only as interesting as the actors playing them			2
at least director @entity65 gives them their space			0
among the draws : @entity70 ( in " @entity73 " hair ) as @entity23 's investigator ; @entity74 as a @entity75 who 's also @entity23 's ex-wife ; and @entity77 ( with more hair than on " @entity79 " ) in a small , swell role as a hard - ass homicide detective			0
