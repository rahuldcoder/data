-- " now we 'll never know whether @entity1 got whacked or not			1
" this , believe it or not , was how somebody on a social networking site greeted last night 's shocking news of @entity9 's death , at 51 , of a heart attack while vacationing in @entity11			1
the first thing you want to say to this is : really ? six years have passed since the last episode of " @entity16 " left the fate of its psychically damaged crime boss and suburban patriarch to speculation -- and you still want closure after all this time ? is that really the first thing you thought about after someone died so young , so unexpectedly ? on the one hand , this sounds at best shallow and at worst callous			0
it is true , of course , that @entity1 , one of the great characters in @entity30 television and folklore , was indeed the role of a lifetime , for which @entity9 was deservedly honored with multiple emmys , unanimous acclaim and the type of reverberating legacy that is rarer than awards or praise			1
( it may be somewhat premature to call this immortality , but we 'll see in another 30 years or so			0
) appreciation : @entity9 , a pure actor it is also true that in what turns out to have been a painfully brief time , @entity9 had also distinguished himself in many roles on stage and screen in which his gruff , bearish demeanor proved adaptable enough to play everything from a well - heeled @entity53 parent in the 2009 @entity55 production of " @entity56 " to the recalcitrant father of an aspiring rocker in " @entity59 , " last year 's movie - directorial debut of " @entity16 " creator @entity61			1
he could also veer into the offbeat with surprising results , making a poignant impression while giving wounded , anxious voice to one of the beasts in @entity69 's 2009 movie adaptation of " @entity70 , " a film i liked better than most of my fellow film critics did at the time			0
in last year 's " @entity74 " he made a deeper impression playing @entity77 director @entity76 than his relatively brief screen time would have suggested			0
it was the resume of the consummate character actor			1
and yet , it 's just possible that only an actor as versatile and magnetic as @entity9 could have rendered a character as complicated , forbidding and intimately familiar as @entity1 powerfully enough to have raised the bar for dramatic television			1
@entity61 set the table for his quirky crime series by giving his menacing main character a streak of emotional vulnerability so deep and wide that he needed psychotherapy to cope with the consequences of his actions -- and the often trauma - inducing behavior of his family members			0
@entity98 left his mark on @entity100 and for all the tough talk , squalid activities and violent reprisals endemic to his profession , @entity1 was also flummoxed by life as a well - heeled @entity100 businessman trying to get his daughter into a decent college , his son into a better ( less illicit ) line of work and his wife to accept his peccadillos and keep the household together while he tried to keep his motley troops in line and the authorities at bay			2
one minute he could scare you ( and his shrink ) with his flashes of intense anger ; the next minute he made you empathize with his obsessive fascination with the wildlife ( ducks , bears , etc. ) wandering into his spacious backyard			0
he was both a dedicated thug and a lost soul , a philandering sociopath who lugged his own unwieldy , twisted sense of propriety and honor			0
it was this tension between @entity136 's warring selves that , as much as any of the show 's other virtues , kept millions of viewers riveted to " @entity16 " for six seasons			0
it also broadened the possibilities for new dramatic series featuring lead characters with similarly conflicted morals and sordid deeds			2
in other words : without @entity1 , there would be no @entity149 of " @entity150 " ( created by " @entity16 " writer @entity151 ) or @entity152 of " @entity153			1
" from the mouth of @entity1 : best quotes and without @entity9 bringing his own intelligence , charisma and intuitive graces to @entity1 's portrayal , television might have been more resistant to the deeper , more complex drama that has catapulted the medium to being the main event in @entity30 popular culture			1
@entity9 , known among fellow actors and others for his generosity of spirit toward others , gave all of us a gift that will keep on giving for generations			2
the real regret , the awful , terrible knowledge that informed so many grief - stricken tributes online wednesday , is not that we 'll never know what happened to @entity1 at that last supper			2
it 's that we 'll never have a chance to see all the other wonderful gifts we would have received from the man who brought him to riveting , haunting life			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity186 : @entity9 helped elevate the medium of dramatic television
without an actor of his gifts , the character of @entity1 might not have worked , he says
@entity195 : complex , conflicted @entity1 paved the way for others such as @entity149
he says it 's *sad* that we wo *n't* get to see @entity9 make other dramatic *breakthroughs*
