@entity1 , @entity0 -- it is the middle of the night of @entity0 -- time not to sleep , but to hit the streets and rally , whether out of pride or defiance			1
@entity1 's @entity7 , the focal point of the 2011 popular revolution that led to the ouster of longtime president @entity11 , filled with protesters angry at the man elected to succeed him , @entity13			1
they vented , too , at the @entity15 , the @entity17 group shunted aside under @entity11 that 's now the most powerful political force in @entity0			1
a similarly spirited nighttime scene played out outside a @entity21 mosque about 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) to the east			0
the thousands of demonstrators gathered here , though , had a much different message : fervently backing @entity13 and the @entity15 he once led			1
more such rallies , representing both sides of the political spectrum , are expected elsewhere around the @entity30 nation later sunday			2
the state - run @entity33 news organization , for instance , noted that protests were in full swing early sunday in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 ; so many people came out in @entity42 that traffic almost came to a standstill			1

an @entity0 man died of a gunshot wound to the head , the health ministry said			2

@entity79 , a leftist former presidential candidate , said in a video message posted saturday that he and others challenging the @entity0 government " reject the violence ... and all the attacks on the ( offices ) of the @entity15 or their party			1
" " peace is our weapon , " @entity79 said			0
he urged his followers to continue their demonstrations nationwide , saying , " we are not fighting a rock , rather failing politics that do not meet the needs of the people			2
" " we unite and know that strength is in the people , " he said in the video posted on his @entity98 page			0
" we will be victorious , @entity101 willing			0
" accepted order vs. change military security forces are patrolling streets around @entity0 , in anticipation of rallies sunday and fearful of looting , attacks on political or government offices , and violence generally			1
@entity13 also met saturday with his ministers of interior and defense to review security plans , state - run @entity33 reported			1
nearly a week ago , defense minister @entity115 said the army would , if necessary , " prevent @entity0 from slipping into a dark tunnel of civil unrest and killing , sectarianism and the collapse of state institutions , " raising the specter of a return to the powerful role it played in domestic politics under @entity11			1
but @entity13 is not @entity11			2
those results should be respected , say his supporters , who have taken to the streets by the thousands , many of them chanting their protest slogan : " @entity135 legitimacy is a red line			0
" their show of support kicked off friday in @entity21 , a @entity1 neighborhood			0
@entity13 's opponents have responded with more large - scale rallies of their own , including a sit - in planned for in front of the presidential palace in @entity1			1

the opposition includes a coalition of liberals , moderates and pro-democracy advocates who have joined those calling for the military to take over government and restore law and order			2
@entity15 under fire since @entity13 took office , @entity0 's already sour economy has plummeted further as investors have pulled out of the country in droves and tourism has dropped			1
at the same time , crime in @entity0 has shot up , and some are calling for a return to the law and order they knew under @entity11 's autocratic rule , carried out with the iron hand of the military			1
@entity13 gave a speech this week highlighting his achievements during his first year in office			2
but opposition members said he did not address his shortcomings and called for snap presidential polls , a new government and constitutional amendments			0
the @entity15 , whose leaders included @entity13 before his election , has lost four members to violence in recent days			1
two people were shot dead thursday when armed men attacked @entity15 offices in @entity189 , @entity13 's hometown , spokesman @entity185 said			1
the gunmen were shouting " @entity192 " during the assault , he said			0
@entity193 called on authorities to uphold @entity0 ' right to peaceful assembly and protect protesters and bystanders from violence			1
" given the appalling track record in policing demonstrations , it is absolutely imperative that the @entity0 authorities issue very clear instructions to security forces to uphold protesters ' right to freedom of assembly and refrain from unnecessary or excessive force , " said @entity200 , @entity193 's @entity201 and @entity30 deputy director			1
" they should make clear that anyone responsible for arbitrary and abusive force will be brought to justice			0
" in the past year , about 80 people have been killed during protests and other political violence largely attributed to security forces , @entity193 said			2
" we 're looking at the situation with concern , " president @entity220 said saturday in @entity221 , @entity222			0
