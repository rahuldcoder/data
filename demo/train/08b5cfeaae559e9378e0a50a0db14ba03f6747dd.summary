-- @entity1 landed a record extending ninth @entity4 title this year and also reached the final of the @entity6			1
but typical for the @entity8 in recent campaigns , those grand slam accomplishments mingled with further health woes			1
looking back on his 2014 , it 's no wonder , then , that @entity1 utters : " too many things ( happened ) to be happy during " the whole year			1
" that 's part of my life , though			2
it 's happened a few times in my career			2
and in keeping with @entity1 's approach during his recovery from an avalanche of afflictions in the past , he vows to " keep working hard			1
" " now i have a month to prepare for the 2015 season , and that 's my goal , " the 28 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity26 in late november shortly before the groundbreaking ceremony of the @entity28 and @entity29			1
" i 'm going to work as much as i can , hope to be healthy for that			0
if i am healthy , i am confident that i can come back strong again			2
" @entity33 , a former top - five player who made the semifinals at the @entity35 and quarterfinals at @entity1 's beloved @entity4 in the 1980s , is n't about to disagree			1
" ever since he came onto the tour , he had all the markings of a guy that would be done with tennis by 26 , 27 , because his game was such a grind mentally and physically , " @entity33 , now a tennis analyst for several networks , told @entity0			0
" he 's obviously outlasted that age			0
he 's made of sterner stuff than most of us because he 's able to keep coming back from injuries and long layoffs and continues to dominate			1
" now , you get the sense that he 's going to be as always -- if he 's physically fit			0
if @entity1 's body might be giving him a few problems , his mind remains as strong as ever			1
it 's his psychological strength that sets him apart from the rest , according to @entity33			0
" i would say he 's the greatest mental player in the history of the sport			0
not strategy , necessarily , but the ability to play every point as if that 's the most important one you 've ever played , and do it every match			0
" @entity1 is a veteran at coming back , having been slowed by , most notably , injuries to both knees			1
however , this year saw the 14 - time grand slam champion miss a chunk of time due to a back problem , wrist complaint and appendix surgery , in that order			1
it all began at the @entity6 in january , when @entity1 hurt his back while warming up in the final against @entity78			1
holding a 12 - 0 record without conceding a set to the @entity82 heading into the contest , a hampered @entity1 fell in four sets with the ordeal leaving him in tears			1
recently he has undergone stem - cell treatment to aid his back after the same therapy , he said , helped his problematic , famous knees			2
the back bothered @entity1 , he added , throughout 2014			1
" i repeated the treatment that worked very well for my knees at the end of last year , so i am doing that for my back now and i hope i have a good success on that , " he said			2
when the wrist sidelined @entity1 at the @entity35 , it ensured another year he skipped a major -- the last time he contested all four in a season came in 2011			1
contrast his attendance with @entity102 -- the only man ahead of @entity1 on the grand slam ladder with 17 titles			1
the smooth @entity102 has appeared in 60 consecutive grand slams , a men 's record			2
@entity1 subsequently underwent appendix surgery in early november , ruling him out of the prestigious year - end championships in @entity110			1
" i started this year believing that i was ready for everything again , " said @entity1 , looking back to the start of 2014			1
" i started well , playing the final in @entity114 , but during the final i injured my back			0
it was hard for me to accept that i did n't have the chance to compete in the final , " he added , referring to his defeat by @entity78 in the opening slam of the season			2
" then i went down for a while			0
takes a little bit of time to recover from that mentally and physically			0
i was coming back to my best again ... playing better and better every single week and arriving in @entity125 with a great level			0
" then i won there and i was fully confident again			0
it was the most beautiful part of the year for me			0
" @entity130 's grass has n't been as pleasant for @entity1 since he nabbed the last of his two titles in 2010			2
hindered by his knees in 2012 and 2013 , he was on the receiving end of two of the biggest upsets in @entity130 history , exiting to @entity138 and @entity139 , respectively			0
in the most recent edition , @entity1 succumbed to fearless young @entity114 @entity141 , who seemingly could do no wrong on his serve in the fourth - round tussle			2
@entity141 struck 37 aces and was broken once			0
there was , though , a positive for @entity1			2
" i felt the knees were more comfortable playing there , " he said			0
" that 's important for me			0
" i loved that match , but i could n't win that match			0
that can happen on grass but i was proud the way that i played this year			0
" next year @entity1 's chances at @entity130 should increase , since an extra week features between the @entity4 and the year 's third grand slam			1
@entity1 is n't thinking yet about winning a 10th @entity4 or triumphing at @entity130 , more preoccupied with being ready -- and competitive -- for the @entity6 next month			1
@entity1 won the @entity6 in 2009 , but lately his memories of @entity157 presumably have n't been as upbeat			1
aside from his back issue versus @entity78 , he retired in 2010 , injured his hamstring in 2011 as he sought a fourth straight grand slam title -- or the ' @entity161 ' -- and lost the longest grand slam final in history in 2012 to @entity164			1
" my main goal today is try to put my body and my tennis again in a competitive way , " said @entity1			2
" that 's what i 'm going to try to do during this december			0
i am thinking i am ( focused ) about @entity114 because i like a lot of years in @entity114 , and i felt that i was doing the right things there so many years during my career			0
" i have a special motivation for that			0

this year was *bittersweet* for @entity1 , who won another major but suffered more injuries
@entity1 sustained back and wrist injuries before undergoing appendix surgery in november
the 14 - time grand slam winner says he is hoping to be healthy for the start of the 2015 season
@entity1 is putting an *emphasis* on the @entity6 , the year 's first major that starts next month
