" what 's going on with the tourists lately ? " that 's likely the question going through the minds of officials at @entity8 's @entity7 , which has experienced a string of nudity - related incidents this year			1
last friday , @entity12 tourists and sisters @entity14 and @entity15 were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at @entity18 temple , one of the sacred sites inside @entity8 's @entity7 complex			1

" as a @entity8 , it 's hurtful to my belief , and especially to the poor @entity8 saving up money to be able to come across the country to pray at @entity7			1
" @entity7 is a sacred site for all @entity8 and practicing @entity37 , worldwide			1

they received six - month suspended prison sentences , a one - million riel ( $ 250 ) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years			0

early last year , @entity89 officials deployed similar measures after a chain of " naked tourism " incidents at @entity94 , also a @entity58			0

" tourists should dress modestly in accordance with @entity8 customs and treat the sites respectfully			2
