-- of the eight " @entity4 " movies @entity3 made , there 's one in particular that sets his teeth on edge			1
the 25 - year - old actor , who portrayed @entity11 's adolescent wizard hero for 10 years starting at age 11 , admits to the @entity13 that it pains him to watch 2009 's " @entity4 and the @entity14			1
" " i 'm just not very good in it , " @entity3 bluntly told the @entity16 publication			2
my acting is very one - note and i can see i got complacent , and what i was trying to do just did n't come across			2
" it 's not that @entity3 is ungrateful for the experience			2
on the contrary , he calls the opportunity to play the globally adored character " an incredible blessing , because it gave me this opportunity to start a fantastic career			0
" but @entity3 was still getting started as an actor when he was cast in 2001 's first " @entity4 " film , meaning the franchise also holds " the moments i 'm not as proud of , " @entity3 said			1
" mistakes other actors get to make in rehearsal rooms or at drama school are all on film for everyone to see			0
" though admittedly self - critical , there is one " @entity4 " flick that @entity3 is happy with : " my best film is the fifth one , " he tells the @entity13 of 2007 's " @entity42 , " " because i can see a progression			1
" as he 's taken on more complex and varied roles in an effort to leave @entity4 behind , @entity3 has become more confident in his talent			1
in august , he stars in the romantic dramedy " @entity50 , " playing a character that 's " someone most like myself , " he told the @entity13			0
" i 'm definitely the geeky guy who wants to be in a relationship , " he said			0
" and it was a big thing for me to do a modern - day romance			0
there was no point in this film where i had to get covered in blood or cry over the body of someone or pull someone out of a muddy bog			0
" no more ' @entity4 ' films , @entity3 says			1

@entity3 is n't keen on the sixth film in the " @entity4 " franchise
he feels he 's " just not very good in it "
his *favorite* *installment* is the fifth film in the franchise
