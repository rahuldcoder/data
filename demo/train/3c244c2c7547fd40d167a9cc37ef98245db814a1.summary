while last year 's debacle has @entity22 's preparations in the spotlight , other parts of the @entity15 are bracing for worse weather in the next day or two			1
" we have a difficult task ahead of us over the next 24 hours			0
our crews will be out in force , and our primary focus initially will be on the interstate system			0
