@entity0 -- @entity8 's " top chef " is now the top chef in the @entity3 , and he wants you to eat at his restaurant -- no silver spoon required			2
@entity9 won the @entity10 at monday night 's @entity11 at @entity12 in @entity0			1
while he 's glad of the nod , he 's well aware that many people think it means his restaurants are now out of their league			2
@entity9 is the owner of @entity18 , @entity19 , the ' @entity21 sandwich chain , and the recently opened @entity23 , and host of the " top chef " program on @entity25			1
see list of @entity28 winners he and @entity31 's @entity30 winner , @entity29 of @entity33 's @entity32 , agree that while fine dining may be pricey -- it 's often roughly the cost of concert or sports tickets -- it 's also a chance to have the experience of a lifetime			1
and it 's their business to make diners feel welcome			0
" most of the better restaurants out there -- even if they 're high - end -- are usually not snobby and pretentious			1
it 's the restaurants that are trying to be like that that get it wrong ! the root of dining and hospitality is taking care of people , " @entity9 told @entity1			1
" people go to high - end restaurants and expect it to be snobby			1
they get their hackles up			0
they see a waiter talking to another waiter , sharing a joke , and think they 're being laughed at			2
that 's not the case			0
" " in @entity0 , [ waiters are ] writers , dancers and painters			0
they do n't have money to go to fine - dining fancy restaurants ! they 're not from some highfalutin ' background and going to look down at you			1
they 're working - class people -- like everyone in restaurants			1
" and while you 'll never leave his restaurants hungry , do n't go expecting to have to loosen your belt too much			1
but do " expect to be really taken care of			2
when food costs more , the restaurant can afford to have more staff on the floor			1
" " things you need to keep in mind going to an upscale restaurant are that the price you 're paying is not for a lot of food			1
it 's for high - quality food			1
it 's a very different dining experience than if you 're going to a chain restaurant where they 're piling it on			2
" " i was reading a book called ' @entity103 , ' which essentially said that too much food on a plate is wasteful and unappetizing and it 's the role of the chef to deliver the right portion of food			1
" @entity9 adds , " do a tiny bit of research			1
go online and see what they have to offer			0
if you 're intimidated by the menu , that 's when you really need to use the waiter			2
" his most important bit of advice for diners : " be nice			0
it goes a long way			0
you do n't need to palm a maitre d ' with a tip at the door to get a good table			1
if you walk up and say , ' this is a special occasion -- my wife and i are having our first anniversary , ' they 'll take care of you			0
" at @entity33 's @entity32 -- which was ranked in 7th place on a recently released list of the world 's top 50 restaurants -- diners will never have to wonder if they 're using the right salad fork -- or any fork at all			1
chef @entity29 is known for serving highly inventive dishes involving elements like scented air , temperature contrasts and custom - made utensils that sometimes require eating instructions from the wait staff , and he 's well aware that many diners are outside of their comfort zone			1
" because of the nature of the cuisine -- it being challenging because of the manipulations of ingredients and the way it 's presented -- we have to counteract that with very approachable service , " he told @entity1			2
" unlike a lot of four - star restaurants in the past that [ have ] scripts for describing the dishes and everyone has to cut their hair the same -- all the connotations of the snooty @entity169 waiter -- we intentionally abandoned			2
we encourage our staff to let their personality shine through , because that 's real hospitality			2
it 's about making people feel comfortable and welcome			0
" @entity29 is aware that he 's likely to encounter skeptics with his unusual approach to dining , but he and his staff are up to the challenge			1
" some people walk through the door , ready to let us take them on a journey			0
with some people , it takes a course or two to build up that trust -- through the food or the service team letting them know it 's ok to laugh out loud			0
it 's ok to giggle and smile , " he said			0
blogs and websites abound with stories of patrons weeping , moaning and screaming with surprise and delight most nights of the week			0
his advice to diners : come with an open mind			0
and he 'll do his part to help			0
said @entity29 , " when we opened nearly five years ago , there was so much hype and buzz and people saying they were worried they were n't going to ' get it			1
' we decided to combat that			0
" " the very first bite that everyone had was , literally , peanut butter and jelly			0
we 're going to give you something everyone had at some point in their life			0
it does n't look anything like a peanut butter and jelly , but it will taste like one			0
that 's going to set the tone , and people are going to laugh , and everything is ok after that			0
in a way we were making fun of ourselves			0
" and if the chef and staff can have a ball , so can the customers			2
you 're here to have a good time			1
