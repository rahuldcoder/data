-- the names on the formal , state - government - erected memorial signs by the sides of @entity6 highways are not famous to the outside world			1
but once you know the story behind them , you understand completely			0
you look at those signs and you offer a silent word of thanks			2
usually stretches of highways around the country are named for politicians , or for renowned figures from @entity21 history , or perhaps for singing stars or athletes or @entity25 actors who were born in the area			1
for the last several years , though , whenever i 've been in @entity6 i have noticed the highway signs with the unfamiliar names			1
last week i got in touch with the @entity31 to ask about them			0
the answer makes you want to pause humbly			0
on august 31 , 2009 , marine lance cpl. @entity34 , of @entity35 , @entity6 , was killed in an explosion while serving in @entity37 , @entity38			1
he was 31 ; he worked at a @entity40 assembly plant back home before joining the @entity42			0
in most cases of fallen service members , there is a solemn funeral ceremony when their remains are returned home , and a respectful obituary in the local newspaper			0
it can feel all too fleeting			0
but in @entity6 , in recent years , there has been an effort to do more			1
which is why the @entity56 authorized that a stretch of state route 2 in @entity59 -- @entity61 's home county -- be named , now and forever , to honor him			1
" after the @entity56 votes to name a portion of a highway , we manufacture the signs and put them up at the designated places , " said @entity62 , a spokesman for the @entity31			1
he said that two signs are usually erected , each facing a different direction , so that people in cars on either side of the highway will see the honoree 's name			1
always , the memorial signs are placed in the service member 's hometown or home county , so that friends and family members are reminded every day that the state and its citizens want to remember and salute him or her			1
thus , army master sgt. @entity88 's portion of @entity90 runs through @entity91 , @entity6			1
that is where he lived ; he was 44 when , on april 4 , 2012 , he died of wounds caused by an improvised explosive device in @entity38			0
he was a long way from home , but back in @entity91 now his old neighbors and buddies see his name and think of him each time they pull onto that part of the interstate			0
in the @entity21 , there has grown to be a mercenary ritual around so - called naming rights			0
if there 's a @entity108 , an @entity110 or @entity111 arena , or an @entity113 stadium , corporations line up to bid for the opportunity to plaster their names on it			1
airlines , financial services companies , big merchandisers -- all they have to do to get their names on the signs is come up with tens of millions of dollars			2
but the people with their names on the signs by the sides of @entity6 's highways have paid a much , much higher price , for much less selfish reasons			1
and they are so deserving of the honor , which ca n't begin to repay the sacrifice they made			0
the most poignant thing about the placement of the signs is that almost invariably they are next to spans of road upon which the service members , when they were younger , drove their own cars : on the way to movies , on the way to dances , on the way to grab late - night burgers with their best hometown friends			2
back then , they never could have imagined that the roads would before long bear their names , or why			0
but , while most of the rest of us during this last decade enjoyed life , or complained about it , inside @entity21 's borders , they crossed the oceans because their country said that it mattered			2
they did n't argue the politics of it			0
thus , on this @entity165 weekend , there is a bit of highway near @entity168 , @entity6 , set aside for @entity42 pvt. @entity169 , 19 , who died in combat in @entity171 in 2006 ; on @entity173 in @entity174 and @entity176 counties there is a road for @entity179 1st lt. @entity178 , 25 , who died in @entity171 in 2007 ; in @entity180 is @entity179 cpl. @entity182 's road , named for the 22 - year - old who died when an @entity184 detonated in @entity171 in 2007 ; on @entity185 in @entity186 is the portion of road for @entity179 chief warrant officer 2 @entity189 , 28 , who died in a helicopter crash in @entity38 in 2011 ; on @entity191 in @entity192 is the road honoring @entity42 @entity195 @entity194 , 22 , killed in combat in @entity171 in 2005 ; near @entity197 , on @entity185 73 , is @entity179 sgt. @entity199 's road , honoring a hometown young man who was only 21 when he died during an attack in @entity171 in 2003			1
the @entity31 's @entity62 told me that , because the authorizations from the @entity56 are sent over at widely spaced intervals , he did not have a readily available number of how many @entity6 service members in @entity21 's recent wars have had portions of highways named for them			1
reporter @entity211 of the @entity212 calculated that , as of last year , more than 70 @entity213 killed in the line of duty during the past decade had received the honor			2
almost certainly there will be more ; almost certainly the last highway sign has not been erected			2
but summer will be here soon			0
in @entity6 , that is the time when long , leisurely drives along wide roads and narrow strips of blacktop can feel the most enticing			2
the sun is high in the sky ; the nights are warm and lit by impossibly white stars			0
for those who left home never to return , those who once knew these highways by heart , the roads are now eternally theirs			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			2

@entity236 : in @entity6 , highway signs memorialize **soldier*s* *felled* in recent wars
he says the @entity56 authorizes the signs ; about 70 erected so far
he says the signs for *soldier* 's named are on highways near their hometowns
@entity236 : corporations pay millions to be named on signs ; these **soldier*s* paid dearer price
