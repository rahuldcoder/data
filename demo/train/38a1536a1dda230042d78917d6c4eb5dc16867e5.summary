-- the family of a woman whose naked and bound body was found hanging in a @entity5 mansion two years ago has filed a federal lawsuit accusing three people of plotting her death			1
the @entity10 medical examiner ruled that @entity11 committed suicide , but a lawsuit filed friday by her mother and sister contends she was the victim of a murder plot devised by her millionaire boyfriend 's brother , ex-wife and the ex-wife 's twin sister			1
@entity11 's boyfriend , @entity22 , owned the @entity24 , @entity5 , vacation home where she was found dead on july 13 , 2011			1
his 6 - year - old son , @entity25 , suffered a fall in the same home two days earlier and died in a hospital on july 16 , 2011			1
the lawsuit filed by the dead woman 's mother , @entity31 , and sister , @entity32 , does not detail the alleged plot , but it contends each defendant " participated in some manner in the planning , implementation , execution and subsequent concealment of the scheme to murder @entity11			2
" the defendants named are @entity42 of @entity43 ; @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity46 ; and @entity47 from @entity48 , @entity5			0
@entity44 is the mother of @entity25 , the boy who died from the fall			0
" defendants intentionally , willfully , wantonly and maliciously threatened to cause immediate physical harm to @entity11 by threatening to stalk , attack , choke , gag , bound , and hang her at the premises , " the complaint said			0
efforts by @entity0 to reach the defendants or their lawyers for comment were unsuccessful sunday			0
after @entity11 's death was ruled a suicide and @entity10 officials refused to pursue criminal charges , @entity22 asked the @entity5 attorney general 's office to investigate his son 's fatal fall and his girlfriend 's hanging			1
he said he hoped a state inquiry would bring a " dignified resolution for everyone who has been touched by the horrible events of this summer			0
" the attorney general cited the " state 's scarce resources " in a letter declining to investigate , but @entity11 's family hired their own investigators to challenge the findings that she committed suicide			1
a renowned forensic pathologist hired by the family said four bruises found on the top of her head indicate trauma not readily explained by the hanging			0
he said in september 2011 that it was just one of several reasons he would n't have ruled the death a suicide			2
authorities first went to the home , in the @entity10 suburb of @entity24 , on july 11 after getting a call from @entity11 's 13 - year - old sister reporting that @entity25 had fallen down the stairs and was not breathing , @entity24 police @entity101			1
@entity11 , her sister and the boy were the only ones in the residence at the time of the incident			0
police arrived within two minutes , followed a minute later by firefighters who , after finding the boy unconscious on the floor , " began lifesaving measures immediately , " @entity103 said			0
but despite extensive medical treatment , @entity114 died five days later			2
the medical examiner ruled the boy 's death an accident			1
on july 13 , authorities got another 911 call from the home			0
this time , it was @entity42 , @entity22 's brother , reporting that he found @entity11 hanging , @entity124 @entity123 said			1
@entity42 , who was staying in a guest house that morning , told investigators that he climbed onto a table and cut the body loose before investigators arrived , authorities said			0
@entity123 said investigators were comfortable with the brother 's account			0
@entity22 , a lawyer and the founder and ceo of @entity138 , was at a children 's hospital or a @entity140 from the time when investigators believe the suicide happened to the time @entity11 's body was reported , @entity10 sheriff 's lt. @entity135 said			1
the autopsy concluded that @entity11 was " alive when she went over the ( second - floor ) balcony " with a t - shirt wrapped around her neck , the medical examiner said			1
there was no evidence of a struggle or a sexual assault , or that she was rendered unconscious or incapacitated , adding that " her feet were dirty , consistent with standing on the dirty balcony , " he said			0
though investigators do n't know the order of events , they believe she removed her clothing , painted a message , cut a rope into sections , secured the long portion to a bed , bound her feet , placed the rope and the shirt around her neck , fashioned wrist bindings , secured her hands in the binding behind her back , moved to the balcony , leaned over the rail and fell , @entity10 sheriff 's sgt. @entity157 said			2
@entity157 said one person told investigators that in january , @entity11 had " lost weight , seemed stressed , was not sleeping well and was not exercising , which was abnormal for her			0
" other interviewees indicated that " @entity11 was distraught over @entity25 's injury , " @entity157 said			2
but @entity11 family attorney @entity182 had previously said that one of @entity11 's sisters , who talked to her the night before her death , said @entity11 " was completely fine " and did n't feel guilty about @entity114 's fall			1
" my sister never had a psychiatric problem , never ( had ) been on psychiatric medication and never had attempted suicide , let alone ever talked about harming herself , " @entity187 said in an interview weeks after her sister 's death .			2

the @entity10 medical examiner ruled @entity11 's death a suicide
@entity11 's family did a *private* investigation after officials would n't press criminal charges
lawsuit accuses boyfriend 's brother , ex-wife and ex-wife 's twin of plotting her death
@entity11 died two days after her boyfriend 's son suffered a fatal fall in the same home
