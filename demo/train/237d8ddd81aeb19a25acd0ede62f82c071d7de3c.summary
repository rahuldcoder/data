-- the national conversation over @entity3 's killing is loud and intense			1
in some places , it 's also vile and violent			1
the case -- in which a @entity8 neighborhood watch volunteer killed the unarmed black teen in @entity10 , @entity11 , on february 26 -- has sparked a national controversy			1
it has also stoked extremist views , particularly on the @entity16 , experts say			1
@entity17 said he shot @entity3 in self - defense after the teen attacked him			1
@entity3 's family has disputed that			1
investigators have not charged @entity17			1
the @entity22 , the civil rights group that fights bigotry , said√Ç the case has stirred up " extremists on both sides of the racial divide			1
" a visitor to the website of one white supremacist group , for example , left a comment calling @entity3 " a punk negroe who messed with the wrong guy			1
" meanwhile , the @entity36 has offered a $ 10,000 reward for anyone who " captures " @entity17 , an offer that @entity3 's family has condemned			1
the @entity40 , which fights bigotry , said that " white nationalists are trying to inject their poison " into the case , too , portraying the teen as a " scary black man who deserved what he got			1
" " they have defamed @entity3 , concocted false allegations and amplified racial stereotypes of young black men -- in effect , putting the victim on trial in the court of public opinion , " the group said			1
@entity57 , an expert on extremists for the @entity22 , says white supremacist attitudes often emerge during such hot - button controversies			1
" you see this every time there really is something like this , " an attempt to portray victims as perpetrators and this slain 17 - year - old as a " gangster thug , " he said			2
the incident has created a " mob mentality , " according to a commentary from @entity72 , a @entity0 contributor who served as secretary of education under president @entity76			0
" the facts are confounding and inconclusive			0
but the tendency in the first days by some , including @entity81 , @entity82 and an angry chorus of followers , was to rush to judgment with little regard for fairness , due process , or respect for the terrible death of a young man , " @entity72 said			0
he noted that film director @entity92 tweeted what he thought was @entity17 's home address			1
it turned out to be the wrong address , though , and it " resulted in an older couple fleeing from their home and fearing for their lives after threats and crowds outside their residence			0
" @entity92 apologized to the couple and said he would pay the couple 's cost of leaving their home			2
@entity108 , an assistant professor of political science at @entity110 , said he 's not surprised to hear about hate speech sprouting up			2
he said the @entity16 intensifies it			1
" as soon as something like this happens , bloggers focus on it			0
people that follow them share that content , " he said			0
he said the hate shows up in comments under stories and essays on the @entity125 -- comments that almost always are n't signed by the writers			2
" people will say what they want to say under the cover of anonymity , " he said			0
" go to almost any website that deals with this issue , " @entity108 said			0
if there are no filters , the hate pours through , he said			0
@entity136 , senior faculty member for ethics at @entity138 , a nonprofit school for journalists in @entity140 , @entity11 , said she is n't surprised that extremist talk has emerged in this case			2
" there have always been people who believe racist things and those people have existed on a continuum , " she said			0
hate speech involving immigration and sexual orientation also ripples across the @entity125			0
people who do n't pay " super close attention to these issues may not notice the hate speech on a regular basis , " she said			0
" the internet affords people anonymity and insulation , " she said			0
@entity57 said the @entity3 case reminds him of what happened with @entity161 , the black @entity162 employee who was engulfed in controversy two years ago			2
late blogger @entity164 posted an edited and incomplete video of a speech by @entity161 , making her appear to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance			2
a full version of the speech , however , showed that @entity161 had assisted the farmer			0
the department later offered @entity161 her job back when it was clear she had been misrepresented			0
@entity57 noted that she was briefly portrayed as anti-white and was briefly demonized			0
he compared the slams at @entity161 to the doubt cast on @entity3 's character .			2
