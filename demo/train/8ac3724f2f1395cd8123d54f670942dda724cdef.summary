@entity0 -- when two focus groups met earlier this week -- conducted using " @entity5 moms " or women ages 29 - 54 who 've shopped at the big - box retailer recently , they revealed the secret behind how this crucial demographic decides whom they vote for this year : @entity13			1
" @entity17 it , " said participants from @entity15 when asked about their voting decision process			1
" probably the night before , " said another @entity15 woman , on when she looks up information on candidates			0
the women were part of two , ten - person groups in @entity15 and @entity25 on monday night that were underwritten by @entity5			1
in both states , female democratic senators are running in tight reelection races , meaning that the women in the focus groups represent an essential category of voters @entity34 need to keep those seats and hold on to control of the @entity37			1
the racially , ethnically and educationally diverse group of mothers expressed concern about the future throughout most of the three - hours of focus grouping			1
many were concerned about @entity44 and less so about @entity45			0
they can recall the negative ads in their respective @entity37 races , but on the whole , do n't know the candidates well			1
and even though @entity51 have tried to tie every @entity52 to president @entity53 , the women did n't see the unpopular president as a campaign issue , even if they think he is doing a bad job			1
what was most striking in the group , however , was how distant the @entity37 races in each state felt to the women			1
according to the @entity62 , in @entity25 's @entity37 race , between @entity52 @entity64 , @entity51 @entity65 and independent @entity66 , almost $ 40 million has been spent			0
upwards of $ 80 million has been spent in the race between @entity69 and @entity70 in @entity15			0
all that money , though , has bought very little with these women			1
" nothing is going to change , " said @entity73 , a 44 - year old @entity15			2
politicians " stand where they stand			0
nothing is going to change the next two weeks			0
it is going to be like you are cramming for a test			0
" their interest does n't mean they are n't concerned , however			2
the @entity5 moms of this particular focus group say they are worried about the future , anxious about their children and feel like politicians in @entity0 do n't understand their daily struggle			1
we are " out of site , out of mind , " said @entity94 , a 38 - year old cafeteria worker and mother of one			2
" unless you are out there serving that child at school , or helping that student with just learning how to be nice with one another ... or you are getting up at 4:30 in the morning so you can beat the rush hour and get to work on time			0
" after a slight pause , she added			0
" they do n't [ understand ] , they ca n't			1
" when asked what one message they would communicate to leaders in @entity0 , the women struck a similar tune : my representatives in @entity0 have lost touch with their roots and do n't understand my struggle			1
" i wish you could have been in my shoes , and seen [ the ] struggle of a single parent , " said @entity118 , a 40 - year old women who voted for @entity53 in 2012			1
" i remember where i came from , " said @entity124 , a 32 - year old mother of three who voted for @entity126			2
" i work hard for everything i have , tangible and intangible , " said @entity94			0
her comment resonated with the women , they nodded as she said it			2
in @entity15 , most of the mothers recalled very little about @entity70 or @entity69			0
@entity70 , they said , was trying to portray @entity69 as unstable , while @entity69 was trying to cast @entity70 as another vote for @entity53 , the women said			2
but other than that , not much stuck			0
in @entity25 , where there was slightly more definition , the women struggled to name all three candidates			2
the women could remember @entity64 's positive ad -- including a " cute " one with her father -- and recalled attacks that " she does n't even live here any more			1
" ( earlier this year , questions about @entity64 's residency were raised by a story in the @entity151 that said the senator does n't own her own house in @entity25 and , instead , lives at her home on @entity155 in @entity0 the senator has vehemently denied the charge			1
) " if she does n't live here , how is she supposed to know what the true problems are , " said one woman			2
" how is she supposed to know ? " but that is really where the recollections ended			0
what did universally stick , however , was that all the campaigning has been negative			0
" all i get from all of those [ ads ] is do n't vote for that person , because they are a bad person , vote for me , " said one woman in @entity15			2
when asked what the @entity64 campaign wanted voters to think about @entity65 , one woman in @entity174 put it this way : " that he is the devil			0
" the reason they feel disconnected , according to women in both @entity15 and @entity25 , is that the people who represent them in @entity0 are of little concern to them because those politicians could never fathom their daily struggle			1
the women told stories about struggling to pay for their children 's education , their health care and their groceries			2
they talked about dealing with their spouse 's job loss or trying to make ends meet with little			0
they also became animated when talking about the upcoming holidays and how they plan to save money to provide all they can or their kids			0
and when reflecting on all of this , the women said the same thing : the politicians asking for my vote do n't get all of this			1
" moms say politicians ' do n't get it ' and need to ' walk in my shoes , ' " read a memo about the conversation from @entity218 and @entity219 , two pollsters who helped organize the group			1
" this is a perennial @entity5 mom complaint that frankly only gets louder with each conversation			0
" this sentiment was encapsulated by @entity94 , the woman from @entity15 who said she struggled for everything she has			0
" once they go home to the farm , it is n't a dirty farm , " she said of when lawmakers leave @entity15 and go to @entity0			1
when they come home , she said , their farm " is a clean farm ... with a tractor that would make @entity236 faint			0

two focus groups were conducted using women ages 29 - 54 , a crucial demographic
a common theme in both groups : their @entity0 representatives do n't understand their struggle
most participants could n't recall much of the political advertising aimed at them
@entity218 and @entity219 are two pollsters who helped organize the group
