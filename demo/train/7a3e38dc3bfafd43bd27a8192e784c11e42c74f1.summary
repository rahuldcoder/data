-- @entity1 will add the @entity2 to their @entity4 title by beating the @entity5 in sunday 's final , according to @entity8 football legend @entity7			1
the 63 - year - old was the leading figure in @entity5 's revolutionary " total football " approach in the 1970s , when he also starred for @entity13 giants @entity12 for five years before managing the @entity15 club from 1988 to 1996			1
@entity7 's compatriots are seeking to earn the northern @entity4 nation a first @entity2 title , having lost in the 1974 final in @entity20 and then again in @entity21 four years later when he had retired from the international stage			1
however , the former @entity24 player and manager believes @entity27 winners @entity1 will break their own title drought on soccer 's biggest stage in their first final in @entity32			1
" @entity1 have always had good footballers and never a team , but now they have one , " he said , as quoted by the @entity34 @entity33			1
" they have worked very well in the last few years and if they get into their rhythm , they should win			0
normally @entity1 play better [ than @entity5 ] but that does n't mean they will win			1
" @entity7 said coach @entity44 's unbeaten @entity8 side would present a difficult challenge for the @entity13			1
dream swansong for @entity8 captain " @entity5 is a very balanced team , they know their strengths and their weaknesses , and up until now they have always been able to make their strengths shine through , " he said			1
" they have two or three players playing at an exceptional level at the @entity2 and the team 's level has risen enormously			1
" @entity1 must improve on their form so far if they are to become the first team in 36 years to win the @entity64 and then the @entity2 , according to midfielder @entity65			1
only two teams have ever held both titles at once , with @entity68 doing it the other way around to @entity20 by winning the @entity70 and then @entity71			0
@entity73 's @entity1 team have yet to fire on all cylinders at the tournament , losing to @entity76 in the opening match and then winning all three knockout stage matches 1 - 0 -- including the semifinal against @entity20			1
striker @entity80 has struggled to regain his form after knee surgery , leaving five - goal @entity83 to shoulder attacking responsibilities			0
" the initial defeat against @entity76 upset us all , " @entity65 said			2
" it was the first game and from that moment we had no margin for error			0
we knew we could not fail			0
i hope it proves to be the only game we lose			0
" we will play better because we will probably have to if we are going to win the @entity2			2
what we did in the semifinal certainly wo n't help us to win the final			2
" but i have confidence in my teammates , and i think this group is able to take the final step			2
" @entity65 said his cohorts were well aware of the enormity of the occasion ahead			2
" this is a historic event , a unique opportunity for us all			0
it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up just thinking about it , " the 26 - year - old said			0
" we have all dreamed of this moment			0
but we have to finish the dream			0
we can not celebrate anything yet			0
before us is the challenge of winning a @entity2			2
" we are cautious because we know that we still have the last step , and that last step is the most difficult and the most beautiful			0
