@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 on tuesday spent a second day digging in a @entity5 - area field in the latest search for the remains of former @entity9 boss @entity8 -- an effort spurred by information from an aging reputed mobster			1
agents began digging monday in waist - high grass in @entity0 north of @entity5 , a location determined in part from information provided by alleged mobster @entity18			1
media and curious onlookers gathered some distance from the private property			0
the search was stopped for the night as evening approached but will resume wednesday at 8 a.m. nothing yet has been found , two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation said tuesday afternoon			1
@entity0 sheriff @entity27 said investigators are using probes to determine what the ground makeup is , but have not found samples that would require lab analysis			0
two concrete slabs have been removed during the dig. it 's unclear whether the slabs were foundations for a barn that once stood there			1
scientists from @entity42 were at the site tuesday to help with soil analysis			0
agents are expected to finish the search this week , possibly in the next 48 hours , @entity45 said			2
this is the latest chapter of the nearly four - decades - long search for @entity8			1
it was sparked by " highly credible " information from @entity18 , according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation			2
earlier this year , @entity18 , now in his 80s , told @entity57 's @entity56 that @entity8 was buried in a @entity1 field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen in 1975			1
@entity8 , then 62 , disappeared after being seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside a @entity5 - area restaurant			1
the @entity3 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity8 's efforts to regain power in the @entity9 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
the @entity3 spent months looking into @entity18 's claims before seeking court authorization to excavate the field and look for evidence of a shallow grave , according to a law enforcement source			0
contrary to what 's been thought for years , @entity18 said he was told @entity8 's disappearance was not connected to @entity77 , the @entity57 - area @entity78 crime boss who allegedly wanted to get rid of @entity8			1
instead , according to the source , @entity18 -- convicted years ago of crimes in connection with organized crime in @entity5 -- told the @entity3 that @entity5 mobsters wanted @entity8 dead			1
at the time , @entity8 was thought to be trying to get back into a power position with the labor movement after his release from prison			1
he was convicted in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			0
president @entity91 pardoned him in 1971			0
@entity18 was in prison himself when @entity8 disappeared			2
@entity18 , according to the law enforcement source , said that when he was freed , he asked a mob enforcer what happened to @entity8			1
the mobster allegedly told @entity18 that @entity5 's crime bosses ordered the @entity8 hit			1
they lured him to a meeting and then drove him to a farm owned by a mob underboss			0
the enforcer allegedly told @entity18 that @entity8 was killed and buried on the property , which covers several acres			2
@entity18 's attorney , @entity105 , told reporters monday that @entity18 was told @entity8 was hit with a shovel and buried alive			2
@entity18 published a manuscript about the @entity8 claim online that includes details of the alleged hit			1
" he was n't shot , he was n't stabbed , nothing like that			0
a cement slab of some sort was placed on top of the dirt to make certain he was not going to be discovered			0
end of story , " @entity18 's manuscript says			0
the area being searched was described as relatively small -- about the size of a small party tent , according to the source			2
aerial video showed a somewhat larger area had been cleared of grass			0
@entity18 has been to the site more than once , said @entity105 , who declined to elaborate			0
@entity8 's daughter , @entity130 , told @entity2 by phone tuesday that she is always appreciative when the @entity3 follows credible leads in the case			2
but , she said , she does n't want to get her hopes up			0
" we 've been through it too many times , " she said			0
@entity3 special agent @entity138 , head of the agency 's @entity5 office , told @entity2 at the scene that the information leading to the search " reached the threshold of probable cause , which was sufficient to allow us to obtain a search warrant			1
" the paperwork supporting the search warrant is under seal			0
" if it did n't rise to that level then , certainly , we would n't be out here , " @entity138 said			0
@entity8 's disappearance and presumed death have vexed investigators			2
as recently as october , soil samples were taken from a home in a suburban @entity5 community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after @entity8 disappeared			1
the soil samples were tested , and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition			0
@entity18 was freed in 2008 after his last prison sentence			0
@entity168 , a former @entity169 attorney , told @entity2 earlier this year that @entity18 headed a @entity5 organized crime family from 1970 to 1975 , but was in prison when @entity8 vanished			1
in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity173 , @entity18 denied playing any role in @entity8 's disappearance			2
@entity18 told @entity2 affiliate @entity176 on tuesday that he hoped authorities would find the remains of his " good friend , " to put @entity8 's family at ease and put this story to rest			1
" i 'd like to see him exhumed and be buried properly , like he deserves to be , " he said			0
man convicted in mob crimes says he 's ' certain ' where @entity8 is buried @entity2 's @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			2
