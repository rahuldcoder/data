-- it all started out quite innocently , with jokes about the @entity3 's perma - frown and @entity5 collections of weird , what - the - @entity7 moments from the opening ceremony			2
from there , however , the @entity11 conversation about the @entity12 has taken a rapid turn toward the troll - ish			1
athletes have been flaming sports announcers and lobbing racist comments at people from other countries			2
pretty much everyone on the @entity22 has contributed to the # @entity24 hashtag			2
a spectator told a @entity27 diver that his fourth - place finish " let your dad down			0
" ( a dad , by the way , who died of cancer last year			0
) and @entity11 itself has come under fire for briefly deleting the account of one of the @entity39 ' and @entity40 's biggest critics , purportedly for breaking the site 's terms or use			1
was n't this supposed to be the " @entity44 , " where everyone rejoiced in the digital - era magic of hearing directly from the world 's best athletes and scrolling through a global , real - time conversation about what must be the planet 's most " @entity52 " - like sporting event ? it was			1
the @entity55 even promoted it as such			0
but maybe that was the wrong expectation for a communications platform that has become much more than a feel - good public relations tool			0
as @entity60 wrote on monday for @entity61 , @entity11 has also helped fuel dictator - toppling protest movements			1
" it 's almost as if the @entity55 is completely unaware of the role @entity11 and @entity66 played in the @entity67 , " he wrote , " or the frequency with which people use it to communicate in real time			1
" in terms of numbers , the @entity39 certainly have been the @entity44 , far outpacing both the @entity74 and @entity75 , when @entity11 was n't quite the global communications phenom it has become in 2012			1
" there were more tweets in a single day last week than during the entire 2008 @entity82 , " @entity11 wrote in a blog post on its @entity27 site , adding that more than 60 % of @entity27 athletes are on @entity11			1
" we 've already seen 10 million mentions of the term olympics during the @entity39 as fans use @entity11 to get to the heart of the action , " the company said			1
( enough of that traffic came from @entity89 , by the way , that the @entity92 committee reportedly asked spectators to refrain from tweeting and texting unless it 's " urgent , " in an effort to lessen the network 's load			0
) over the years , @entity11 , which did not respond to a request for comment on this story , has become the @entity12 ' " cocktail hour , " where both athletes and couch dwellers chatter about the games , said @entity105 , spokesman for @entity106 , a social media tracker			1
in 2010 , he said , more than 307,000 tweets contained the term " @entity12 " on the first weekend of the @entity110 in @entity111			1
this year , that number jumped tenfold , to more than 3.5 million tweets on the opening weekend of the @entity39 in @entity89			1
" two or four years ago it was n't as common			0
four years ago , especially , it was really just people in their houses saying ' oh my gosh did you see that dive			0
' it was people talking to their social circles , " he said			0
" as twitter as a platform has evolved and behavior has evolved , it is happening on both ends			0
now there are way more athletes who are on			0
and there are way more people who are sharing their viewing habits , on @entity11 especially			1
" 12 great @entity12 - related @entity11 accounts what those athletes say , however , can be another matter			1
a @entity141 athlete was expelled from the @entity39 after he called @entity143 athletes " mongoloids , " according to @entity144 ; and a @entity147 triple - jumper was banned for writing on @entity11 that " with so many @entity150 in @entity147 , the mosquitoes from the @entity149 will at least be eating some homemade food			1
" more benign , but still unexpected , was @entity152 , an @entity153 soccer star , who used her @entity11 feed to blast player - turned - analyst @entity155 , telling @entity40 to employ a soccer commentator who " knows more about the game			1
" and several prominent olympians have taken to @entity11 in protest of @entity161			1
that rule bans the athletes from using their social media accounts to promote companies other than the official @entity92 sponsors			0
" i am honored to be an @entity168 , but # @entity170 # @entity169 " several of the athletes posted			0
opinion : should we trust @entity11 ? that kind of political dissent is new , said @entity176 , a senior projects editor at @entity61 who is covering the @entity39			1
" athletes are taking to @entity11 to voice frustrations with the way that the sports system is currently constructed and oriented , " he said by phone from @entity89			1
" that 's something we really have n't seen before -- or not in such a coordinated way , having a couple dozen really prominent @entity168 starting to really talk about those issues			0
beyond that i think it 's just so much more part of how these athletes interact with the world than ever before , certainly			0
we saw some people tweeting at @entity74 and a few more at @entity111 -- and now it 's just part of the oxygen			1
" the @entity39 , however , have been testing the limits of how far @entity11 , @entity40 and law enforcement will let the spitfire of real - time conversation go			1
@entity27 police reportedly arrested a 17 - year - old " on suspicion of malicious communications " after he sent a @entity11 message to @entity27 diver @entity201 telling the diver he had disappointed his recently deceased father by placing fourth in monday 's synchronized diving competition on the 10 - meter platform			2
the @entity207 erupted monday and tuesday after @entity11 temporarily suspended the account of @entity209 , a journalist who had been one of the harshest critics of @entity40 's decision to televise the @entity12 on a delay in the @entity153			1
@entity40 complained to @entity11 after @entity209 posted the e-mail address of one of its executives , asking people to air grievances with him			2
@entity11 then suspended the account , saying that posting another person 's private info is a violation of its terms			2
meet the man who started # @entity24 but some media analysts cried foul , saying @entity209 effectively was censored because of his views			0
" what makes this a serious issue is that @entity11 has partnered with @entity40 during the @entity12 , " @entity226 wrote for @entity227			1
" and it was @entity40 's complaint about @entity209 that led to the suspension			0
that alone raises reasonable suspicions about @entity11 's motives			2
" @entity209 ' account was reinstated on tuesday			0
not all the @entity92 chatter is negative , of course			2
as @entity11 notes on its @entity27 blog , the phrase " good luck " has been used more than 1.2 million times on the network since the @entity12 began			1
and , according to @entity106 , the @entity246 hashtag , which is the digital warehouse for complaints about the network 's coverage in the @entity153 , got less traffic over the weekend than @entity252 " @entity251 did during his three minutes onstage during friday 's opening ceremony			0
even the man credited with creating the # @entity24 meme said he thinks things have gotten a little out of hand			0
" in some ways it 's showing some of the worst sides of what this instant media can do , " said @entity258 , a 48 - year - old who had only 17 @entity11 followers before the hashtag spread			2
" it 's sort of that mob mentality that @entity11 encourages			2
i think in this sense it 's showing the bad			0
but in the @entity272 ( @entity271 ) movement , it showed the good that @entity11 can do for organizing			2
even though it 's made me slightly famous , i 'm not necessarily thrilled with what 's happened			0
i 'm not terribly impressed with @entity40 , but that 's not new this year			0
" others are merely finding fun in the sport of being grouchy			0
" i 'm glad for @entity11 so i can get real time results , " one @entity11 user wrote in response to a @entity0 question about the topic			2
" a lot of the complaining is really funny , so i 've been enjoying it			0

the @entity39 are being *billed* as the " @entity44 "
but much of the online conversation has *devolved* into criticism of the @entity39
@entity11 is far more *popular* now than it was at the @entity74 and @entity111 @entity12
writer says it has become " oxygen " of the games , fueling both *positive* and negative
