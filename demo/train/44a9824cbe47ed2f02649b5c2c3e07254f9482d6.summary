-- @entity2 authorities are putting new pressure on the owner of the meltdown - stricken @entity6 nuclear plant after its admission that highly radioactive water from the site has been seeping into groundwater and the harbor off the plant			1
a top official said tuesday that the government wanted the problem solved " as soon as possible , " while an official at @entity2 's nuclear regulatory agency told @entity19 on monday that the issue was an " emergency			1
" three reactors melted down at @entity6 after the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck @entity2 in march 2011			1
the result was the worst nuclear accident since the @entity29 's @entity28 incident in 1986			0
the meltdown complicated an already historic disaster			0
scientists have pointed to ongoing high radiation levels in the waters off the plant for more than a year to warn of an ongoing leak			1
the @entity37 admitted to the problem in july , disclosing that it had found high concentrations of reactor byproducts tritium , cesium - 137 and strontium - 90 in test wells and in the harbor outside the coastal power plant			1
" it 's a present reality that the contaminated water is seeping out to the bay without us being able to control it , " @entity45 , @entity37 's acting nuclear power chief , said this week			1
" this is an extremely serious issue we must tackle			1
" @entity6 tuna study finds miniscule health risks @entity45 said the company has built an underground barrier to prevent contaminated groundwater from reaching the sea , but it 's a difficult problem			1
" we think we are containing the movement of contaminated water in general , but there is a risk of excess water going around or coming over the barrier , " he said			2
@entity37 has been struggling to manage vast quantities of contaminated water at the plant since the tsunami , which swamped the facility			1
it 's still pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the plant to cool the crippled reactors , though most of that is recycled			2
the problem now is what to do with groundwater that 's leaking into the damaged basements of the reactor buildings and passing out contaminated , said @entity81 , a former nuclear plant operator and engineer			1
radiation damaged more souls than bodies " instead of fixing the wall in the basement to stop the groundwater leakage , they ca n't because the building is uninhabitable , " he said			0
the result is the company is having to store the radioactive water in massive tank farms built around the site -- a makeshift solution with no good permanent fix , @entity81 said			2
" over time , they 've had radioactive water leaks on the property and there 's probably no question there is some seepage from the buildings themselves , " he said			2
" at the end of the day you have radioactive materials in places where they 're not supposed to be , " and that contamination " will migrate into places you do n't want it			0
" the issue drew a sharp response this week from an official at @entity2 's @entity120 , a new agency created in the wake of the disaster			0
@entity123 , the head of an @entity120 task force , told @entity19 on monday that @entity37 's " sense of crisis is weak			2
" " right now , we have an emergency , " he said			0
man who battled @entity2 's nuclear meltdown dies and @entity131 , @entity2 's chief cabinet secretary , said tuesday that the government wants to see the problem fixed quickly			0
" we are going to put our full efforts toward resolving the issues , " @entity131 said			0
sampling results disclosed in july showed concentrations of tritium in one well as high as 500,000 bequerels -- a unit of radioactive intensity -- per liter of water			0
by comparison , @entity2 's maximum safe level of radioactivity in drinking water for adults is 300 bequerels per liter			0
@entity149 , a @entity150 marine chemist , was one of the scientists who raised alarms about ongoing contamination early on			1
@entity149 told @entity0 that building new groundwater barriers is may be a futile effort			0
google maps show @entity6 nuclear ghost town " think of groundwater like a river , " he said			2
" if there 's a flow to the ocean , you can put up a dam , but eventually it 's going to go up and over it or around to the sides ... it flows from higher to lower , and the ocean 's the low point			0
" and @entity81 said that may leave @entity37 and @entity2 's government with two choices sure to stoke further public anger : " you can either dump it in the ocean , or you can evaporate it			2
" " at the end of the day , collecting 400 tons of water every single day is not a sustainable solution , " he said			1
federal officials allowed the @entity180 nuclear plant in @entity181 , the site of the worst @entity150 nuclear accident , to let contaminated water evaporate , @entity81 said -- but @entity180 was nowhere near the scale of the @entity6 disaster			1
" we 're in uncharted territory here , " he said			0
@entity2 signs deal with @entity189 to build nuclear plant @entity0 's @entity191 contributed to this report .			0

tainted water seeps from @entity6 plant , plant owner discloses
scientists have been warning about the problem for more than a year
" this is an extremely serious issue we must tackle , " @entity37 says
storing the water " is not a sustainable solution , " @entity150 engineer says
