-- if you are one of the lucky many to have received a new tablet or smartphone over the holidays , congratulations ! you 'll want to rip open the box and start playing right away			1
but before you do something potentially distracting like downloading dots , here are some starter tips to make the most of your new device , whether it 's an @entity15 , @entity17 smartphone or @entity18			1
prevent heartbreak with security measures your new gadget is shiny and amazing and already precious to you			1
so it might be hard to imagine a dark day in the future when you are careless enough to leave it in the airplane seat pocket in front of you or unlucky enough to have it stolen			0
bad things will happen , but there are a few steps you can take now to make it hurt a little less down the line			0
first , turn on the screen - lock setting which will require a passcode or password ( or fingerprint or face recognition ) every time you turn on the phone or tablet			1
this is your number one defense against someone accessing sensitive financial and personal information if they find or steal your device			1
it will also make it more difficult for them to wipe it and erase any information you did n't back up			0
logging in every time will seem like a slight inconvenience at first , but after a few days you 'll hardly notice you 're doing it and the few seconds will become a forgotten routine			0
next , download or activate any lost - device location features so that you can track the physical location of your tablet or phone if it is lost or stolen			1
@entity65 products have find my iphone installed by default , but you must connect your device to an @entity71 account			1
android devices can use the @entity74 device manager			1
make a backup plan whether you end up using your tablet or smartphones primarily for communication , enjoying content like movies and books , or creating original content like drawings and work documents , you 'll want to back up your device			1
you can go through the default backup tools , such as @entity71 or @entity86 on @entity87 or the @entity89 settings on @entity74			0
third - party apps can also come in handy , like @entity91 , @entity92 or @entity93			1
when possible , use individual apps that automatically sync anything you create to the cloud			2
get a case a new gadget 's pristine screen and body are so pretty to look at , so gloriously unscuffed and unsullied			0
you may think it would be a shame to hide its glory under some cheap plastic case			0
you know what 's worse ? living with a broken and scratched device that cost hundreds of dollars			2
it happens far too often			0
just look around your local coffee shop and count the number of people working around a cracked screen , dragging their bleeding or calloused fingers over fractured glass held together with clear packaging tape			0
if you 're clumsy or have children or are prone to the forces of gravity , consider buying a case			0
save money the first bill on a new mobile device can be a shocker when you easily breeze past your data limit or rack up roaming charges			1
if your device is on a cellular plan , take precautions and set a mobile data warning or limit to prevent you from going over			1
the option is under @entity133 on @entity74 devices			0
if you 're using an @entity65 device , you can monitor how much data your device is eating up under settings - > cellular - > system services ( at the very bottom of the page )			1
it groups data usage by the type of service like @entity145			2
if you deduce a specific app is sucking down the most data , you can revoke its ability to use cellular data here too			2
you can also install third - party apps to monitor data usage , some of which break it down by individual apps			1
@entity159 and music streaming apps are big data hogs , so make sure you 're on a wireless network before binge watching @entity163			1
if texting or calling charges are a concern , download calling and messaging apps that work over @entity168 like @entity169 , what 's @entity171 and @entity172			1
delete the junk fresh out of the box , many devices are set up to favor their creators ' or carriers ' preferred apps			2
the problem is especially bad with @entity74 and @entity181 phones sold through third - party carriers , which like to preinstall all sorts of bloatware			0
go through and delete any promotional or unwanted apps right away			2
if you ca n't delete the app on @entity74 , you can probably disable it in settings so that it is out of sight			0
@entity65 devices are more conservative with preinstalled apps , but there is a core group of @entity87 apps you ca n't uninstall			2
if you really do n't want to use them , stash them away in a folder			0
this is also the time to make some cosmetic adjustments , like picking a new wallpaper and organizing your apps , so that you do n't have to readjust to a new layout later			2
prone to motion - sickness ? switch off the parallax setting on @entity87			0
download starter apps while not junk , some of the default apps might not be the best option for you			2
for example , @entity65 's @entity214 app , while vastly improved over its original buggy version , still is n't as good as @entity214 , which can be downloaded from the @entity216 ( @entity214 makes a number of must - have apps for @entity87 )			2
there are a host of weather , calendar , note - taking , and camera alternatives to test out before setting down with the defaults			0
hunting for and downloading new apps is the most exciting part of a new gadget			0
start with the basics , like @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			0
if you 're a news junkie , get the apps for your favorite outlets , any local channels or publications , and your favorite news aggregation app. keep yourself organized with @entity239 , and if you 're part of a couple , download @entity242 ( if not for the sweet private messaging stuff , than because it 's a handy way to coordinate to - do lists )			1
if you are a subscriber to any video or music streaming services , download the mobile apps ( @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 )			1
if you 've already started anthropomorphizing your @entity255 or @entity15 , just go all the way and download @entity257			0
here are suggestions of apps for travelers , apps for weathering storms and apps for staying healthy			0
if you have kids you may start out telling yourself you wo n't let the children play with your tablet or smartphone , but it only takes one twitchy toddler in a nice restaurant to kill that dream			1
if your device has parental controls , set them up early to prevent any unwanted app purchases , work emails or cryptic @entity231 postings			1
if you are going to record a video make sure your device is horizontal			0
vertically shot movies are a plague that must be stopped			0
if you 're replacing an old tablet or phone do n't forget to wipe your old device completely before handing it down , selling it on @entity285 , or donating it to a local charity .			1
