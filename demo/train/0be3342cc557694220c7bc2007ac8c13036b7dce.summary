-- on june 30 , in the streets of @entity3 , i watched crowds stream down @entity6 street , one of the city 's main roads , chanting : " the @entity10 ! the people ! are one hand ! " officers posed for photos , waved @entity16 flags from pickup trucks jammed with @entity19 protesters and roared up @entity3 's wide boulevards on their motorcycles to cheers and waves			1
some in the crowd refused to join in , but this was , just the same , a sight i never imagined i would see , after over two years of sit - ins in which the police had been the protesters ' clear enemy			2
from the beginnins of @entity16 's uprising , in january 2011 , the overhaul of @entity16 's police forces , known for torturing detainees and brutally dispersing peaceful demonstrations , was a key demand of protesters			1
but not even the most rudimentary reforms have taken place since then			0
neither the @entity42 of @entity43 , which governed @entity16 during the transitional period , nor @entity45 during his year as president made any attempt whatsoever to take on police brutality and torture			1
the army itself was responsible for similar abuses during the transitional period			0
police officers have yet to be held accountable for excessive use of force over the past two and a half years			2
police killed at least 846 protestors in january 2011			2
but of 38 officers sent to trial for the killings , only two have been sentenced and jailed			0
now @entity16 has once again descended into spasms of violence			1
over the last two weeks in @entity3 and @entity66 , armed @entity65 supporters have fired automatic weapons on @entity19 protesters who are armed with rocks and @entity70 while police and army have stood and watched			1
neighborhood protection groups in both cities have engaged in hours - long combat with armed @entity45 supporters who marched through their communities damaging property and harassing passersby			0
in the grim corridors of @entity66 's public hospitals and the dusty courtyard of the city 's morgue , grieving relatives and friends described watching army and police officers use deadly force against demonstrators in front of the @entity93 headquarters , where the deposed president was allegedly being held			2
fifty - one people were killed on the morning of july 8			0
the pattern that emerges is this : in every instance , police and sometimes army troops have acted in a partisan fashion , using what appears to be largely unwarranted force against mostly unarmed @entity65 supporters at sit - ins , yet doing little to intervene when opposing camps clash violently			1
a group of outraged women in @entity109 , a leafy island in the @entity110 , told me how during a 10 - hour street battle they repeatedly called police , the army -- anyone who could possibly offer protection -- while their sons and husbands fought @entity65 supporters with paving stones and @entity121			1
@entity122 , a 27 - year - old wearing jeans still spattered with blood from the night before , told me : " @entity125 came in aggressively , hitting people , cars and shops so that no one would get in their way			0
" they entered the neighborhood around 8 p.m. , he said , but police only arrived at midnight , stayed for about half an hour , then retreated , though the fighting continued until 6 a.m. from his @entity3 hospital bed , @entity135 , an independent video journalist , showed me footage in which he followed a high - ranking police general around the @entity140 train station as machine gun fire from @entity65 supporters echoed outside , asking the commander to do his job , to call in reinforcements			1
the general waved him aside while talking frantically on his mobile phone			0
the police appeared to arrive , then left a few minutes later			0
@entity135 's video footage ends when @entity65 supporters shoot him in the leg			1
on the morning of july 8 i passed through @entity150 where the organizers of @entity152 , who mobilized the initial protests on june 30 that brought millions into the streets , had called for a sit - in			1
i saw police officers handing out juice boxes and snacks to passersby alongside a vehicle emblazoned with the slogan , " @entity10			0
" i arrived at the @entity163 a short while later to find the sting of tear gas still in the air and the sound of sporadic gunfire			0
witnesses said that the army and @entity173 ( riot police ) officers had opened fire on the crowd after trying to break up their sit - in			0
while some of the protesters had guns , witnesses said , and three security officers died , the protesters for the most part responded with rocks and @entity186 cocktails			0
with 51 protesters dead and more than 400 injured , it was among the deadliest days of security force violence since @entity190 stepped down			0
calls to hold the @entity65 to account are at a fever pitch , and the military - installed government has issued arrest warrants for more than 300 @entity65 members			1
but there is little appetite among @entity16 's transitional authorities for the essential task of investigating the police or the military for deaths they have caused , or for the badly needed reforms in the security sector			1
as foreign governments wring their hands , private citizens across the political spectrum are arming up , to dangerous effect , and people are dying again in @entity16 's streets and squares			1
those governments need to use what leverage they have to push urgently for credible impartial investigations and accountability for crimes by all parties , police and army as well as protesters			0
such steps are the only way to pull @entity16 back from the brink , and to rebuild trust in its battered and discredited state institutions			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			2

@entity230 saw ebullient @entity16 , in *solidarity* with police , in streets june 30
she says police have not reformed brutal ways of pre- 2011 protests ; they remain
she says police aim violence at @entity65 backers , do *n't* intervene in protest conflicts
@entity230 : people dying in @entity16 's streets ; world must hold *attackers* accountable
