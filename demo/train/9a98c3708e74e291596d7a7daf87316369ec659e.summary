-- judging by the 5 a.m. call i got yesterday from a national news network , and from the barrage of in - print , online and televised discussion i saw as the day wore on , it is clear that the revelation that rep. @entity9 is being treated at a " residential treatment facility " for a mood disorder has raised far more questions than it has answered			1
the key issues in the media debate / discussion appear to be : what is a mood disorder , and would the treatment of a mood disorder really require prolonged treatment at a residential facility ? being told someone has a mood disorder is a little bit like learning someone has cancer			1
there is no such thing as " cancer , " only specific types of cancer , which vary hugely from one another in location , symptoms and prognosis and need for treatment			0
like cancer , " mood disorder " is a general term for a group of disorders that can vary widely in terms of symptoms , prognosis and treatment			1
a mood disorder can be a mild depressive episode that sends a high - functioning person to a counselor for support and guidance , or it can be a florid psychotic episode that lands a previously law - abiding citizen in jail , or worse			1
if the congressman were in a hospital being treated for cancer , our sense of decorum might restrain us from digging deeper into the issue			0
but if we did dig , we 'd want to know what kind of cancer he had , what his prognosis was ( will he recover or die , and if the latter when ) , what kind of treatment he will need and how this treatment will impact his ability to serve in the government			0
@entity74 : @entity9 should take all the time he needs people are notoriously less restrained in their curiosity about psychiatric disease than cancer , but the questions are the same			2
in relation to the congressman we want to know what kind of mood disorder he has , what is the likelihood he 'll recover , what treatment will he need and how will the illness and his treatment impact his ability to work			1
of course , we have no idea what kind of mood disorder he has , so all i can do here is give a brief outline of what kind of mood disorder he might have			1
in mood disorders , the overriding symptoms are all tied to disturbances in how people feel			1
most of us spend our lives in moderate moods , but most of us have also experienced some mood extremes -- those times when we 've felt profoundly down or depressed and other times when we 've felt remarkably excited and euphoric			2
mood disorders exist at these extremes of thought and feeling			1
they have two additional characteristics			0
first , they are characterized by mood states that are more intense than people normally experience in their daily lives			2
second , mood disorders are conditions in which mood gets stuck			1
while most of us feel better or worse based on what 's happening in our lives , but always within limits , people with serious mood disorders often remain frozen in states of profound despair or unrealistic euphoria for extended periods			1
the vast majority of people with mood disorders will only experience depressive episodes			1
although estimates vary , somewhere between 20 % and 40 % of people living in the modern world will have at least one episode of major depression in their lifetime			2
many people who have a first episode will go on to have repeated episodes with the passage of time			2
depressive episodes are true mind - body experiences : people feel down , blue , sad or frightened and they lose pleasure in life , but they also experience physical / bodily symptoms such as sleep and appetite changes , fatigue and often physical aches and pains			0
a small minority of people with mood disorders will have a manic episode			1
unlike depression , which all of us understand to some degree or other from our own experience , a full mania is a shocking thing to see			0
with one or two exceptions , all the most outrageous things i 've seen as a psychiatrist ( and i 've seen many shocking sites ) occurred in the context of manic episodes			1
manic people do the most astounding and bizarre things imaginable			0
and many people in the grips of mania have assured me that i could have no idea of how they were thinking and feeling			0
i think this is true			0
mania starts at the happiest , the most excited , the most grandiose you 've ever felt and just goes straight up from there			0
manic people often feel incredibly euphoric and energized			0
they talk constantly at high speeds			0
they feel incredibly important and powerful			0
from this perspective they take terrible chances and do foolish things , believing everything will work to their favor			0
when things get really intense they often begin hearing voices , not infrequently the voice of @entity197 , and they develop delusions about their place in the world			0
for example , i 've had manic patients believe they were @entity204 , the @entity205 , @entity207 's girlfriend and @entity208			0
if you 've watched your own moods closely , you may have noticed that after times of especially high spirits you might be more prone than usual to irritability			0
this same phenomenon rules within the world of manias			0
even when euphoric , most manic patients are dangerously irritable if they are opposed by others			0
and with time , most euphoric episodes morph into states of rage and displeasure			0
this may account for the fact that people are more likely to commit suicide when manic than when depressed			0
as i 've said , many people with mood disorders only have depressions , and this disease pattern is often referred to as " unipolar depression			1
" on the other hand , almost everyone who has a manic episode also will have depressions , and in fact likely will have far more depressive than manic episodes			1
for this reason , people with manias and depressions are diagnosed as having " bipolar disorder , " a condition also known as manic - depression			1
a small minority of people ( mostly men ) will only have manias , but modern psychiatry has no special category for these " unipolar manic " folks -- they are considered to have bipolar disorder on the bet that sooner or later a depression will creep into the mix. both unipolar major depression and bipolar disorder have been shown to benefit from similar types of psychotherapy			1
on the other hand , different pharmacological strategies are usually required for bipolar and unipolar mood disorders			1
antidepressants are the mainstay of medical treatment for unipolar major depression			2
on the other hand , many patients with bipolar disorder actually seem to do worse when treated with antidepressants and respond preferentially to medications that stabilize mood and / or reduce psychotic symptoms			2
classic examples of mood stabilizers are lithium and valproic acid			0
multiple new and older anti-psychotic agents are available for the treatment of bipolar disorder			2
these agents are very effective in reducing mania and in protecting against new mood episodes , but generally are not as effective in treating the depressions that bedevil people with bipolar disorder			1
the prognosis for people with mood disorders serious enough to need hospitalization is not particularly good			1
our best studies suggest that 10 % to 15 % of these people will eventually commit suicide			0
most people with serious unipolar depression and almost everyone with bipolar disorder will experience repeated episodes or chronic symptoms across their lives , even with adequate treatment			1
these episodes and symptoms frequently wreak havoc on occupational and social functioning			0
for reasons we are just now beginning to understand , mood disorders also take a terrible toll on health			1
people with mood disorders earlier in life are at increased risk later in life for many of the modern world 's most lethal medical disorders			2
some studies suggest people with bipolar disorder live almost 10 years less than people without mood disorders			1
let me end this piece with a final comment regarding the specifics of @entity9 's treatment			2
the fact that he is in a " residential facility " has spawned a good deal of media discussion , most of it based around the fact that mood disorders are supposedly not treated in such facilities , but that substance abuse frequently is			2
i 've heard pundits say that this means either that @entity9 is actually in a psychiatric hospital and being euphemistic about his current accommodations or that he really is struggling with substance abuse and claiming a mood disorder as a way to avoid the stigma associated with drug and alcohol addictions			1
in fact , there are a number of high - end residential psychiatric facilities in the @entity352 that do treat mood disorders , and -- in my experience -- do so very well for people who can afford a high price tag that is almost never covered by insurance			2
these facilities will frequently keep very ill patients for a month or more			0
so this one aspect of @entity9 's story need not surprise or confuse us .			2

it is not known which mood disorder rep. @entity9 may have
many with mood disorders only have depressions , which is called " unipolar depression "
others have " bipolar depression , " which *includes* manic episodes
