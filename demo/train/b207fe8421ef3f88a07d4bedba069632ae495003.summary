-- the gun lobby is fiercely , and so far successfully , blocking what easily could be the greatest technological breakthrough to catching killers and deterring others			0
the simple method allows bullet manufacturers to stamp a numeric code on shell casings that would make it very easy to identify the gun that fired the shot			1
but the @entity12 is lobbying against states enacting laws to require such " microstamping			1
" the gun lobby is likely to prevail , given that in 2008 -- for the first time in @entity20 legal history -- the @entity17 interpreted that the @entity21 guaranteed an individual 's right to own guns for personal use , rather than as the tools of a " well - regulated militia			1
" the 2008 case , championed by the @entity12 , was the @entity29			1
the @entity17 then struck down a strict @entity31 law banning handgun ownership			1
this , and a subsequent ruling in 2010 , effectively tied the hands of state and federal governments in enacting any reasonable gun - related laws			1
in 2008 , justice @entity40 , writing for the typical 5 to 4 conservative majority , argued the first clause of the @entity21 -- " a well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state " -- merely offered one reason the founders sought to maintain the right to own firearms and that the main clause " codified a pre-existing right			1
" the decision was " a radical break from 70 years of @entity17 precedent , " according to an op - ed in the @entity54			1
although @entity29 applied only to federal law , the 2010 decision in @entity58 v. @entity59 asserted that the individual right to bear arms is a fundamental right , and thus the court 's ruling in @entity29 could apply to strike down state and local laws as well			1
" never in history has a federal court invalidated a law regulating the private ownership of firearms on @entity21 grounds , " said none other than @entity69 , solicitor general in the @entity71 administration and former dean of @entity73			2
" indeed , that the @entity21 poses no barrier to strong gun laws is perhaps the most well - settled proposition in @entity20 constitutional law			1
" opinion : do n't be nosy about @entity85 the key @entity17 cases establishing the precedent are @entity20 v. @entity88 ( 1875 ) , @entity89 ( 1886 ) , @entity90 v. @entity91 ( 1894 ) and @entity92 ( 1939 )			2
though the details of these cases vary , and like all such cases they are subject to different readings , the decisions reached in all of them fundamentally affirm that the @entity99 does not limit the states ' ability to restrict private gun ownership			2
in @entity92 , the case most often cited , @entity90 had not properly registered his sawed - off shotgun , nor had he paid a tax for transporting this weapon in interstate commerce , both required under the @entity109			0
@entity90 claimed the act violated his @entity21 rights			2
the court ruled that because @entity90 could not prove that his shotgun had " some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well - regulated militia , we can not say that the @entity21 guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument			2
" in the 1875 case , @entity122 , members of the @entity121 were charged with infringing on black citizens ' right to bear arms			0
the court ruled that although the @entity99 prevents the government from infringing on that right , it does not apply to citizens ' interactions with one another and charged that " ' bearing arms for a lawful purpose ' ... is not a right granted by the @entity99			0
" @entity89 ( 1886 ) reaffirmed the court 's ruling in @entity138			0
in this case , participants in a paramilitary organization were arrested for conducting parades and weapons drills without permission			0
the court ruled that states have the right to prohibit citizens from forming private militias and that the @entity21 " is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government , " meaning that state governments are free to legislate as they choose regarding guns			2
similarly , in @entity90 v. @entity91 ( 1894 ) , regarding a man who was convicted of murder with an unlicensed handgun , the court ruled that the @entity21 does not apply to state laws , calling it " well settled " that the @entity21 " operate [ s ] only upon the federal power and [ has ] no reference whatsoever to proceedings in state courts			2
" the @entity20 has more gun - related deaths than any other industrialized country			1
the rate of gun - related death in the @entity20 is more than double that of the next - highest industrialized country and eight times more than the average of its economic peers , according to data from the @entity179 's firearms and @entity180			1
the @entity20 firearms mortality rate is more than 70 times higher than industrialized @entity183 countries , like @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
an average of 32,300 @entity20 died each year from gun - related injuries between 1980 and 2006			1
among the many victims are children whose parents own guns to protect themselves against intruders			0
as someone who has experience using guns , i suggest that most homemakers are more likely to be killed in a gunbattle with an intruder than to kill him			0
it is ridiculous to argue that criminals kill people , not guns			0
nor could @entity205 have killed 32 people and injured 18 others at @entity208 with a knife instead of handguns			0
i realize that the majority of the @entity17 is a conservative one and that the court very rarely reverses itself			0
however , this law enables the gun lobby to promote extreme positions			0
is it too much to even hope that justices might revisit the 2008 decision and do what is right -- establish that the government has not just a right but a duty to regulate guns and ammunition ? then we might even get the gun lobby to drop its opposition to stamping a tiny numeric code on shell casings			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			0

@entity232 : stamping code on shell casings makes it easy for police to @entity239 gun that fired shot
@entity12 is fighting method and could win because of 2008 @entity17 ruling , he writes
@entity232 : @entity17 ignored 70 years of precedent and guaranteed individual right to be armed
this @entity21 ruling hampers states making any gun - related law , he says
