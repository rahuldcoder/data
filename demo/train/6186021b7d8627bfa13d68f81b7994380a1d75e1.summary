-- companies involved in the sinking of the offshore drilling rig @entity5 made " some very major mistakes , " interior secretary @entity1 said thursday after meeting with executives from the oil company @entity8			1
@entity1 would not elaborate , telling reporters in @entity10 , @entity11 , that the cause remains under investigation			1
but he said the failure of the rig 's blowout preventer -- a critical piece of equipment designed to shut off the flow of oil in an emergency -- was " a huge malfunction " that has left oil gushing into the @entity24			1
" the investigation will lead to conclusions about what exactly happened , but it did n't work the way it was supposed to work , " @entity1 said			1
" and from my own preliminary observations , there were some very major mistakes that were made by the companies that were involved			1
but today is not really the day to deal with those issues			0
" the @entity34 and the @entity36 's @entity35 are leading the investigation into the loss of the drill rig , owned by @entity8 contractor @entity40 the slick has been spreading across the northern @entity24 since late april , when the drilling rig @entity5 blew up and sank about 40 miles off the mouth of the @entity44			1
eleven missing workers who were aboard the rig are presumed dead			2
@entity8 owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick			0
efforts to shut down the well have failed , leaving it spewing about 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) of oil per day into the @entity24			1
there was no immediate response to @entity1 's comments from @entity8 , which has blamed @entity40			1
@entity1 's meeting with @entity8 executives -- his second trip to @entity10 in less than a week -- comes as oil washed ashore on @entity60 's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the @entity44			1
workers also prepared to lower a massive containment vessel over the @entity24 's two - week - old undersea gusher			1
have you been affected by the oil spill ? share your story , images a pinkish - orange foam mixture of seawater and crude oil streaked across large stretches of water in the northern @entity24 and turned up in the on the shores of the @entity74 , off southeastern @entity60			1
trace amounts of sheen had been reported on the shores of southeastern @entity60 over the past week , but the landfall reported thursday appeared to the " first impacts " of oil from the spill , @entity75 rear adm. @entity75 told reporters			2
@entity84 , chief operating officer for @entity8 , said mild weather gave cleanup crews more time to attack the spill			2
more controlled burns were conducted thursday , after @entity8 and the @entity34 used fire to destroy several thousand barrels of oil on the surface wednesday , he said			1
but the spill was spreading westward and is projected to drift toward coastal parishes past the @entity95 , spurring @entity60 to begin shifting preventive efforts to its southwestern coast , gov. @entity92 told reporters thursday			2
" that obviously opens up many more vulnerable areas along our coast , " @entity92 said			0
" we 're going to do everything we can to keep this oil out			2
" the @entity106 already has closed the area to fishing , restricting a multibillion - dollar industry in the region			0
@entity84 said @entity8 held a meeting with parish governments and state officials , who offered ideas for beating back the oily tide and leveled criticisms			0
" what 's clear is this is their home , " he said			0
" and what 's also clear is they 're passionate about protecting their home			0
" under federal law , @entity8 is responsible for capping the well and paying for the cleanup			0
the company shipped a four - story - high containment vessel to the site overnight and expected to lower it toward the seabed nearly a mile below the surface late thursday , @entity84 said			2
the hope is that the container will collect the leaking oil , which would be sucked up to a drill ship on the surface			1
if the operation is successful , @entity8 plans to deploy a second , smaller dome to deal with a second leak in the ruptured pipe			0
but getting the large structure into position could take several days , and the technique has never been attempted at the depth of these leaks			0
" if all goes according to plan by early next week we hope to make it operational , " @entity84 said			0
" as we always do , though , we stress this has never been done before			0
we 'll likely encounter numerous challenges , but we 'll remain committed to make it work			0
" @entity8 has stopped the flow of oil from one of the three existing leak points from the sunken rig , but it was the smallest of the three leaks and did not affect the amount of crude pouring into the ocean			2
@entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0

firms involved in rig 's sinking made " very major mistakes , " @entity1 says
@entity34 scrambles to clean up first patch of oil known to reach shore
containment dome arrives on site above source of massive oil spill
officials hope dome will capture oil leaking 5,000 feet beneath @entity24
