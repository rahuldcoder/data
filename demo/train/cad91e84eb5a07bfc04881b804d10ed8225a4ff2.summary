@entity0 -- the @entity2 had difficulty electing its principal chief , so much so that members called in the @entity6 to observe the most recent vote and judge whether it was free and fair			1
we normally observe elections only in politically troubled countries abroad but believe that the contentiousness and fundamental voting rights issues at stake -- and not just for the @entity15 -- justified this exceptional mission			1
simmering beneath the election process all along has been the crucial issue of voting rights for the former slaves known in the tribe as @entity22 , who are @entity15 citizens of @entity25 origin and who have had to fight in the courts to be able to vote			1
cherokees , formerly of @entity29 and now mostly in @entity31 , number about 300,000 , 56,000 of whom are registered voters			0
about 15,200 turned out for an election in june			0
after four attempts to certify the winner in the contest between incumbent principal chief @entity39 and challenger @entity40 , the @entity35 set a rerun vote vote for september 24 , which the @entity6 observed			2
in march 2007 , a referendum â € ” in which only 8,700 ballots were cast -- denied tribal citizenship to anyone who did not have at least one ancestor on the 1867 @entity50 government 's @entity48			0
most of the disenfranchised were the nearly 3,000 @entity52			0
@entity50 authorities had deemed their ancestors not ethnic @entity15 but among the 5,000 survivors of the 17,000 expelled from @entity29 and sent on the " @entity56 " to @entity31			1
@entity57 had listed them separately as full members of the @entity15 nation			2
the @entity22 defied the exclusion , claimed their full rights and voted in june			2
but in august , before the rerun , the @entity35 issued a second ruling , affirming that the march referendum was constitutional			0
@entity39 had championed the 2007 referendum and , not surprisingly , praised the affirmation of @entity35 , whose members he had appointed			0
because of that , many believed the court ruling was rooted more in political opportunism -- to assure more votes for @entity39 over @entity40 -- than legal principles			0
their legal counsel appealed to @entity76 district judge @entity75 to stay the @entity77 ruling september 20 , and this , along with a decision by the @entity79 to freeze $ 31 million in much - needed housing funds , succeeded in restoring the @entity22 's voting rights in the september 24 runoff			1
when the @entity2 appealed to @entity6 to observe this election , we saw a likelihood of another very close election between two increasingly bitter factions competing for control of a @entity15 administration with rapidly growing assets : up 243 % since 2002 , mostly because of casino gambling			1
last year , the administration had revenues of about $ 420 million			0
but what made this election far more significant than a contest for political power and wealth was the voting rights of the @entity22			1
democracy 's defining principle is inherent equality			0
the terrible history of forced oppression and forced relocation has produced a deeply flawed @entity15 democracy , one further threatened by the attempt to restrict citizenship to ethnic @entity15 , a flagrant affront to the principle of inherent equality			1
we observed the voting september 24 and the additional five days allowed at the election commission 's headquarters in @entity115 , @entity31 , with the final voting october 8			2
the elections commission declared @entity40 the winner in an election @entity6 deemed to be transparent and an accurate reflection of the will of the cherokee people , including the @entity22			1
the @entity15 election is significant because the vote was credible , and more important , for the rejection of ethnic nationalism as a route to democratic development			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			0

@entity131 : @entity2 called in @entity6 to observe its election for chief
adding to power struggle was the right of @entity22 ( black @entity15 ) to vote , he says
*freedmen* , @entity15 members of @entity25 origin , fought and finally won right to vote
@entity131 : restricting voting rights to ethnic @entity15 is an affront to democracy
