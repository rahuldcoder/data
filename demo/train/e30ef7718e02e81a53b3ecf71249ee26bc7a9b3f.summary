-- carefully maneuvering around a jumble of slippery rocks , @entity1 slowly steps inside a cluster of dark caves in northeast @entity6			1
ahead of him , leading the trail with an air of assurance , walks a local witchdoctor			0
aided by a couple of artificial lights , the two figures venture deeper into the darkness , running their hands along the cavern 's limestone walls for guidance			2
bats meandering above their heads , the men enter a vast cave chamber dotted with a handful of rocks			0
" what i want to know is , " @entity1 breaks the silence , " have you ever seen anyone pray for something evil down here ? " he asks the witchdoctor			1
" so they can get hold of someone ? like an albino ? " an albino himself , @entity1 has been traveling around @entity6 to debunk the widespread misconceptions about the congenital disorder			1
dozens of albinos have been mutilated and slaughtered in the country in recent years , because of rumors being spread that their body parts can bring wealth and good luck			1
read this : witchcraft in @entity6 to stop the atrocities , @entity1 thought he needed to confront the group he believed was the source of these rumors : witchdoctors			1
and that 's what brought him to the depths of this cave , face to face with his " enemy			0
" " we call you a spirit because a white person like you is the devil , " readily admits the witchdoctor			0
" you 're saying i 'm a white demon ? " @entity1 hits back , " we are demons ? " the reply : " yes , because you 're white			1
" @entity67 ' this dramatic confrontation is one of the most intense moments captured in a new documentary , called " in the @entity72 " the independent film , shot by director @entity74 , chronicles the life story of @entity1 and his fight for acceptance of albinos in a country where little is known about the genetic disorder			1
" my heart always is still looking the recognition of people with albinism in this world , " says @entity1 , who 's been an advocate for albino rights since 2004			1
" just to recognize that we are here			0
" @entity1 and @entity74 spent six years creating the film			1
the director 's inspiration to make a documentary on albinism came nearly a decade ago , when he had one of his first encounters with someone with the disorder in @entity97			1
" a woman approached me in the street , held out her child and said ' here , take it back , where it comes from , " remembers @entity74			0
" she had a child with albinism and because i 'm white , she thought the child belonged to me in some way -- her husband had left her for having a white child and accused her of sleeping with a white man			0
" leading man people with albinism are born with genes that do not make the normal amounts of the pigment called melanin			0
those born with the disorder , which affects people from all races , inherited the genes from their parents who may or may not have any of the associated traits			0
but many people do n't understand the effects of the condition and as @entity74 discovered , in parts of @entity129 albinos often suffer social stigma , prejudice and even attacks			1
read this : slave trade ghost town @entity136 to make a film documenting the plight of this group of people , @entity74 headed to @entity6 , the country reported to have one of the biggest albino populations in the world			1
there , he came across many amazing stories , but he did n't find his leading man until he met @entity1			2
" i just heard him speak and instantly , i just knew he was the one to lead the film , " says @entity74			0
" i think so many stories that come out of @entity129 are negative , and everything about @entity1 is positive			2
" despite growing up with a disorder that left his skin and hair pale , as well as his strength and eye sight weak , @entity1 has succeeded in making the best of his situation			2
over the years , he 's overcome struggles and discrimination to receive an education and get married			2
a father of two , @entity1 ' has even climbed @entity129 's tallest mountain , @entity162 , to prove that albinos can achieve greatness			1
" it was really very difficult to climb , " he admits			0
" but i was climbing because at that time i had an agenda behind for what is happening to this world , " he adds			0
" we are killed , we are hunted , we are chopped			0
so i climbed with a special message ... to the @entity129 countries : that we are able			0
but [ also ] protect us , give us a chance , do n't stigmatize , do n't isolate , do n't hide us to the darkness room -- just open the way			0
" ' why are they killing us ? ' in 2009 , the @entity6 government embarked on a campaign against the killers of albinos , particularly in the @entity181 region			1
@entity74 says at the heart of the problem are witch doctors making claims that albino body parts can bring wealth			1
" in @entity6 , there 's been 72 reported people with albinism killed over the last five years , " says @entity74 , noting that the actual number could be higher			1
" and there 's been 34 people left mutilated that have survived attacks			0
" some of the victims were people @entity1 used to know			2
" i was angry , " says @entity1 , recalling the moments following his confrontation with the witchdoctor			2
" he answered it to me directly , without even trying to hide anything			0
so i was angry , of course , because i remember my brothers and sisters whom i lost , because i will not see them forever and while he 's there he 's continually surviving , " he adds			0
" so , you ask yourself , ' what 's the problem ? why are they killing us ? why are they hunting us ? ' " @entity1 realizes he may never get a suitable answer to those questions			1
yet , this does n't stop him from doing all he can to bring attention to his message of creating a more inclusive society			0
he hopes that his community work and the documentary focusing on his efforts , coupled with the outreach from other organizations and the government , will eventually make @entity6 a place where albinos are n't forced to stay in the shadows			1
" it 's my dream in my life that people with albinism are respected and given all rights which other human beings are being given , " he says			2
" this is what is in my heart -- when i would see justice to people with albinism ; when i would see the lifespan of people with albinism is increasing , this is still a dream to my life			2

in recent years , there 's been an increase in the deaths of albinos in @entity6
at the heart of the problem , are rumors that albinos ' body parts can bring wealth and good luck
@entity1 has been spreading *awareness* about albinism in @entity6
his efforts have been captured in the documentary " in the @entity262 "
