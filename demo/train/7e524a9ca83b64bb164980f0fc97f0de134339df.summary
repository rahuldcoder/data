@entity1 director @entity0 apologized to the @entity2 on thursday and admitted the agency spied on computers used by its staffers who prepared an investigation of the controversial post 9/11 @entity1 interrogation and detention program			1
the episode was the subject of an unusual , public dispute between the panel and the spy agency over access to classified information			0
the @entity1 had accused the committee staffers of getting access to internal agency documents and of improperly handling classified material			1
the @entity22 looked into it at the request of the @entity1 and decided there was n't enough evidence of a crime to warrant further investigation			1
@entity29 weighs in but the @entity1 's inspector general , a watchdog , found that some agency employees " acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding " reached between the intelligence panel and the @entity1 in 2009 regarding access to information , the @entity1 said in a statement			1
" the director subsequently informed the ( committee ) chairman and vice chairman of the findings and apologized to them for such actions by @entity1 officers as described in the ( inspector general 's ) report , " the statement said			1
" the director is committed to correcting any shortcomings related to this matter " and is commissioning an @entity52 to be chaired by former @entity55 @entity54 senator and @entity2 member @entity56 , the @entity1 said			1
" this board will review the ( inspector general 's ) report , conduct interviews as needed , and provide the director with recommendations that , depending on its findings , could include potential disciplinary measures and / or steps to address systemic issues			1
the intelligence panel report could be released to the public as soon as next week , congressional sources from each party said this week			1
@entity70 , a @entity71 of @entity72 and the vice chairman of the @entity2 , said he was disappointed by the whole thing			0
" obviously this is a very serious situation and these are serious violations			0
the individuals who breached the ( committee ) computer , i think , are going to have to be dealt with , i think , very harshly by the @entity1 , " he said			2
" but it 's in the director 's hands			0
" report to be released the document is a nearly 700 - page summary of the full 6,800 - page report that was approved a year and a half ago by the committee , which was sharply divided along party lines			0
senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the @entity1 's treatment of terrorism suspects saying it amounted to torture , something @entity1 officials have denied			2
it also finds that harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future attacks as many in intelligence community have claimed			0
the documents that prompted the dispute related to an internal review by former cia director @entity106 and , according to the agency , were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee for its investigation of the program			0
the documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee , according to the @entity1			2
@entity2 chairman @entity116 said @entity2 staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error , and that they corroborated some of the committee 's findings that the agency now says it disagrees with			2
she said committee staff routinely sees such documents and did n't violate any classified restrictions .			0
