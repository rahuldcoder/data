@entity3 intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks around the world for years , apparently targeting fat data pipes that push immense amounts of data around the @entity9 , @entity1 leaker @entity0 told the @entity10 on wednesday			1
among some 61,000 reported targets of the @entity1 , @entity0 said , are hundreds of computers in @entity13 -- which @entity3 officials have increasingly criticized as the source of thousands of attacks on @entity3 military and commercial networks			1
@entity13 has denied such attacks			2
the @entity10 said it had seen documents provided by @entity0 but was unable to verify their authenticity			2
the @entity25 news agency , which operates in @entity26 , also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of @entity3 hacking of networks in @entity26 and mainland @entity13 since 2009			1
@entity0 told the paper that some of the targets included the @entity34 , public officials and students			1
the documents also " point to hacking activity by the @entity1 against mainland targets , " the newspaper reported			2
the claims came just days after @entity3 president @entity43 pressed @entity13 president @entity44 to address cyberattacks emanating from @entity13 that @entity43 described as " direct theft of @entity3 property			1
" @entity0 's allegations appear to give weight to claims by some @entity13 government officials that the country has been a victim of similar hacking efforts coming from the @entity3			1
his claims came as gen. @entity56 , the @entity1 chief , testified at a @entity58 hearing that the country 's cyberinfrastructure , including telephones and computer networks , is somewhat vulnerable to attack			1
on a scale of one to 10 , " our critical infrastructure 's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyberattack is about a three , based on my experience , " he said			0
in the @entity10 interview -- published one week after the @entity72 newspaper @entity71 revealed the first leaks attributed to @entity0 -- he claimed the agency he once worked for as a contractor typically targets high - bandwidth data lines that connect @entity9 nodes located around the world			1
" we hack network backbones -- like huge internet routers , basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one , " the newspaper quoted him as saying			0
a " backbone " is part of the inner workings of a computer network that links different parts of that network			0
it is used to deliver data from one part of the network to another and , as such , could expose data from multiple computers if hacked			0
' trying to bully ' @entity0 , 29 , worked for the @entity99 computer consulting firm until monday , when he was fired after documents he provided to journalists revealed the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity3 and the internet activity of overseas residents			1
while he has not been charged , the @entity108 is conducting an investigation into the leaks , and he has told @entity71 that he expects the @entity3 will try to prosecute him			2
@entity0 told the @entity10 that he felt @entity3 officials were pressuring his family and also accused them of " trying to bully " @entity26 into extraditing him to prevent the release of more damaging information			1
he vowed to resist extradition efforts if it comes to that , saying he " would rather stay and fight the @entity3 government in the courts , because i have faith in @entity26 's rule of law			1
" " my intention is to ask the courts and people of @entity26 to decide my fate , " the @entity10 quoted @entity0 as saying			2
" i have been given no reason to doubt your system			0
'' but @entity26 lawmaker @entity131 , a former secretary of security for the territory , said tuesday that while any extradition process could take months , @entity0 is n't necessarily beyond the reach of the @entity3			1
" if he thought there was a legal vacuum in @entity26 which renders him safe from @entity3 jurisdiction , that is unlikely to be the case , " she said			2
the newspaper said @entity0 has been hiding in undisclosed locations inside the semi-autonomous @entity13 territory since checking out of his hotel room monday -- a day after he revealed his identity in an interview with @entity71			1
@entity0 told the @entity10 he is not trying to evade @entity3 authorities			1
" people who think i made a mistake in picking @entity26 as a location misunderstand my intentions , " the newspaper quoted him as saying			0
" i am not here to hide from justice ; i am here to reveal criminality			0
" the @entity1 and the national intelligence director did not immediately respond to a @entity158 request for comment			2
asked during a media briefing on wednesday for comment on @entity0 's latest claims , @entity161 spokeswoman @entity160 declined			1
she said she had not seen the latest @entity10 report			0
on the defensive the revelations have renewed debate over surveillance in the @entity3 and overseas in the name of fighting terrorism , with supporters saying the programs revealed by @entity0 are legal and have helped stop terror plots			1
civil liberties advocates , however , call the measures dangerous and unacceptable intrusions			0
such criticisms have put @entity43 and his allies on the issue -- both @entity181 and @entity182 -- on the defensive against mounting criticisms from a similarly bipartisan group of critics demanding changes to rein in the programs			0
there also is a sharp division among @entity3 over the issue			2
a @entity192 poll released wednesday found that 44 % of @entity3 believe @entity0 did the right thing by releasing details about the classified surveillance programs , while 42 % said it was wrong and 14 % said they were unsure			1
the poll for that question had a 6 % margin of error			0
it also found that more @entity3 disapprove than approve of the government 's surveillance programs , 53 % to 37 %			2
ten percent had no opinion			0
the poll for that question had a 4 % margin of error			0
those differences were on display wednesday when @entity56 , the director of the @entity1 , testified at a hearing into cybersecurity technology and civil liberties			2
officials have been unable to explain controversial data mining programs because they have been classified , @entity56 testified			0
but @entity56 rejected the @entity0 's claim that the @entity1 could tap into any @entity3 's phone or computer			1
" i know of no way to do that , " @entity56 said			0
but he testified that phone records obtained by the government helped prevent " dozens " of terrorist events			0
he would not discuss disrupted plots broadly , saying they were classified			0
but he did say federal data mining appeared to play a role in helping to disrupt a plot in recent years to attack the @entity231 subway system			0
@entity56 said information developed overseas was passed along to the @entity108 , which he said was able to identify eventual suspect @entity233 in @entity234 and ultimately uncover a plot			0
@entity233 pleaded guilty to terror - related charges in 2010			0
while not on the roster for wednesday 's hearing , another administration official in the spotlight is director of national intelligence @entity241 , whom @entity181 sen. @entity243 has singled out for how he answered questions about the telephone surveillance program in march			0
in march , @entity243 asked @entity241 whether the @entity1 collects " any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of @entity3 ? " " no sir , " @entity241 said			1
on saturday , @entity241 told @entity248 that he answered in the " most truthful or least most untruthful manner " possible			0
@entity241 told @entity248 that he had interpreted " collection " to mean actually examining the materials gathered by the @entity1			2
he previously told the @entity252 he had meant that " the @entity1 does not voyeuristically pore through @entity3 citizens ' e-mails , " but he did not mention e-mails at the hearing			1
@entity1 leaker 's girlfriend says she 's ' lost at sea ' @entity261 questions fallout over revelations about the @entity1 's intelligence - gathering has reached the @entity261 's governing body , where vice president @entity266 raised concerns that the @entity3 may have targeted some of its citizens			1
@entity266 said she plans to raise the issue during a meeting friday with @entity3 attorney general @entity272			2
" the respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law are the foundations of the @entity261 - @entity3 relationship			1
this common understanding has been , and must remain , the basis of cooperation between us in the area of @entity284 , " @entity266 , the @entity261 commissioner for justice , said wednesday			1
" trust that the rule of law will be respected is also essential to the stability and growth of the digital economy , including transatlantic business			0
this is of paramount importance for individuals and companies alike			0
