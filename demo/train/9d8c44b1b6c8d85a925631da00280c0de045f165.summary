@entity0 -- @entity2 has a female prime minister			1
@entity2 also has a shock jock commercial radio broadcaster and his name is @entity10			1
his dislike of the prime minister is as legendary as his typically adoring , right - wing retiree listeners are loyal			1
the two have been involved in an almighty collision that is proving commercially and politically disastrous for @entity10 and a likely polling gift for @entity5			1
@entity10 is a former coach of the @entity19 team who sought @entity22 pre-selection in the late 1970s			2
he is also a determined climate change denier who 13 years ago was investigated over allegations of accepting commercial support from companies in exchange for favorable comment			0
despite this , the take - no - prisoner broadcaster remains one of @entity2 's most popular and highly paid radio announcers			1
since she snatched the premiership from @entity35 in 2010 , @entity5 claims she has been the target of persistent misogynist invective and otherwise abusive treatment that some commentators agree would not have been directed at a male incumbent			1
if not her hair , then her distinctive drawl , physical attributes , and dress style have attracted negative comment in mainstream press and on social media , along with her de facto relationship with @entity49 , a former hairdresser who is now in real estate			0
however , in the past week , the disrespect flew off the @entity52 and the culprit was @entity10			2
having ruled the airwaves for more than two decades with a very large , if aging audience , @entity10 has enraged and offended much of @entity2			1
he took aim at the most tender and raw of emotions : the prime minister 's palpable grief at the recent death of her beloved father , @entity63 , after a long illness			1
" the old man died a few weeks ago of shame , " @entity10 told a gathering of the @entity66 a week ago			1
" to think that he had a daughter who told lies every time she stood for @entity80 , " he is heard saying on a recording of the event taken by a journalist from @entity74 's @entity73 paper @entity75			0
the " lie " @entity10 referred to was prime minister @entity5 's promise before the 2010 election that no government she led would introduce a carbon tax			1
however , @entity5 abandoned her stance when the election produced a hung parliament			2
@entity10 has led several anti-carbon tax rallies and he has said that the prime minister should be better known as @entity90			1
he has suggested the guillotine be brought back to deal with her and that she be thrown to the sea in a chaff bag			0
later he claimed that @entity5 , along with a handful of other female political leaders , was " destroying the joint			2
" @entity10 claims his attacks on @entity5 are squarely aimed at her policies , but some commentators , and @entity5 herself , suspect that his barbs have more to do with her gender			1
his claim that @entity5 's father died of shame was the last straw for campaigners on social media , many companies that advertise on @entity10 ' show and some regional radio stations that buy his daily show			1
a significant number of major companies , amongst them @entity116 and supermarket giant @entity118 , have pulled valuable advertising from his show			0
on its @entity126 profile , in response to a social media campaign , home wares store @entity121 noted : " you spoke , we listened			0
we do not support the comments made by @entity10			2
we have pulled our advertising off the air			0
" those which have not yet withdrawn their advertising dollars from the network are under intense pressure to follow suit			0
@entity10 for his part has been less than contrite			2
in a rambling 45 - minute media conference the day after the content of his speech was made public , he insisted he was merely " repeating " a comment he had heard at a social function			0
he said he had phoned @entity5 to apologize , but she had refused to take his call			2
the prime minister said wednesday that she would n't be speaking to @entity10 , nor would she appear on his show			1
two days after apologizing , @entity10 was back on air and his followers were backing him all the way			1
even those who thought his comment offensive and distasteful threw their weight behind @entity10 : " i believe you were wrong in what you said , but i am so proud to have a man stand up and apologize , " one listener told him			2
condemnation from the prime minister 's @entity160 was swift			1
the leader of the opposition @entity162 - @entity162 , @entity163 , a staunch friend of @entity10 , issued a brief statement , saying " @entity10 's remarks regarding the @entity166 were completely out of line			1
" " it 's good that he 's recognized this and apologized for them , " he added			0
@entity163 now faces intense political pressure to go further and prevent @entity10 from attending any @entity22 functions			2
it has been a difficult few weeks for the @entity162 leader who , just a few weeks ago , was riding high in the polls			0
he has battled a perception that he has difficulty relating to women			0
he stands accused of being a misogynist himself over an alleged incident 30 years ago in which he 's alleged to have punched the wall behind a female candidate after she won a student council election			0
@entity163 denies the incident ever happened			0
what impact the @entity10 affair will have on his polling is yet to be seen			0
while many commentators believe the @entity5 's decision not to speak with @entity10 , on or off air , could result in a lift in the polls , others think if her cabinet supporters protest too loudly , the gains will be lost			1
a reader poll in one newspaper showed an overwhelming desire for @entity10 ' employer , the @entity199 , to sack him			0
and , at the time of writing , more than 100,000 people had signed an online petition calling for his dismissal			0
commentators say that it 's unlikely he 'll go			0
@entity10 is the company 's fourth largest shareholder and as stockbroker @entity210 told the @entity213 website : " his key listeners are over 55 , they are right wing			1
they agree with him that @entity5 is a bitch and witch			0
there is no mismatch between him and his listeners			0
" although the advertisers will likely return to the country 's highest rating broadcaster , they might at the very least have cause to question @entity10 ' dictum that it is women who are " destroying the joint			1
" @entity5 may prove the polls wrong too and end up running the joint for another three years after the 2013 election .			2

popular @entity2 shock jock @entity10 in clash with prime minister
just days after @entity5 's father 's death , @entity10 said he had " died of shame "
advertisers pulling funding from @entity10 ' radio show , online campaign calls for his sacking
commentators say outrage may give @entity5 an *unexpected* boost in the polls
