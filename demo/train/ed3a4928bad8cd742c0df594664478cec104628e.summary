-- while @entity2 has long been the de facto language of international business , more multinational companies are now mandating that employees communicate only in @entity2			1
according to @entity8 , a professor at @entity9 , companies that do n't adopt @entity2 as a standard for their entire organization will , at some point , " experience some form of bottleneck			1
" " it depends on what the company does , but if you 'll have members in different countries needing to collaborate -- whether it 's to integrate technology platforms or cater to customers worldwide -- it will become more important that even middle managers and employees with international assignments will need a common language in order to interface with others			1
" @entity30 , @entity32 - @entity31 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 have all mandated @entity2 as their corporate language , writes @entity8 in the may 2012 edition of @entity39 -- and she says more than 70 @entity41 companies have now migrated to @entity2			1
in 2010 , @entity44 internet services company @entity42 made headlines when it announced it would become an @entity2 - only organization , with all communication , verbal and email , in @entity2			1
" @entity2 is the only global language , " ceo @entity49 told @entity0 at the time			1
" we 're doing a global business			0
i think this is the only way a @entity44 service organization can become a global organization			2
" " if you want to become successful in other countries , you need to internationalize the headquarters , " he added			0
to help make the transition , @entity44 language signage was removed from cafeterias and elevators			1
@entity49 even conducts performance reviews with his @entity44 executives in @entity2 , according to @entity8			1
if this sounds bewildering for employees , it can be			0
two years into an @entity2 - only implementation at one company @entity8 studied , 70 % of employees reported feeling frustrated with the policy			1
that 's why she says businesses must plan carefully before implementing an @entity2 - only policy			2
" in the absence of language strategies , you see so many people getting hurt and diminished , " @entity8 says			0
" when a company announces a language change without any thought or preparation for employees , many people lose the promotional path that they 've spent their whole lives developing			1
" see also : is workplace boredom ' the new stress ? ' shifting a company 's entire operations into a new language is n't easy			2
but @entity8 , who has studied corporate language strategy for a decade , has some suggestions			1
companies need a clear , well - aligned strategy and " it needs to be supported and implemented at all levels of the organization , from the ceo down to the supervisor / manager of every employee who is subject to having to convert to a new language , " she says			2
off - the - rack tuition wo n't cut it			0
" @entity2 lessons alone are not enough , " @entity8 says			0
" if you have an aggressive environment where people work an extraordinary amount of hours and they 're challenged with goals , language vendors need to help make sure you 're capable of learning successfully while being successful at your job			0
" the best results come when instruction is customized to employees ' roles , with vocabulary geared specifically towards the types of emails they write , for instance			0
while some companies choose to become bilingual before adopting @entity2 wholesale , @entity8 says this is " incredibly expensive and unsustainable			1
" those with @entity2 as a first language need to make adjustments too			1
" native speakers need to learn how to dial themselves down and how to accommodate others , " @entity8 says			0
managers should adopt a zero - tolerance policy to backsliding , to make it clear that the change to @entity2 is not only possible but permanent			0
depending on the company 's size , resources and the aggressiveness of its pursuit of @entity2 , @entity8 estimates implementation is " a four to 10 - year odyssey " , with ongoing maintenance required thereafter			2
but she says the journey is worth it , pointing out that a company with @entity2 proficiency across the board has greater operational agility and " can serve all of their market seamlessly by using all of their human capital worldwide to achieve any end			2
" see also : is happiness the secret of success ? immediately after acquiring a @entity159 company , @entity42 was able to deploy seven of its top engineers to @entity161 , to begin integration processes , according to @entity8			2
" two years ago they could have never done that , " she says			0
" that shows the extent to which expertise and knowledge flows through the company in ways it would n't otherwise			0
" for individuals too , there are benefits			0
depending on their fluency and how far their career has advanced , an employee may experience performance anxiety and job insecurity when asked to work in a new language			1
but , @entity8 says , as fluency increases , the emotional strain diminishes and bilingualism becomes something enjoyable			0
" you also see them starting to shoot up in their careers , " @entity8 observes			0
" they begin to take on roles that require more and more communication in the @entity2 language			2

more companies mandating @entity2 as their corporate language , says @entity9 professor
@entity44 company @entity42 is among those that have gone " @entity2 only "
expert says employees can experience performance anxiety while making transition to @entity2
