-- let 's see how far this goes without making a dead parrot reference			2
@entity6 can not be stopped			0
and , apparently , not even contained			0
the five surviving members of the @entity9 - based renegade comedy troupe announced this week they were getting the band back together for live performances , their first together in more than a decade			1
in the funny business world , this is equivalent to the @entity14 getting back together			2
and the @entity15 , too			0
they 've never broken up exactly , have they ? rewind			0
) see what i just did ? i broke the pattern , digressed from form -- and did so with unapologetic silliness			1
if you want to know why this @entity25 get - together has aroused such good feeling from everyone , you have to begin by knowing that this is how @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 went about their business back when their @entity38 series began in 1969			1
the @entity39 stretched , tugged and bent the tv variety - revue format into shapes unimagined in the medium except by such @entity44 pioneers of surreal tv as @entity46			2
imagine , for instance , having three clueless and crass @entity49 inquisitors burst into an @entity51 drawing room for a routine and using them as a running gag through other routines on the same episode up to and including the closing credits			0
@entity25 did that bit and many more , using unlikely elements , like bicycle repairmen , hapless superheroes , dotty old ladies , bookshops with naughty dentists , cheese shops with dancing men in derby hats and lots and lots of @entity70			1
" @entity6 " made landfall -- or , rather , pratfall -- on @entity44 public television stations in the early 1970s , and its unapologetic anarchy and snide surrealism triumphed here			2
oh , there were some who did n't get the jokes , believing the blithe zaniness of the @entity39 ' humor to be irrelevant to the @entity82 and on behalf of women 's rights , black empowerment , gay pride and other white - hot issues of that polarized time			1
what these solemn spoilsports did n't , or could n't understand at the time is that sociopolitical conflicts come and go , but a dirty fork and a sissy lumberjack are things of lasting consequence and sublimity			0
those who were n't there at the time -- and you know who you are -- can see for yourselves what all the giggling was about thanks in large part to @entity106 's @entity105 , which the troupe initiated in 2008 as a site for showcasing its vintage @entity38 sketches as well as scenes from such classic @entity25 films as 1975 's " @entity25 and the @entity111 , " 1979 's " @entity112 " and 1983 's " @entity113			1
" with @entity25 faux grouchiness , the channel urged its viewers to " click on the links , buy our movies and tv shows , and soften our pain from being ripped off all these years			1
" they 're kidding , of course			0
at least , they seem to be			0
but i 'm speculating that one of the reasons the band is getting back together ( without @entity29 , who died in 1989 ) is partly to take advantage of this fresh wave of digital fans who 've never seen them act silly in public , but have likely wasted time at work or home watching the " @entity142 " routine in which @entity33 walks into an office seeking a pilot 's license and is instead goaded by @entity29 , suspended in midair , to flap his arms and jump off a desk ? or to watch @entity34 walk into a formal office in search of an argument and find himself in a pointless series of contradictions with a stuffy @entity30 ? or to watch those same two gentleman in riotous dispute over the sentience of a @entity152 blue parrot			1
... ( almost made it ! @entity154 ! ) the only question this week 's news offers is whether these now - septuagenarian crazy men are still limber enough to bring fresh surprises to the table			1
i 'm going to go with ... probably			0
which is the best i can do until i see for myself whether @entity33 and @entity34 can still work their old - lady outfits			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity166 : @entity25 's *reunion* will bring back its brand of unapologetic silliness
he says news is huge for fans of troupe 's @entity38 show and *popular* films
he says anarchic , boundary - breaking humor was n't always easy fit in social *turmoil* of ' 70s
@entity183 : *pythons* have found new fans on @entity106 , but will humor fly for 2013 *audience* ?
