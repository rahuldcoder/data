-- there is a one - word subtext to president @entity4 's trip to @entity5 : @entity6			1
after 9/11 , the @entity7 became embroiled in more than a decade of wars in @entity9 and the @entity10			0
as a result , @entity7 engagement in @entity12 and @entity5 largely atrophied			1
meanwhile , @entity6 saw an opportunity			0
@entity6 has now displaced the @entity7 as the largest trading partners of two key @entity12 countries , @entity17 and @entity18			2
@entity6 's economic rise is particularly marked in @entity5 ; it quietly surpassed the @entity7 as the continent 's largest trading partner four years ago			1
sino - @entity23 trade is now estimated to be $ 200 billion a year and is expected to rise to $ 325 billion in the next two years			2
while the conventional view has long been that @entity5 is largely a motley collection of economic basket cases , in fact , according to the most recent @entity31 figures , five out of 10 of the world 's fastest - growing economies are in @entity5			2
indeed , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 are the globe 's top three economic hot spots with projected 2013 growth rates of 32 % , 20 % and 17 % respectively			0
as if to underline the importance that the @entity6 see in @entity5 , within two weeks of assuming office in march 2013 , the new @entity6 president @entity38 visited two of the three @entity23 countries @entity4 will be visiting on his @entity23 trip , @entity44 and @entity5			1
@entity6 is the largest trading partner for both of those nations			0
read this : @entity4 ' plays catch up ' in @entity5 seemingly as a result of its substantial investments and trade in @entity5 , @entity6 is well liked on the continent			1
a 2007 @entity54 survey found 92 % of respondents held favorable views of @entity6 in the @entity57 and @entity58 , and between 67 % and 81 % held favorable views in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity44 and @entity64			0
@entity54 noted that these favorable views of @entity6 come at the expense of the @entity7 : " @entity6 's influence is almost universally viewed as having a more beneficial impact on @entity23 countries than does that of the @entity7			1
" in other words , the @entity7 has considerable catch up to play in @entity5			0
in 2012 then - secretary of state @entity71 toured @entity5 and made what many assumed to be a not - so - thinly veiled swipe at @entity6 , which is heavily involved in @entity23 mineral and oil extraction : " the days of having outsiders come and extract the wealth of @entity5 for themselves , leaving nothing or very little behind , should be over ... " @entity4 is likely to avoid any criticism of @entity6 but he has chosen to visit @entity61 , @entity44 and @entity5 , countries that are all relatively functional democracies , and he is likely to dwell on the issues of good governance and respect for human rights in his public remarks , which will serve to subtly remind @entity23 that these are issues that the @entity7 puts more value on than does @entity6			1
but the real message @entity4 will be signaling is that @entity12 is open for business with @entity5			1
in @entity44 , the president will have a closed meeting with some two - dozen leading @entity12 and @entity23 ceos			0
and , according to @entity101 , an expert on @entity5 at the @entity102 in @entity103 , " some 500 business leaders will join the president at various points in his trip to assess the opportunities for themselves			0
" perhaps they may conclude , as the @entity104 did last year , that " @entity5 could be on the brink of an economic takeoff , much like @entity6 was 30 years ago , and @entity107 20 years ago			2
" and if that happens , the @entity7 , of course , would want to be part of this story .			0
