-- @entity1 knows what it takes to win the @entity4 -- and the former @entity6 midfielder is tipping today 's generation to shine brightly in @entity9 's football showpiece this year			1
part of the @entity12 team which won the trophy on home soil in 1998 , @entity1 is confident the current crop can spring a surprise when the tournament starts in june			1
forget that @entity6 had to qualify through the playoffs and endured a disastrous tournament in @entity20 in 2010 , @entity1 is adamant @entity21 can succeed this time around			1
" i believe in our chance			0
i think @entity27 is building a new team , " he told @entity0 , referring to the @entity6 coach , who captained that @entity26 - winning team			1
" i know when he starts something he always tries to reach his dream , his goal -- and i know his goal is to win			0
" four years ago , @entity12 football was riddled by infighting , unrest and a national manager with a penchant for astrology			1
the nadir in @entity20 , where @entity6 failed to qualify from the group stage and the squad tore itself apart over a dispute between coach @entity44 and striker @entity45 , left scars which took some time to heal			1
@entity45 's tirade at @entity48 resulted in his expulsion from the squad while his fellow teammates boycotted training to register their disgust			0
captain @entity54 was involved in an altercation with fitness coach @entity56 and the players sulked on the team coach as the watching world gazed on in astonishment			2
@entity54 was dropped for the final group game and subsequently suspended after the tournament along with @entity63 and @entity64 , while @entity45 subsequently retired from international level after receiving an 18 - match ban			0
fast - forward to today and things are looking far more optimistic for @entity27 ' side , albeit after a tricky qualification campaign which included a dramatic second - leg playoff victory over @entity72 in november to seal a place in @entity9			0
trailing 2 - 0 from the first leg , @entity6 emerged with a 3 - 0 win in @entity76 -- and was even more impressive in a 2 - 0 friendly win over @entity78 in @entity76 this month			1
@entity6 is 22/1 to win the @entity4 but will be confident of progressing from a group which includes @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
" @entity9 knows that we can challenge and be an outsider , " @entity1 added			2
" i know many countries are afraid of us and because of what we 've demonstrated in the two games against @entity72 and @entity78			0
" we are a team which can play , score and of course step up to claim victory			0
" while @entity6 has several talented players including @entity95 striker @entity94 , it is not expected to challenge the likes of @entity9 , @entity97 , @entity98 or @entity99			1
it is 16 years since @entity1 was part of the team which won the competition on home soil by defeating @entity9 3 - 0 in the final at the @entity6			1
that side , which included the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , was viewed as representing a new @entity6 -- a microcosm of the kaleidoscope of color which had become interwoven with the country 's society			2
this was a team which brought players together from all different backgrounds , whether it be @entity120 , who was born in @entity121 , @entity1 from @entity122 , or @entity109 -- who hails from @entity123			1
under the guidance of coach @entity127 , that generation of @entity12 players was lauded as an example of how successful multiculturalism could be			2
even now , @entity1 gets emotional when he speaks of the success he enjoyed with that group of players			2
" i was in @entity76 yesterday and still there are still too many emotions going around , " he said thursday at @entity0 's @entity134 bureau , as part of his role in @entity138 's @entity137			0
" for us it was like a big revolution			0
we made @entity6 recognize its own communities , its differences , and the mix of cultures			2
" we won a big fight because it made us as one			0
i think when you win a big trophy or big event like that , you do n't think about sport			0
" we think about social matters , integration , education and happiness when you are celebrating			0
