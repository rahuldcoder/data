" @entity0 on the 17th woohoo ! " " on a jet plane			1
" " last day in @entity0 ... i could so live here ... " judging from social media , not everyone is avoiding @entity0 this spring break			1
and , despite a steady stream of bad press and travel warnings , @entity0 is counting on a good year for tourism			1
image problem notwithstanding , @entity0 has been the top foreign country visited by @entity3 for more than two decades			1
@entity0 welcomed more than 16 million @entity3 in 1990 , according to the @entity15 's @entity14			1
with a few periods of fluctuation in between , that number reached 20 million in 2010 , the latest year for which data is available from the @entity3 @entity15			0
" when you hear about swine flu and the drug war and see grisly photos and stories that go along with them , people look at the country on a whole through that light , " said @entity21 writer @entity20 , who has been to @entity0 15 times in his 43 years			2
" that 's not always an accurate representation of the entire country			0
" the @entity35 estimates that 52 million domestic and international tourists will visit the southeastern part of the country in 2012 , thanks to growing numbers of visitors from emerging markets and aggressive public relations campaigns to counter the perception that @entity0 is unsafe			1
the southeast consists of resort areas such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , as well as @entity51 cultural destinations , a key area of focus for the tourist board in 2012			2
analysts say efforts to direct tourists to the southeast reflect the experience of most visitors to the country who stay away from areas in northern mexico plagued by cartel - related violence			2
" while there are security concerns in certain areas in the country , particularly in the north , travel to traditional tourist destinations along the @entity76 remain safe , " said @entity67 of the @entity68 in @entity69			2
the @entity77 issued a travel warning to @entity3 to avoid all but essential travel to all or parts of 14 of 31 @entity0 states			1
no advisory is in effect for @entity84 , @entity85 or @entity86 , states that make up the @entity84 , or for that matter , @entity89 , the nation 's capital			0
" the fact that tourist destinations along the @entity76 still remain safe is further underscored by the @entity77 's most recent travel warnings , which shows that not all of @entity0 is experiencing increased violence as a result of efforts to confront organized crime , " @entity67 said			1
that success might not be evident in the news that comes out of @entity0 , but the numbers tell a different story : a record - breaking 22.67 million international visitors arrived in 2011 , representing a 2 % increase from 2010 , according to figures provided by the @entity35			1
that 's not to say that bad things do n't happen outside the hot zones			0
in february , 22 @entity111 passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports during a shore excursion in the @entity0 seaside resort of @entity116 in the state of @entity118			2
the @entity77 warning advises travelers to defer nonessential travel to areas of @entity118 that border the states of @entity124 and @entity125			1
it also recommends exercising caution when traveling at night outside of cities elsewhere in the state			0
the tour was driving on a remote highway about 15 kilometers ( about 9.3 miles ) outside @entity116 when an individual held them up , @entity134 , chief operating officer of the @entity35 , told @entity135			0
" i can assure this is an isolated , rare incident that should n't have happened , " he said			0
" but at same time , i have to tell you that this is something that could happen anywhere else in the world			0
" putting things in context is a large part of @entity134 's modus operandi			0
while many rushed to interpret the @entity77 's recent expanded travel warning as a blow to @entity0 , @entity134 said he welcomed the extent to which it pinpointed areas to avoid with specific descriptions and a map and highlighted others where no travel warning was in effect			1
and while the @entity77 's travel warning puts @entity0 in the company of @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , none of those countries is described by the @entity77 as a place where " millions of @entity3 citizens safely visit " for study , tourism and business			1
" we try to put things within the proper context of making sure people understand that if there are problems in certain pockets of the country , that does n't mean the major resort destinations and city center destinations are in danger , " @entity134 said			0
" @entity0 is a very large country , the size of western @entity189 , so it 's unfair to paint @entity0 with such a massively broad stroke , " @entity134 said in a phone call this week from @entity184 , where he was representing @entity0 in @entity185 , the world 's biggest travel trade show			1
it was a sentiment he would repeat later in the week in response to the @entity195 's blanket warning against spring break travel to @entity0 , citing drug cartel violence and criminal activity			1
@entity200 officials highlighted an increase in murders of @entity3 citizens in @entity0 and other violent crime concerns			1
" the @entity0 government has made great strides battling the cartels , and we commend their continued commitment to making @entity0 a safer place to live and visit , " @entity195 director @entity204 said in a statement			1
" however , drug cartel violence and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat , even in some resort areas			0
" this is the third year in a row that @entity200 has issued the warning , prompting allegations from the @entity220 that it was a ploy to encourage domestic tourism , according to @entity0 news outlet @entity223			1
last year 's announcement prompted similar reaction , with several leading @entity3 tourism groups urging @entity200 to downgrade the warning to an advisory			1
" we want to caution consumers against overgeneralizing -- taking isolated events and applying them to the whole country , " said @entity229 , president of tour operator trade group , @entity230			0
" @entity0 is a beautiful destination with incredible adventure and cultural experiences available			2
we advise @entity3 to travel with professional tour operators , because they know what 's happening in specific areas of the country and can provide safe and secure travel arrangements			2
" @entity3 travel to @entity0 has fluctuated over the past few years , coinciding with an overall decline in international travel during the recession , according to @entity3 @entity15 numbers			1
figures from the @entity35 indicate that the number of @entity3 visitors dropped by 3 % overall in 2011			0
but they consider it a promising sign the number of @entity3 visitors in the last four months of 2011 was up 10.6 % compared with 2010			0
the fluctuations prompted @entity0 to woo new visitors from outside the @entity3 by building relationships in emerging markets and easing the visa application process with online portals , @entity134 said			2
those efforts paid off in record - breaking numbers for 2011 , with the biggest growth from emerging markets such as @entity266 ( 66 % ) , @entity267 ( 55 % ) and @entity268 ( 30 % )			0
those gains tend to be overshadowed by media coverage of cartel - related violence and occasional acts of violence toward tourists			0
@entity134 acknowledges that parts of @entity0 should be avoided , which is why the tourism board has focused efforts on driving visitors to southern @entity0 with an emphasis on the " @entity281 , " or the @entity51 world , and gastronomy tours			1
the timing could n't be better with doomsday travel ramping up ahead of the alleged @entity51 prophecy of the apocalypse			0
but @entity134 says the push is about diversifying @entity0 's appeal			2
@entity0 's indigenous roots and @entity292 - honored cuisine have always been a big part of its culture , he said			2
again , it seems to be a matter of changing perceptions			0
" we see a great opportunity to share a part of our culture that many visitors do n't normally see , " he said			0
" for those who 've been to @entity0 before , it 's a chance to see the country in a new light			0

@entity0 says it expects 52 million domestic and foreign tourists to visit southeast region in 2012
citing @entity77 advisories , experts say southern @entity0 resorts are safe
international tourism council says @entity200 travel warning is ploy to drive domestic tourism
