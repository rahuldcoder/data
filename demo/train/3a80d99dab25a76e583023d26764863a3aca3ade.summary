-- they 've long been considered topics that are n't polite to discuss at the dinner table			0
as it turns out , politics and religion can get touchy on @entity8 as well			1
the two topics dominated a list of the most controversial pages on the crowdsourced web encyclopedia			1
topping the @entity14 version of the list ? former president @entity16			1
to determine the most controversial pages , researchers from @entity18 looked at their number of " reverts " -- instances in which an editor changes something on a page , only to have someone else come along and change it back to the previous wording			1
alongside @entity16 , the political philosophy of anarchism made the list			1
so did global warming and the @entity34 -- two topics that , while not exclusively political , certainly have political elements			0
as for religion , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 were all among the top 10			1
circumcision and " race and intelligence , " both with obvious controversy attached , made the list , alongside a possibly more surprising page : a list of professional wrestlers on the roster of @entity51			1
the authors of the study , which will be part of an upcoming book , said that on a site as expansive and ambitious as @entity8 , disagreements are bound to happen			2
" while the common aim in the collaboration is clear , unavoidably differences in opinions and views occur , leading to controversies , " they wrote			0
" clearly , there is a positive role of the conflicts : if they can be resolved in a consensus , the resulting product will better reflect the @entity70 than without fighting them out			0
" however , there are examples , where no hope for a consensus seems in sight -- then the struggle strongly limits efficiency			0
" the guiding principle behind @entity8 , which launched in 2001 , is cooperation			2
the thinking is that with a team of volunteer editors spanning the globe , rough edges will eventually be smoothed out and good information will triumph over falsehoods and misinterpretations			0
with more than 470 million unique visitors monthly , @entity8 is one of the most - visited sites on the @entity93			1
it 's written and edited collaboratively by @entity95 volunteers , most of them anonymous			0
according to its own pages , the site has more than 77,000 active contributors working on more than 22 million articles in 285 languages			2
by default , any change that an editor makes on the site is published immediately , subject to cleaning up by editors who come afterward			0
but disagreements , even among well - meaning editors , are bound to happen and , over the years , @entity8 has adopted rules to deal with them			1
on the english - language version , only registered users may create new articles			1
and certain controversial pages get " protection " -- either full protection , which means they can only be edited by administrators , or semi-protection , under which they can only be edited by logged - in users whose accounts have been verified			2
when pages become home to " edit wars , " as the entries for @entity16 and @entity126 rival @entity125 did during the 2004 election , they may be given temporary protection by administrators			2
on the @entity14 - language version of the site , sweeping issues such as religion dominated the most - disputed list			1
but the study 's authors noted that with most other languages , more local or regional topics prevailed			0
" the @entity139 , in particular , occupies a unique role , " they wrote			0
" the language 's status as a ' lingua franca ' ( a widely used working language ) means that @entity139 ends up being edited by a broad community beyond simply ( those ) that have the language as a mother tongue			0
" in @entity151 , the page on @entity150 was the most controversial , with @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity155 philosopher @entity154 making the top 10			1
socialist politician @entity157 topped the @entity159 list ( followed , curiously , by @entity160 ) and " @entity164 crime " topped the @entity162 list			0
in an interesting look at cultural interests , five of the 10 most disputed pages in @entity167 were those of soccer teams -- @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 .			2
