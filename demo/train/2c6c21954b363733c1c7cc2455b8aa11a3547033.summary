-- he 's known as the " @entity2 " and the " @entity3 , " -- an alleged international arms dealer straight out of a cloak - and - dagger spy novel who eluded authorities for years and inspired @entity9 villains			2
but in reality , according to those who have seen or met @entity11 , he is a somber man , sometimes nattily dressed , a wheeler - dealer who has insisted he is innocent of the allegations leveled against him			1
@entity11 , a @entity17 citizen and former military officer , speaks six languages " and i could see him bargaining in all six at the same time , " wrote @entity0 's @entity22 in 2008 , recalling her meeting with @entity11 in 2002 in @entity24 , @entity17			1
@entity11 arrived in @entity25 late tuesday after being extradited from @entity26			1
he faces charges in the @entity28 of conspiring to kill @entity28 nationals , conspiring to kill @entity28 officers or employees , conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile and conspiring to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization			0
@entity28 law enforcement officers have spent years pursuing him , and the extradition process from @entity26 was an arduous one for them			0
@entity11 is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world , from @entity41 to @entity42			1
before his 2008 arrest , @entity45 agents led a sting operation by posing as members of the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , officials said			0
" his early days are a mystery , " said @entity50 , a senior fellow at the @entity51 who co-authored a book on @entity11			1
@entity55 told @entity57 magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports , @entity11 was born in 1967 in @entity59 , @entity60 , the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic			1
a pro-bout website -- @entity55 said @entity11 put it up himself -- says he was born into an " average home and an average family " and that his parents were employees in the " administrative and accounting fields			1
" but , @entity55 said , some reports are that @entity11 's parents were involved in intelligence			1
" his mother was supposedly very high in the @entity76 , " @entity55 said , adding that @entity11 has consistently denied that			1
" he graduated from the @entity77 on @entity78 , a well - known feeder school for @entity17 military intelligence , and is known to have a true gift for languages , " @entity55 told @entity57			0
@entity11 has said that he worked as a military officer in @entity84			1
others have said it was actually @entity87 -- which would make sense , as @entity17 had a large military presence there at the time , @entity55 told @entity0			0
he said @entity11 's rise stemmed from the end of @entity94 and the rise of capitalism in the early 1990s in the former @entity98 bloc			1
" he was a @entity98 officer , most likely a lieutenant , who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the @entity98 and the state sponsorship that entailed : abandoned aircraft on the runways from @entity24 to @entity107 , no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance ; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary ; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional @entity98 clients and newly emerging armed groups from @entity120 to the @entity121 , " @entity55 told the magazine			0
" he simply wedded the three things , taking aircraft for almost nothing , filling them with cheaply purchased weapons from the arsenals , and flying them to clients who could pay			0
" " he knew the @entity120 market , " @entity55 said wednesday			0
" he was clearly aware of who [ @entity17 's ] past clients had been ... i think he had foresight , and i think he understood the world changes much more than the average @entity98 bloc person			2
" he first became known when the @entity135 began investigating him in the early - to - mid 1990s and the @entity28 began to get involved , @entity55 told @entity0			2
@entity11 's website , which spells his name @entity138 , says he became notorious because of a smear campaign , " fictitious tales and stories which were generated from one source -- a corrupt @entity135 contractor who was generously paid for the @entity135 contracts he arranged with the help of others for @entity138 's companies , and then became mad for vengeance when @entity138 refused to continue paying him			1
" the site said the @entity28 case against him is based on " lies " and paid informants			0
attempts by @entity0 to contact @entity11 's wife were unsuccessful wednesday			1
ironically , the @entity28 is also among @entity11 's clients , even indirectly , @entity55 said wednesday			1
@entity11 companies were used to fly for government contractors in @entity161			1
most of those flights -- estimated in the hundreds -- occurred after then - president @entity165 had signed an executive order making it illegal to do business with @entity11 because he represented a security threat to the @entity28 , @entity55 told @entity57			1
" the @entity173 , under a congressional inquiry initiated by sen. @entity172 , found it had used @entity11 companies , acknowledged it , and stopped , " @entity55 told the magazine			1
" ... despite the public revelation , the congressional inquiry , the executive order and a subsequent @entity178 order freezing the assets of @entity11 and his closest associates , the flights continued for many months , at least until the end of 2005			1
" the @entity28 did not have the airlift capacity to go in at the time , @entity55 said wednesday			0
but @entity11 had planes close by , in the @entity186 , and " he was willing to fly without insurance			1
he paid pilots a flat rate			0
" at one point , the @entity173 and @entity178 departments were going after @entity11 while the @entity193 continued to pay him			1
" it was one of those contradictory situations , " @entity55 said			0
@entity55 told @entity0 he believes the trial against @entity11 will be quick , as he does n't believe anyone wants @entity11 to tell what he knows -- because he knows a lot			1
his knowledge could potentially embarrass not only @entity17 , but the @entity135 , the @entity28 and @entity201 , among others , he said			0
" i do n't think they 're going to have a wide - ranging free - for - all			2
" and so far , " he 's apparently been a stand - up guy to the @entity17 , " and has n't threatened to turn on them , @entity55 said			1
for one thing , they have his family , which is " considerable leverage " -- @entity11 is widely known to be a family man , @entity55 wrote in august in @entity210			1
" he endured more than two years in a @entity26 prison , losing more than 70 pounds and never showing any signs of doubting he would ultimately walk away , " @entity55 wrote in the article			0
" he has been , so far , a soldier 's soldier			1
" that 's largely in line with how @entity11 views himself , @entity55 said wednesday -- as a soldier and a businessman			1
" i think everyone agrees on a personal level , he 's very charming			2
he 's very articulate , very sort of well - mannered and obviously a very smart guy , " he said , adding @entity11 has never considered himself as a " trigger - puller or bad guy			1
" " i do n't think he views himself as having any blood on his hands , " he said			2
in addition , @entity11 approached the @entity228 and the @entity229 through an intermediary just after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on @entity25 and @entity232 , offering to help oust the @entity233 if paid tens of millions , @entity55 told @entity57			1
" negotiations were serious and lasted several months , but we do not know what , if any , parts of the deal he offered were accepted			0
" but in 2002 , when he met with @entity22 , @entity11 was interested in setting the record straight			2
he traveled with a bodyguard and a female aide , @entity22 said , and was " dressed in a well - cut dark jacket with gold buttons , grey trousers , white shirt and basket - weave - patterned silk tie			0
" he also sported a wool topcoat			0
" his @entity249 was quite good , " @entity22 recalled			0
" he seemed intelligent , canny ; serious but nervous			0
" she said he was " tall , heavy - set , a bit rough around the edges , but he acted like a man who has been wronged			0
" she asked him about allegations against him -- did he sell arms to the @entity233 ? to @entity257 ? did he supply rebels in @entity120 and get paid in blood diamonds ? -- and he denied each one			0
" it 's a false allegation and it 's a lie , " he said			2
" i 've never touched diamonds in my life and i 'm not a diamond guy and i do n't want that business			2
" " i 'm not afraid , " he told @entity22			0
" i did n't do anything in my life i should be afraid of			2
and all this looks to me like a witch hunt			0
look , i 'm coming to your office , i have no problem			0
and i said , ' hey , who 's looking for me ? ' i 'm here			2
i 'm not hiding from nobody			0
and i do n't want this story going on			2
" @entity22 asked him if he had ever met @entity275 , and he said no , adding that if he had , he might have helped prevent the 9/11 attacks			0
@entity55 believes @entity11 's downfall was insisting on closing the supposed " deal " with @entity49 himself			1
" he was more than happy to say he knew the weapons would be used to kill @entity28 , " he said wednesday			0
meanwhile , @entity11 himself -- who reportedly has used names including " @entity11 , " " @entity11 , " " @entity11 , " " @entity11 " and " @entity11 " -- is thought to have been the inspiration for the arms - dealer character played by @entity285 in the 2005 movie " @entity3			2
" " someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case some day , and i can tell you that it will read like the very best work of @entity295 , only in this case it wo n't be fiction , " @entity287 , then assistant administrator and chief of operations for the @entity45 , told @entity0 in 2008			0
much of what @entity11 is alleged to have done is morally reprehensible , but not illegal , @entity55 said , noting there are no penalties for violating @entity135 weapons sanctions			2
" our book ends saying , ' they 'll never catch him , ' " he said .			0
