@entity0 -- survivors of the @entity4 cruise ship accident off the coast of @entity6 recounted in riveting testimony before @entity8 on wednesday that they feared for their lives after the ship hit a reef last month			1
" we were at our dinner table on @entity16 and were in the process of ordering our food , and we had just ordered our appetizers , " said @entity12 , who was celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary with her husband on the ship			1
" at that moment , there was a violent shaking of the ship , followed by loud crash noises as the plates and glasses broke due to the listing of the ship towards the starboard side			1
lights went out immediately , but there was no announcement as to what had happened			0
it was pitch dark with no visibility			0
everyone nearby started to scream , and a few minutes into the ordeal the emergency lights came on , and we observed that the ship is now listing on the port side			1
this is when the first announcement came on telling us it was nothing but an electrical failure , and that everything is under control			0
" there were 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew members aboard the @entity4 when it set sail january 13			1
@entity12 told a @entity51 and @entity53 hearing that " crew members urged the passengers to remain calm and seated			1
the staff started to bring out people 's food , as if nothing bad had happened			1
" she said a half hour after the accident , she and her husband decided to leave the dining room and go back to their room to get their life jackets , climbing six levels while holding onto the guard rails in dim emergency lighting			1
" as we were getting to our room there were constant announcements of the same message , ' ladies and gentleman , everything is under control at this point , and it seems to be a generator failure			0
please stay calm and wait for further instructions and be cooperative			0
' what caught our attention was that all the announcements were made on behalf of the captain , and never once did we hear the captain speak , " @entity12 said			1
" no one seemed to have any clear idea as to why they had to , what they had to do in this situation , or where they were supposed to send us , " she added			0
her husband , @entity95 , told committee members " there was not one instance where crew members or anybody had mentioned that there was anything wrong other than the electrical issue			2
so we felt very betrayed , very much lied to at that point			0
" despite being urged to stay in their rooms , the @entity105 headed to a lifeboat			0
" people started to panic and getting frustrated as the ship is tilting more by the minute			1
we were getting frustrated , aggravated , and the crowd was pushing and shoving against each other , " @entity12 said			0
" everybody was on their good vacation , but here we were sitting on a life boat , on a life boat , staring into the eyes of death , " she told @entity1 in an interview before the hearing began			0
the number of confirmed dead in the accident is 25 , with several people still missing			1
rep. @entity126 , @entity127 , told the @entity105 , " i 'm embarrassed with what happened			0
" @entity130 officials said an investigation is under way to determine what lessons can be learned from the incident and what regulations should be strengthened to protect passengers			2
one part of the probe includes whether watertight doors were closed after the ship struck the reef			2
the investigation will also look at crew training procedures , language and ship inspections			2
" from that , we hope to develop a picture of what happened on board and the human factors in the unfolding of that tragedy , " said vice admiral @entity146 , commandant for operations with the @entity130			0
@entity155 pointed out that the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the @entity158 was drawing near , on april 14 , and the " @entity4 reminds us that our new technology can not be taken for granted			1
we 're only as good as the human systems that operate them			0
" one immediate change is the cruise industry 's decision to conduct muster drill exercises prior to a ship 's departure from port , something @entity155 called a " positive development			1
" there are some 170 passenger ships that operate from @entity174 ports each year			0
the @entity53 said in 2010 more than 10 million @entity174 residents took a cruise , generating more than $ 37 billion for the @entity174 economy and creating 330,000 @entity174 jobs			2
representatives of the cruise line industry told lawmakers it is reviewing procedures in the wake of the accident			1
" the cruise industry remains one of the safest recreational travel options , " said @entity186 , president and ceo of @entity188			2
she said the industry is " proactive and transparent " when it comes to safety			0
the captain of the @entity4 reportedly abandoned the ship well before most of the passengers evacuated and refused to return when ordered to do so by the @entity198 @entity51			1
he faces several criminal charges in connection with the accident			1
rep. @entity202 , @entity203 , who holds a captain 's license , said pointedly , " nothing 's wrong with the ship			1
it 's a captain who forgot he was a captain			2
" @entity202 cautioned against " casting aspersions " on the @entity174 cruise line industry and its " good safety record			2
" " we want to avoid collateral damage to the cruise industry , " added rep. @entity212 , @entity213			0
" this is truly a teachable moment			0
" but when @entity212 asked @entity12 whether she would ever take a cruise again , she said , " not in the near future			0
