-- @entity3 @entity2 justice @entity1 downplayed reports of personal and ideological rifts stemming from the recent landmark health care reform ruling , telling @entity0 in an exclusive interview " it offends me " to hear criticism of his colleagues over how they ruled			1
the 76 - year - old justice talked wednesday with @entity0 's " @entity12 , " discussing a range of judicial topics -- from the death penalty to abortion rights and the @entity18 decision			1
@entity1 , along with @entity19 , is co-author of a new book , " @entity21 : the @entity22			1
" the men describe their legal philosophy , and how to make sense of the law and the @entity3 @entity27			0
they call their approach " textualism			0
" even in dissent , @entity1 stirs controversy @entity1 would not specifically address the health care decision or other recent or current case issues , such as immigration enforcement , affirmative action or gay marriage			1
and he would not discuss how the court reached its health care ruling in internal deliberations			0
but the conservative justice downplayed media reports of personal fallout from opposing conservative and liberal members of the court over the 5 - 4 decision three weeks ago			1
@entity1 was on the losing side of the ruling upholding the @entity47 , the sweeping legislation championed by president @entity48			1
chief justice @entity49 was the deciding vote in that decision , agreeing with his liberal colleagues to uphold the individual mandate , which would financially punish people who do not purchase health insurance			1
some media and blog reports -- citing sources with specific knowledge of the deliberation process -- suggested strong tensions among the court 's conservatives over @entity49 ' vote , which some commentators perceived as political expediency			1
but @entity1 said it was wrong to question @entity49 or other court members personally for their legal conclusions			1
" we are not a political institution , " @entity1 said			1
" i do n't think any of my colleagues on any cases vote the way they do for political reasons			2
" @entity1 added he was dismayed at the criticism of @entity49 , suggesting those who may have leaked information were not entirely privy to the internal discussions over the health care decision			1
on abortion , @entity1 said the 1973 @entity83 decision legalizing the medical procedure should be overturned , believing it remains an issue best left for states to decide			1
no matter what it does , high court is seen as political the court does n't do democracy any favors by getting involved in the abortion debate in such a way , according to @entity1			1
likewise with capital punishment , @entity1 said the issue is not whether the court should ultimately decide whether there should still be a death penalty -- he claimed not to have an opinion on that -- but rather whether individual states should decide such a question			1
" if you do n't like the death penalty , fine , change the law , " he said			1
" i 'm not ' pro ' death penalty , i 'm ' anti ' the idea that is not ultimately a democratic choice			1
" but he emphasized capital punishment has been around since the nation 's founding and was well - established in law and social tradition			2
and @entity1 reiterated his firm views over what he agreed was the most talked - about recent court decision -- the 2000 ruling effectively handing the presidency to @entity120 after the @entity122 ballot recounts			1
" get over it , " he said about supporters of @entity124 , many of whom are still convinced the case was wrongly decided in favor of the @entity129			0
" he ( @entity124 ) would have lost anyway if all the ballots were recounted			0
" in his new book , @entity1 argues interpreting laws and the @entity27 properly requires a strict approach to look at the actual text of the law itself			2
he warns that squishy , unprincipled decision - making is bad for the country and for the reputation of judges themselves			0
" the descent into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely traceable to nontextual means of interpretation , which erodes society 's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no agreed - upon meaning , " write @entity1 and @entity19			1
the jaunty jurist has long been able to light up , or ignite , a room with his often brash demeanor and wicked sense of humor , and he displayed that in the hourlong conversation with @entity157			1
despite his reputation as an intellectual fighter , @entity1 described himself as " a peaceful man			2
" when asked if he had ever broken the law , the justice said , " i 've had a few speeding tickets , though none recently			2
" his outgoing personality and sharply written opinions have made him among the most recognizable of justices , and a particular favorite of conservative activists , scholars and lawmakers			2
president @entity172 named @entity1 to the high court in 1986 after previous jobs as an appeals court judge , a government and private lawyer , and a law professor			2
justices finances show overseas travel , book royalties , gifts " at one extreme , he can alienate some of his colleagues , " said @entity184 , legal affairs editor at @entity185 , who has written a biography of @entity1			2
" if he is trying to get anybody to sign an opinion , it was harder when he would use more combative language			0
but as much as they would say ' i 'd like to strangle @entity196 , ' he was still theirs in many ways			0
" that harshness was evident in the closing days of the term ending in june			0
on two issues that left @entity1 on the losing side -- health care and immigration enforcement -- he displayed the fierce rhetoric that has become his trademark			2
@entity1 , writing for the minority , argued the court 's ruling favoring federal authority over immigration matters encroaches on @entity212 's sovereign powers			1
" if securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of @entity212 , we should cease referring to it as a @entity219			0
" " he can be belligerent ; he is obviously very candid about how he feels , " @entity184 said			0
" he loves to call it as he sees it , completely not politically correct			0
in fact , he prides himself on not being @entity223 on the bench , in court			0
" many legal scholars say @entity1 ultimately failed to sway his colleagues on the really big constitutional issues , and court sources say he has grown somewhat frustrated over the years being on the losing side of many cases , or not being able to write more majority opinions			1
@entity1 was born in 1936 and admitted to being the center of attention as the only child , doted on by his father , a @entity238 - born professor of romance languages , and his mother , a schoolteacher			2
they instilled a love of learning and the confidence to exercise his intellectual muscles			0
he attended @entity247 as an undergrad , and later @entity249 , where he met his future wife , @entity250 , who was attending nearby @entity251			0
they raised nine children , including a colonel in the @entity255 , and a priest			0
the family is united by a strong catholic faith			0
when asked about his greatest achievement as a judge , @entity1 went back to the foundation of his book			2
he said he hoped he has moved his colleagues toward a more textured view of the law			0
" the court pays more attention now to the text " of the law and the @entity27 , he said , and less to legislative history , congressional floor debates and the views of foreign governments			0
for a lover of language , the precise meaning of words contained in the law has been his goal			0
and he has no plans to step down anytime soon			0
" of course , i 'll retire when i start to realize i 'm not doing as good a job as i should , " he said , adding he still thinks he is fully engaged			0
