@entity2 - @entity1 border -- the dead are everywhere			1
nonexistent until last june , the encampment of about 1,600 people now is a haven of peace compared with the terror experienced in the country just 300 yards away			2
housed in neat , white tents in southern @entity1 , with cooking stations in between , people here do not have to worry about being silenced , tortured , arrested or killed			1
in other words , they do n't live in fear of what they say happened all around them on a daily basis -- and still happens -- in their war - torn nation of @entity2			1
@entity23 slaps new santions on @entity2 they are , however , left with the memories of people killed			1
and they share them freely , in the form of grainy videos showing their loved ones ' funerals , pictures on cell phones of their missing sons and stories about the horrors they escaped but many of their countrymen still endure			2
" they want the world to understand them			0
they want the world to bear witness , " @entity44 , a senior fellow at @entity46 's @entity45 , said monday from the camp			2
" they also see the camera as a way of holding onto the memory of this lost world , a world that is very achingly close			0
" the fighting has prompted thousands to flee @entity2 , setting up new lives in a number of makeshift camps in neighboring nations			1
the @entity63 estimates at least 9,000 people have been killed over the past 14 months in @entity2			1
president @entity66 's government blames the violence on " armed terrorist gangs , " while the opposition and many in the international community say it is the result of the regime 's bloody crackdown on dissent			2
not including arrests , opposition groups actually estimate the death toll is at more than 11,000 and growing			0
a month after ' cease - fire , ' where does @entity2 stand ? two of those killed are sons of @entity83 , who recalled from the camp in @entity1 how they had been fatally shot by security forces while demonstrating in @entity2 about a year ago			1
another son is missing , believed to be arrested and possibly killed without ever having never met his 7 - month - old son			2
@entity83 can not justify why @entity2 security forces killed his sons and the children of so many others			1
but he knows why they spoke up , and why many are still fighting			0
" we had young men that cried out and shouted , ' freedom ! ' , and they were killed for that ? " he asked rhetorically			2
" we just want freedom			0
what 's wrong with asking for freedom ? " through a hole in a fence , past olive groves and across rolling farmland , that sense of freedom lives -- albeit tenuously			1
while the @entity2 government exerts control over most of the country , there are exceptions			1
the police station of one town , for instance , was turned into makeshift barracks for fighters from the rebel @entity115			2
at a school , where @entity66 's government still pays the teachers ' salaries and for textbooks , students in blue uniforms burst into chants slamming their president			0
outside town , opposition fighters take up positions along roads			0
they take a 19 - year - old prisoner who , they say , was headed to enlist in @entity66 's armed forces , sparing him only after he vows to join their fighting force instead			0
even with this sense of ownership and fragile freedom , there is little sense here that the end is near			0
that 's especially true back at the refugee camp in @entity1 , where expectations are low that they will return home safely anytime soon			1
the cease - fire that was to take effect last month has n't ended the violence			0
one @entity2 activist , identified as @entity149 , says the government is " playing games " even with the scores of unarmed @entity63 monitors in the country			1
@entity149 said the government decreases attacks wherever the monitors are , then fills the void after they leave by pounding communities with mortars and gunfire			0
@entity149 says he has all but given up hope that people from outside @entity2 will intervene and stop his people 's suffering			1
but he still has faith that the dreams of he and other opposition will be realized			0
we know now that world is happy watching us being killed , and we will do it on our own , " he said			0
" even if it takes 10 years , we are on the streets and we will not change , we will not retreat , and we will not give up			0

*hundreds* of @entity2 pack a camp in @entity1 , one of several set up for refugees
they came here to flee violence that @entity63 says has killed at least 9,000 people
rebel fighters control some areas in @entity2
a man whose two sons were killed asks : " what 's wrong with asking for freedom ? "
