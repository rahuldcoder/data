@entity0 -- shortly after @entity4 was tapped to carry out president @entity6 's signature health care reform effort , the head of @entity3 found herself in the crosshairs of @entity8 determined to repeal the law			1
the two - term @entity11 governor - turned - @entity13 - chief - defender is resigning as health secretary			1
she 's leaving after a problem - plagued rollout of @entity16 , the federal website portal critical to the law 's implementation , but with the administration taking a victory lap after unexpectedly reaching and then exceeding its sign - up target of 7 million			2
@entity13 hits 7.5 million sign - ups , @entity4 says a tweet by @entity25 , former senior adviser to @entity6 , perhaps best sums up the tension @entity4 faced as she tried to navigate implementing the controversial law familiar as @entity13			1
" when all is said and done , @entity4 has lots to be proud of including the surprisingly strong finish on exchange signups after a rocky start , " @entity25 wrote			1
that sentiment is " a little passive aggressive , " said @entity34 , a @entity1 political commentator			0
" they want the message to be : blame @entity4 with the problems with @entity13 especially as they go into a midterm election where this is going to be a big issue			1
i think that 's a little unfair to her			0
" it was n't always this way			0
she once was seen as a @entity49 rising star when she was tapped to deliver the @entity49 response to president @entity51 's final @entity53 address			0
she was the @entity54 girl whose political blood ran blue but flourished in a red state			0
her father was a former @entity49 governor of @entity58			0
she was a fan of @entity59 and college sports , running and the @entity61			0
she ran for the governor 's office with promises to improve government efficiency and create a more business - friendly climate within the state			1
she navigated a judicial order to boost school spending during a time when her state was facing one of its worst budget crises since the @entity74			0
she was also able to help lead the state to an economic recovery and lower unemployment , according to the state 's website at the time			2
in 2008 , @entity79 called her " one to watch " and @entity80 dubbed her one of four " rising stars from the heartland , " and put on the short list as one of the country 's five best governors			2
@entity49 blogger @entity88 in 2006 predicted on his @entity90 web site that @entity4 would be on the shortlist for vice president on the party 's ticket			1
he also gave her kudos for wooing frustrated @entity11 republicans			2
she was n't @entity6 's first choice to head @entity3 -- sen. @entity98 of @entity99 was forced to withdraw over a controversy with his tax records and questions about work some considered lobbying			1
it was hoped that her background as someone who worked across the aisle could help @entity6 as he set about the herculean task of health care reform			2
despite an initial controversy over what she called " unintentional errors " in tax returns and pushback from both pro-life and pro-choice advocates , she sailed through @entity119 confirmation on a 65 - 31 vote			2
@entity8 senator : sebelius the ' laughingstock of @entity123 ' as the @entity13 neared implementation , she faced increasing scrutiny from @entity8 members of @entity128 who wanted to forestall @entity13 's momentum			1
that pressure and criticism only increased after the mandate became law in 2010 without @entity8 support			2
she , her agency and the administration faced blistering criticism about the law 's legality -- challenges that were decided by the @entity141			0
she was routinely grilled at congressional hearings about whether the law could be implemented on time , was financially sustainable and if the administration would hit enrollment targets			0
and she was hammered in hearings over the web portal 's disastrous roll out in october			2
@entity3 chief : president did n't know of @entity13 website woes beforehand there were calls for her resignation from a number of @entity157 republicans and several senators amid the @entity16 debacle			2
@entity13 enrollment eventually exceeded its target of 7 million -- but not without a last - minute surge in the days before the deadline in march			1
and senior administration officials say @entity4 told the president last month that it would reach its goal and that would be a good time for her to go			1
the @entity6 official said @entity4 ' decision to leave had little to do with the initial uproar over the website			1
a @entity157 official praised her overseeing " one of the most consequential initiatives of this administration " as well as her efforts to " improve children 's health , expand mental health care , reduce racial and ethnic disparities , bring us closer to the first @entity182 - free generation and promote women 's health			0
" republicans paid her backhanded compliments			0
" she had an impossible task : nobody can make @entity13 work , " @entity157 majority leader @entity186 tweeted			1
@entity6 acknowledged the botched rollout of the enrollment website under @entity4 ' watch			1
" she 's got bumps			0
i 've got bumps , bruises , " he said on friday			0
but " the final score speaks for itself			0
" but some see the administration 's handling of @entity4 ' departure as damning with faint praise			1
" i mean , this is one of those classic @entity0 dances where the administration praises the person but the at the same time you want the message to sort of suddenly be that we were n't so happy with what she did and this -- and we could n't of course get rid of her when the website was a disaster , right , " @entity34 said			0
members of her party back in her home state told the @entity217 they were stunned by @entity4 ' move but could well understand her motivation			1
" i think she has had the toughest job in @entity0 over the past four years , " @entity220 , a former congressman and @entity119 candidate , told the paper			0
" she has done a good job under the worst possible circumstances you can imagine			0
" @entity4 told the @entity217 in an interview on thursday that she always knew she would not " be here to turn out the lights in 2017			1
" during friday 's event , where @entity6 also nominated her successor , @entity4 stood next to the president			1
and she described her time as health secretary as " the most meaningful work i 've ever been a part of			1
" she leaves the job in may			0
