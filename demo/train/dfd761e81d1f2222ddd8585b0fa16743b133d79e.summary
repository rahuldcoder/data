-- for a second straight day , president @entity1 touted proposals from his @entity3 at a campaign - style event outside of @entity5 , this time visiting a @entity7 preschool where youngsters on a winter break showed up to mimic a regular day			1
@entity1 's visit to the @entity14 , in the city of @entity11 just outside @entity12 , followed his call in tuesday night 's speech to @entity17 for investments in high - quality early childhood education programs			1
the president spent time in a classroom where he hugged some students -- who told him they saw him on television -- and praised the teachers he said were giving their students a boost into the educational system			1
" this is n't baby - sitting , " he said			0
children who take prekindergarten classes are more likely to read at their grade level , graduate from high school and hold a job down the road -- but fewer than 30 % of 4 - year - olds are enrolled in prekindergarten programs like those at @entity14 , he said			0
" @entity40 is found in what works			2
we know it works , " he said			2
" if you are looking for a good bang for your educational buck , this is it right here			0
that 's why , even in times of tight budgets , states like @entity7 and @entity55 have worked to make a preschool slot available for nearly every parent who is looking for one for their child			2
" in the classroom , @entity1 sat in a small chair and helped children with tablet blocks at one table			1
he then moved to another to engage in a brief game of @entity66 , peering at little faces through a magnifying glass			0
and he took a moment to warn the parents of the young children that " they grow up to be , like , 5 ' 10 " -- and even if they 're still nice to you , they basically do n't have a lot of time for you during the weekends			0
" " they have sleepovers and dates , " he said to laughter			0
" so all that early investment just leads them to go away			2
" friday , he will head to @entity83 to continue his campaign for the main proposals of the @entity3 address , which emphasized themes of his re-election campaign last year , including equal opportunity and middle - class growth			1
on wednesday , @entity1 toured an auto parts plant in @entity94 , @entity95 , and urged @entity17 to support the jobs agenda in his address the night before			1
in @entity83 , he 'll speak about the economy and the city 's rampant gun violence			0
@entity1 and congressional democrats are locked in a fierce political debate with @entity103 over government spending and federal deficits , with a showdown pending on mandatory spending cuts set to take effect march 1			1
in his @entity3 address and again thursday , @entity1 said making an early commitment to education saves money later for local governments and boosts graduation rates			1
he also spotlighted studies showing children who attend preschool have lower teen pregnancy rates and are less prone to engage in violent crime			2
the thursday stop required some scheduling changes at the school , which had yet to fully return from a winter holiday			0
parents with children enrolled there received an e-mail this week with the offer of a " one - day experience " thursday for the president 's visit			0
" this day would resemble a normal school day : same bus routes and times , same school beginning and end times , regular instructional day with the same staff , and breakfast and lunch offerings , " the school 's principal , @entity132 , wrote			0
" president @entity1 's visit promises to be an amazing opportunity for our students to expand their worlds and for @entity11 to celebrate its exemplary teaching and learning			1
" the @entity150 did not immediately respond to an inquiry for an explanation on the timing of the visit			0
@entity1 's emotional plea might lead to vote on guns @entity1 challenges @entity103 to work with him , but @entity158 signals no			1
