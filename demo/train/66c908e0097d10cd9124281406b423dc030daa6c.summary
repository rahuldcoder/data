-- the moment i saw that guinea pig 's corpse , i made up my mind			1
i would not tell my son @entity6 was dead ... at least not that night			1
@entity8 had five tests within the next two days			1
i was n't going to let grief jeopardize his grades			2
checkers , on the left , enjoys a bit of kale with @entity16			2
i realize instantly the challenges of my decision			2
how could i keep this secret in a 10 - by - 12 room in which the guinea pig chalet was almost as big as the twin bed ? i 'd already goofed by yelping , " oh , my ! " when i saw the body			1
@entity8 heard me from his bathroom			2
" what 's wrong , @entity27 ? are you ok ? " " i 'm fine , " i reply			1
but he recognizes that i have n't answered both questions			2
" but what 's wrong ? " " nothing			1
" " well , why did you say that ? is it the guinea pigs ? " i feel panicked			1
no sloshing ! he 's drying off ! pajamas are next ! i realize i 'm holding my breath , and in my head , i 'm yelling , " move , @entity41 ! move ! " i exhale as i lie			1
" in what seemed like one move , i reach in the closet , dump shoes out of a box , grab @entity6 , plunk the stiff in the box , run downstairs , stuff the cardboard casket into a plastic bag , dash to the garage trash can , finish rapid hand - washing and make it upstairs as my third - grader steps into the hall			2
" we 're having storytime in my bed tonight ! " i say breathlessly			2
my bed is off - limits except for nightmares , illness or saturday morning			2
@entity8 's so excited about the treat , he runs for the king - sized sanctum without asking questions			1
we read and pray , and then i give him a piggyback ride into his dark bedroom			2
it 's wednesday , 7:45 p.m. , and for now , i 'm in the clear			1
by the time @entity8 wakes the next morning , i have a plan : darkness and distraction			2
we 're always 30 minutes into our commute before the sun rises			2
between a disabled circuit breaker to prevent lights in his room from working , piggyback rides up and down the stairs , dressing in mom 's room ( where the lights work ) while we review potential bonus words , multiplication drills , @entity89 recitation for the @entity89 test , questions science and reading lessons , there are enough morning distractions to safeguard my secret			1
thursday evening is a challenge			2
in our house , @entity96 is for weekends only			2
it 's cold and drizzly outside ; @entity100 has beaten me in chess -- twice			1
i pull out the biggest distraction of all			0
" i 'm going to let you see a video tonight			0
you need to relax a bit from those tests today , " i say			1
his eyebrows make a big v on his forehead			0
" but it 's a school night , @entity27			1
" i assure him it 's ok			1
he 's suspicious , but tv is as awesome as getting in @entity27 's bed , so no more questions			1
my co-workers split into camps			1
the @entity121 ream me for concealing the death			0
he deserves timely notice of death			0
i care more about grades than his emotional health			0
bad things will happen to @entity8 at inopportune times in his life , and he has to learn to juggle difficulties			0
i 'm delaying his development			0
the @entity133 has opinions , too			0
that guinea pig still will be dead friday			1
@entity100 will be just as sad after his tests with fewer consequences than if he 's sad before the tests			1
make sure you 're honest about why you delayed telling him			0
after school friday , i break the news			1
there 's a shriek and then loads of tears			1
i 'll never forget the long drawn - out wail , " i loved her like a daughter ! " i 'm convinced that boy 's been reading @entity151 , because there is way too much drama that follows			1
we must wear black for three days			0
the only song we can listen to on the " @entity157 " cd is the duet after @entity160 and @entity161 break up			0
it 's the saddest one			1
he cancels @entity164 , because there is nothing happy about this day			0
she was on her side at the end of the ramp			0
her mouth was open with her two big teeth protruding			0
no , it did n't look like she suffered			0
maybe a lung problem killed her			0
i think @entity16 ( the cage mate ) will be fine			0
no , it was n't your care that killed her			0
and then finally , " she died wednesday			1
" wednesday ? ! " " honey , you had a science test			0
you needed to know your binominal nomenclature			0
you had a math unit test , a reading test			0
you had to do your scripture recitation and a @entity89 test			0
you see how upset you are now ? i could n't let you go to school and take tests feeling like this			1
" there 's a long pause			1
and then he says the words that make giving piggyback rides on a spine with bad discs and disabling circuit breakers worth it			0
he stares deeply and says , " thank you , @entity27			1
" maybe the @entity121 are right			0
maybe @entity8 deserved to know sooner			0
i 'm certain he 'll develop into a man who can handle more than one problem at a time			0
and @entity6 , rest in peace .			0
