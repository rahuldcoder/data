-- usually television focuses its attention on winners , but @entity6 @entity5 's fighting spirit and never - say - die attitude prompted a rethink wednesday in one of the world 's toughest sporting events			1
appropriately nicknamed the " @entity12 , " @entity5 had to show all those qualities just to get to the finish of the 11th stage of the @entity16			1
@entity17 falls on previous days had rendered the former outsider for yellow jersey honors a relative passenger -- over 14 minutes adrift of race leader @entity21 of @entity22 after the 10th stage ahead of tuesday 's rest day			1
little good that had done the former @entity26 champion , who was born in @entity27			0
according to his @entity29 team , @entity5 had awoken with a very sore back as a result of his injuries and it was clear from the start of the 187.5 km leg from @entity35 to @entity36 that he was in trouble			2
the terrain for most of the stage was flat and riders of his quality usually have little difficulty in staying with the main bunch , gaining shelter from other riders , but not for @entity5 this day			1
with 82km to go he became distanced and as a winner of the prestigious @entity50 race just ahead of the @entity16 , the television coverage took an interest in his plight			2
so as @entity21 and the other leaders rode comfortably along , @entity5 was seen with his face etched in agony and with tears in his eyes			1
even for one with such dogged determination the hopelessness of his plight was apparent and with 60km to go @entity5 briefly stopped to talk with his team managers			2
the official @entity16 website reported he had quit and nobody could have criticized him , but moments later @entity5 was back in the saddle , grimacing again and slipping even further off the pace			1
the closing kilometers of the stage took the peloton over some testing short climbs and it was a whittled down leading group which rolled into @entity36			0
@entity21 and his @entity72 team did an excellent job of controlling the race so he came under no danger , but @entity77 rider @entity76 , who briefly held the yellow jersey on @entity79 , july 4 , took his opportunity to claim a superb stage win			1
the @entity83 star had time in hand to raise his arms in triumph with the fast - charging @entity87 claiming second			0
@entity21 retained his two minutes 23 second advantage over second - placed @entity89 of @entity90 with @entity91 of @entity92 a further 24 seconds adrift			2
@entity5 might have hoped to be among the leading contenders , now the 25 - year - old was just battling to survive the time cut off for the stage			1
he came in 32 minutes and five seconds after @entity76 crossed the line and just inside the time limit , with riders having to finish within a certain percentage of the winner under @entity16 rules			1
team director @entity103 praised @entity5 's courage			2
" we know he had a very hard day , worse than we expected , " he told the official @entity16 website			0
" it 's very disappointing to come to this race with the kind of of expectations that @entity5 had			0
he deserved much better than this , so that 's cruel			0
it came from these two crashes in two days			0
" for someone with this character it 's only natural to make it to the finish line , " he added			0
@entity5 will hope he can avoid a similar problem over the next few days and get a chance to shine in the @entity122 and @entity123 where his climbing ability could give him the opportunity of a stage win			2
it was to his probable disadvantage that a blazing sun finally shone wednesday after the cool and wet conditions which have marked earlier stages and seen the departure of race favorites such as defending champion @entity134 and two - time winner @entity135 to crashes			0
with those two sidelined it has been a gift to 2013 @entity138 winner @entity21 -- who looks unstoppable after winning the second and 10th stages in fine style			0
but as @entity5 found , it takes just a momentary loss of concentration or a mass pileup to wreck one 's chances in an instant and render even a talented rider powerless to keep up with a surging peloton racing at over 40kmph for the 3,664km of this year 's @entity16			1
thursday might offer further respite with a 185.5km leg from @entity154 to @entity155 , expected to favor sprinters such as @entity158 's @entity157 , who has already won three stages on this year 's race , including the opener where 25 - time stage winner @entity162 also crashed out .			0
