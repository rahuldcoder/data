jury selection is expected to begin monday in the trial of former @entity3 pitcher @entity2 , nine months after the previous one ended in a mistrial			1
federal prosecutors accuse @entity2 of lying to @entity7 when lawmakers investigated the illicit use of steroids in professional baseball			1
the case -- involving one count of obstruction of @entity7 , three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury -- was declared a mistrial in july after evidence previously ruled inadmissible was shown in court			1
it involved a video clip of a televised congressional hearing from 2008 in which a congressman referenced an affidavit from @entity27 about purported steroid use encountered by her husband , former @entity30 pitcher @entity29 , @entity2 and other players			2
@entity33 district court judge @entity32 ruled in pre-trial proceedings that @entity27 's testimony about steroid use was uncorroborated and inadmissible			0
most of the extended video had played for the jury , however , before the judge realized it included the prohibited discussion			0
prosecutors subsequently asked for a new trial , saying they did not intend to air the clip in question			0
" this was a mistake , a regretful mistake , " government attorney @entity46 said in september , urging @entity32 to reject a defense motion to dismiss the indictment and prevent a new trial			0
@entity32 blasted prosecutors , declaring , " i would hate to believe they just blatantly disregarded rulings that i made , but it 's hard for me to reach any other conclusion			0
" defense attorneys accused prosecutors of showing the clip deliberately and asked @entity32 to dismiss the six - count indictment			1
" no doubt this was a calculated effort to make an end run around this court 's ruling , " @entity2 defense attorney @entity61 said at the time			2
" the government 's use of this particular exhibit was premeditated , " the defense team wrote in a critique given to @entity32 in august , and was " not as innocent as the government suggests			0
" the charges stem from @entity2 ' 2008 testimony before the @entity75 , during which he denied using anabolic steroids			2
@entity2 has continually denied using performance - enhancing drugs during his professional baseball career .			1
