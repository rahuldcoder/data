@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 women 's soccer team won the @entity6 after defeating the @entity7 on penalty kicks sunday night , rallying from a pair of one - goal deficits to capture its first - ever world title			1
@entity5 had come into the tournament as sentimental favorites , helping rally a nation that had been devastated by a march 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami and nuclear disaster			1
for the @entity7 , it was more a disappointment -- especially considering that the team twice relinquished leads			2
while the @entity7 had the most chances during the run of play , the @entity5 dominated the penalty - kick phase 3 - 1 to earn the win			1
the @entity7 dug themselves a hole by missing their first three kicks			2
" we lost to a great team , we really did , " @entity7 goalkeeper @entity29 told @entity30 , which broadcast the game			1
" i truly believe that something bigger was pulling for this team			2
" @entity7 gathered in bars , living rooms and other places rode an emotional roller coaster , their hopes high on multiple occassions only to be dashed in the end			2
@entity5 residents were also glued to their televisions , despite the game starting around 4 a.m. local time			1
in one @entity49 eatery , for instances , scores adorned in the team 's colors burst out in joy once their team beat the @entity7 squad for the first time in 26 tries			1
the shoot - out was mandated only after @entity5 midfielder @entity58 scored with a few minutes left in extra time , tying the score 2 - 2			1
@entity5 answered a @entity7 goal -- also in the overtime period -- when @entity7 forward @entity63 put her team ahead by heading home a pass from @entity67 into the back of the net			1
there were many heroes for @entity5			2
one of them was @entity73 , who tied up the score with 10 minutes left in regulation by finishing off a scramble in front of the net			0
before then , @entity5 had its back against the wall after @entity67 herself scored the game 's first goal			1
this came after the @entity7 controlled much of the early action , but could n't capitalize			2
in the first - half alone , a @entity7 player hit a goal - post , and on another occasion , @entity63 rattled the crossbar			1
@entity5 also had its own point - blank chance about 30 minutes into the game ; that was saved by @entity94 , the @entity7 goalkeeper			1
it was more of the same in the second half , with @entity67 ringing a ball off the post from several feet away just three minutes in			0
then , @entity5 goalkeeper @entity100 tapped a @entity63 header just over the crossbar 15 minutes later			1
the game -- which began at 8:45 p.m. ( 2:45 p.m. et ) in @entity0 , @entity1 -- capped an eventful tournament that saw a number of favorites including @entity107 , @entity108 and the host nation of @entity1 fall by the wayside			0
the @entity5 shocked the host nation in the quarterfinals			1
in that same round , the @entity7 team needed last - minute heroics to beat @entity107 and advance			2

" anything that gets soccer played in the @entity7 is great , " @entity123 told @entity2 from a @entity130 bar , minutes after the contest ended			2
" and the fact that so many watched this game is awesome			0
" while the @entity7 team played for bragging rights and to boost the sport 's profile in their home country , @entity5 players were hoping to give their citizens something to smile about after this spring 's massive earthquake and tsunami			1
" to be in the final is , to be honest , like a dream , " @entity5 player @entity58 told @entity145 before the game			0
" we know @entity118 are a great and strong team , but they have weak points , too , and there 's always a chance to score			0
