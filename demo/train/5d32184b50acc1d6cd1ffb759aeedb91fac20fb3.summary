@entity0 -- @entity3 officials are revising the way they screen air passengers coming to the @entity3 , dropping measures hastily implemented after the @entity7 and replacing them with a plan to give airlines and other nations " real - time , threat - based intelligence " about potential terrorists			1
under the plan , the @entity13 would give airlines and other nations information gleaned from intelligence sources about potential terrorists -- information such as partial names , partial passport numbers and travel patterns of suspects			2
the plan retains existing no fly and selectee lists , as well as the random selection of some passengers for additional screening			0
but the plan scuttles a much - criticized program , implemented in the wake of the december 25 bombing attempt , that subjected virtually all travelers from 14 predominantly @entity36 countries to additional screening			1
" what we have done is changed the way we screen passengers who are coming internationally into the @entity3 , " said @entity38 secretary @entity37			1
" it is a more intel - or information - based way to screen			1
it 's a stronger way to determine whether passengers should go through secondary examination and not just primary examination			0
" the new security measures are the result of a review president @entity53 ordered after a @entity55 man allegedly tried to blow up a @entity57 flight from @entity58 , @entity59 , to @entity60 , @entity61 , on christmas day			1
the measures begin friday but will take a short time to implement fully , a senior administration official said			1
the @entity3 intelligence community will determine , based on threat information , which characteristics should be used to select passengers for secondary screening			1
race could be one distinguishing feature passed along , but " only when we have reliable intelligence that suggests that someone with that characteristic is a potential terrorist , " said the administration official			2
the official said the program did not involve racial profiling			0
the air carriers and international countries -- when they are the ones administering screening -- will have responsibility for pulling and screening passengers who meet the criteria			1
the official said there is no concern about providing too much intelligence to too many people			2
security partners will be given what they need to identify people for additional screening and no more			2
the new security regime requires cooperation from the airlines and other governments , but the official does not anticipate compliance problems			2
" it is in their interest to ensure the safety of their flights , " the official said			0
the @entity3 will do inspections , and there will be penalties for not complying			0
the recent case of @entity113 showed how " fragmentary intelligence " can be used to help stop a potential terrorist , two administration officials said			2
in march , @entity113 pleaded guilty to helping plan the november 2008 @entity117 , @entity118 , terror attacks , and another attack that was never carried out on a @entity122 newspaper that published controversial cartoons about the prophet @entity124			2
based on intelligence , including a partial name and travel information , @entity128 did additional screening of travelers entering the @entity3 and was able to identify @entity113			1
since the failed @entity7 attack , @entity132 has participated in aviation summits in @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and other places to forge agreements and to strengthen ways information can be shared around the aviation community , a senior administration official said			1
@entity132 has suggested the @entity143 , a @entity144 agency , set standards that would apply to all international airports , strengthening weak links in the security chain			0
@entity150 privacy laws have stymied previous @entity3 efforts to gain access to passenger information			0
full - body scanners improve security , @entity13 says " i believe that this is a more effective security strategy , " said sen. @entity156 , @entity157 , ranking member of the @entity158			1
" applying a kind of blanket , ' one - size - fits - all ' scrutiny to individuals based solely on their country of origin provides only limited additional security and helps terrorists avoid detection by using operatives from other countries to carry out their plots			1
" rep. @entity173 , @entity157 - @entity174 , ranking member of the @entity175 , called the change a " significant step forward " but criticized the @entity177 for not briefing @entity178 before announcing the change			0
" this is yet another instance of homeland security adviser @entity182 and other @entity177 staff withholding important security information from @entity178 , " he said			0
the @entity185 , a religious rights organization , also said it welcomed the change , highlighting the decision to end the " 14 country " directive			0
" because the policy focused solely on national origin and not individual behavior , it effectively made profiling the law of the @entity3 , " the group said			0
" its rescission is a step in the right direction towards ending profiling by the federal government			0
" @entity1 's @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			0

new : policy of extra scrutiny for those from 14 mostly @entity36 countries dropped
new rules to deal with " real - time , threat - based intelligence , " @entity38 chief says
air security measures will replace ones added after failed @entity7 attack
