-- we all know this election is going to be about the economy			0
president @entity4 knows it , @entity6 knows it and so do the media -- even though at times pundits pretend it 's about much smaller and sillier topics			1
the difference , as the president told the country last week , is that he is the only candidate in the race who truly understands that it 's about a very specific part of our economy : the middle class			1
@entity4 's plan is to grow the economy from the middle out , using common - sense measures that help small businesses , invest in clean - energy technology and train a new generation of skilled workers			1
@entity6 's plan is to return to the same failed , trickle - down policies -- but made worse by the tea party politics of slash - and - burn against government -- that threaten hardworking middle - class families			1
those are two very different visions			0
where do they come from ? both candidates have looked at the same history but derive very different lessons			0
@entity4 studied how the middle class was built -- sending students and veterans to school , developing a strong manufacturing base and making sure our laboratories of innovation are built on @entity50 soil and grit			1
that foundation created a great @entity50 middle class that became the envy of the world			1
in the @entity57 years , private - sector businesses created 23 million new jobs			0
the president is determined to rebuild the foundation that led to such historic success			0
@entity6 , on the other hand , has fixated on the failed ideas of the last decade			1
he endorsed eliminating the rules that protect our workers and keep corporations from gambling away our money			0
he was all for giving the wealthy a permanent break on taxes -- and wants to increase the nation 's debt by having us pay for more tax havens for the rich			2
@entity6 wants to return to policies that funneled wealth upward and pushed the middle class down -- and almost out			1
like the @entity4 campaign says about @entity6 's broken promises in @entity82 : it did n't work then , and it wo n't work now			1
you do n't have to take my word for it			0
independent economists have said @entity6 's warmed - over ideas would pull us back toward recession at the very time we need to keep pushing toward a full recovery			2
@entity4 's correct reading of history is why he 's made the decisions he has in his first term -- even when they were politically unpopular			2
when the auto industry started to collapse and factories began shutting their doors , @entity4 knew that , as a country , we needed to rescue it			2
now @entity50 car companies and @entity50 manufacturers are surging , opening new factories and hiring new workers			0
@entity6 has been forthright : he would have let the companies go into bankruptcy in a process experts said would have shuttered the factories and led the workers to lose their jobs			2
@entity4 also found a housing market in which thousands of @entity50 were going into foreclosure			2
he fought to keep people in their homes despite being obstructed at every turn by republicans in @entity119 who tried to make it impossible for struggling homeowners to refinance or renegotiate their mortgages			0
@entity6 , of course , has no plan to help underwater homeowners			2
we 've got a long way to go , but the president 's policies have stopped the bleeding of jobs			0
since june 2009 , when the stimulus took effect , the private sector has been adding jobs -- and if not for @entity139 obstruction of recovery efforts , there would have been a dramatically greater increase in employment			0
and despite all his talk of business expertise , @entity6 ranked 47th out of 50 in job creation when he was governor of @entity82			2
this is a choice between two courses of action , but it is also a choice between two different visions			0
@entity4 was buoyed up on a groundswell of small donors , young and old , rich and poor -- people who wished to see a country restored and an economy rebuilt			1
@entity6 was chosen by the same class of the @entity139 elite who met in the early days of january 2009 and vowed to block @entity4 at every turn			1
while the president promised to make his top priority the success of the middle class , @entity139 declared the president 's failure their no. 1 objective			1
read @entity169 's view : @entity4 's message of divide and blame @entity4 has kept faith with the middle class and kept his focus on moving forward			1
he has pushed for a just budget and a fair tax code to relieve our deficit			0
he will encourage companies to bring their jobs and profits back to our shores , hire new workers , invest in research and technology , rebuild our roads and bridges , and invest in promising new sources of energy			0
his vision is based on action , while @entity6 's is based on inaction : " let @entity195 go bankrupt , " let foreclosures " hit the bottom , " and wait , wait , wait for wealth to trickle down -- which it has never done and will never do for the middle class			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 : president @entity4 truly understands how to build up the middle class
@entity203 : @entity4 *favors* *education* , manufacturing , innovations to build middle class
@entity203 : @entity6 wants tax breaks for the rich as middle class waits for trickling down
@entity203 : @entity6 says let " @entity195 go bankrupt , " let foreclosures " hit bottom "
