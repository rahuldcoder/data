convicted @entity2 match - fixer @entity0 is categorically denying a story published by @entity5 weekly @entity4 alleging that the @entity7 team was involved in fixing a @entity9 game in @entity10			1
the @entity7 federation -- known as @entity12 -- has pledged to investigate @entity4 's allegations , which focused on the national side 's second group a game against @entity17 -- purportedly based on an interview with @entity0			1
" contrary to the ' revelations ' published by the @entity5 weekly @entity4 that were picked up by news outlets worldwide , i did not predict the result of the @entity7 vs. @entity17 match played on june 18 , 2014 , " said @entity0 in a statement published online			1
" the @entity25 chat with the @entity4 journalist took place a few days after the match -- june 21 -- as confirmed by my @entity25 log , and was but an informal assessment of the behavior of the @entity7 team at the @entity31 after they had played two of their three group stage matches , including the one with @entity17			1
" @entity36 has been sent screen grabs of two @entity25 conversations between @entity39 and the journalist , @entity40 , by the fixer 's representative			2
the first is dated the june 21 and the second is dated the june 26 -- in other words after the @entity17 game -- where @entity0 talks of " five to seven black sheeps , " and " seven rotten apples " within the @entity7 team , adding " in my opinion they fixed all three matches			1
" @entity0 's @entity25 account does not show public updates , so @entity36 was unable to independently verify those exchanges			0
" at no time did i make reference to four goals being scored or to a red card being issued , " @entity0 said			0
" at no time did i suggest that i had any way of corroborating or substantiating what was meant to be an educated guess based on my extensive match - fixing experience , " added @entity0 , who was arrested in @entity59 in 2011 and sentenced to two years in prison for fixing games in @entity62 , northern @entity63			2
" last but not least : at no time was i informed by the @entity4 journalist that our chat was going to end up in the @entity5 publication			1
" the @entity4 journalist , @entity40 , told @entity36 that the publication was confident in its reporting of the story			1
" we firmly stand by our assertion that mr. @entity0 wrote in a @entity25 chat with @entity4 some hours before the @entity9 match @entity17 vs. @entity7 , that the result of the match will be a 4 - 0 victory for @entity17 and that a player of @entity7 will get a red card in the first half , " @entity40 said			1
that alleged prediction largely came true			0
midfielder @entity84 was red - carded during the game for lashing out at @entity17 striker @entity86 , who scored twice in a 4 - 0 victory along with goals from @entity89 and @entity90			1
@entity36 contacted @entity84 's agent but he was not immediately available for comment			0
now living in @entity93 , @entity0 recently published a book -- " @entity95 " -- about his involvement in illegal match fixing , which was written in conjunction with investigative journalists @entity99 and @entity101			0
" i apologize to the @entity102 and to its fans if i inadvertently offended them ; it was not my intention , " said @entity0			0
" i strongly believe that @entity4 should also do the same since they placed words in my mouth that i did not utter			0
" " @entity95 " examines three decades of match - fixing efforts , including @entity9 qualifiers , @entity110 matches and the @entity111			2
" i am now back in @entity93 where i have testified against my former associates in a local match - fixing trial , " said @entity0			2
" ' @entity95 ' is an honest account of what my life has been like until today			0
" i have now turned a new leaf and wish to put my expertise at the disposal of those willing to truly fight the scourge of match - fixing			2
" when the time is ripe i will share what i know with @entity125 and @entity126 , but i will not accept that my statements be manipulated at the detriment of others			0
" a @entity125 spokesperson told reporters tuesday that football 's governing body could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the alleged manipulation of the @entity7 - @entity17 match			1
@entity12 said in a statement monday that " in 55 years of existence , it has never been sanctioned for , involved in , or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind			0
