-- it was @entity3 's long - held dream			1
to build the best links golf course in the world in @entity6 , as a tribute to his late mother who was born in the country			2

with the @entity20 ready for action from july , @entity3 has shelved plans for an adjoining hotel until a decision is made on the wind farm			1
blowing in the wind : @entity3 to ditch $ 1bn @entity6 golf resort ? and he was in @entity6 this week to accuse the government of luring him into his Â £ 1 bn project by telling him the offshore developemtn would never be built			1
he told @entity0 he plans to sue , unless the development is abandoned			2
" if an administration that 's previous gives a statement , and if you rely on that statement , and then you build and spend tens of millions of pounds in this case , building this great course -- if you do that and rely on certain statements , and the next administration say ' well , we 're not going to ( do that ) ' , then i think that is unfair			0
. " i do n't think that is good business			0
i think people looking to invest in @entity6 will look at this and say ' well , we 'll invest some place else			0
' " i will sue if they try to advance it further , i will be suing @entity6			2
" @entity3 said he would never have begun his project on the east coast of @entity6 if he thought the mooted wind farm was a possibility			1

@entity3 told the committee that pursuing the construction of wind farms could , in his opinion , be the ruination of @entity6			1
" the last thing i needed was to build a course in @entity6 , " he told @entity0			2
" but the land was so incredible and in honor of my mother , who was born in @entity6 , i thought it 'd be a great idea			0
" so i decided to do it and it came out even better than i thought			0
" two groups of protestors gathered outside the @entity6 parliament for @entity3 's visit -- those who support his opposition to wind farms , and those who claim his development has spoiled an area of outstanding natural beauty			1
but advocates of @entity6 's policy of embracing renewable energy projects insist the government should not be blown off course by entrepreneurs like @entity3			1
@entity91 , ceo of @entity92 , insists the country 's reputation for being at the forefront of the sustainable energy campaign must be maintained			0
