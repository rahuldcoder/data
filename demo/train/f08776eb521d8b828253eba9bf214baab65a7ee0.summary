-- @entity1 is 66 and has spent nearly all of his seventh decade in a @entity4 prison after his conviction on kidnapping , armed robbery and other charges for busting into a @entity10 casino to try to reclaim items he felt were rightfully his			1
and he 's had enough			0
his nearly five years in custody " have been somewhat illuminating at times and painful a lot of times , " @entity13 told two @entity4 parole board members thursday via closed - circuit tv from prison			1
" i missed my two younger kids who worked hard getting through high school , i missed their college graduations , " he said , seemingly emotional as he talked			0
" i missed my sister 's funeral			0
i missed all the birthdays			0
" the football legend could learn whether he 'll have less time to spend in prison in two weeks , when the parole board comes back with its decision			1
if a majority of the seven on the parole board vote in his favor , he 'll have some hope but wo n't be free , according to multiple reports , including from @entity0 affiliates @entity39 and @entity40			1
that 's because he 'd still have to serve more of his term -- at least four years more , according to these reports			1
in his worst case scenario , @entity13 remains behind bars for decades more			2
after his 2008 conviction , he was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison			1
watch : the rise and fall of @entity1 @entity13 portrayed himself as a model inmate since his arrival , saying he had promised prison officials " i would be the best prisoner they have ever had here , ( and ) i think , for the most part , i 've kept my word on that			1
" recalling conversations with other inmates , specifically the many like him who are incarcerated for trying to rob others , @entity13 said his case stands out -- and , because of that , he should have his prison term cut			1
" the difference between all of their crimes and mine is that they were trying to steal other people 's property , they were trying to steal other people 's money , " the pro football hall - of - famer argued			0
" my crime was trying to retrieve , for my family , my own property			0
" a @entity4 jury , however , did n't see it that way			1
they convicted him on october 3 , 2008 -- the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife , @entity13 , and @entity84			1
the former @entity87 winner , record - setting @entity88 running back and movie actor had enlisted the help of @entity91 and four others to get sports memorabilia that @entity13 claimed belonged to him from dealers @entity94 and @entity96			2
the six men confronted the dealers in a room at @entity10 ' @entity100 on september 13 , 2007 , brandishing weapons but not firing them			2
four of those men testified against @entity13 -- each getting probation in exchange for his testimony -- while @entity91 stood trial alongside him			2
so does @entity13 regret what he did ? watch : @entity1 on 2007 conviction : " i thought i was innocent			1
" on thursday , as he did during his trial and has in subsequent appeals , he went on the defensive			0
@entity13 said he 'd talked with his kids , his sister and his brother - in - law -- the latter two , he said , " were originally going to go with me " -- before going to the hotel			1
he also talked with two lawyers , one he knew and another he did n't			0
" my intent was not to rob from anybody , " said the onetime @entity119 and @entity120 great			0
" i knew both of these guys who had my stuff			0
i was a little upset with them , and i think i was n't as civil as i should have been			0
" one mistake he admits : bringing " some guys with me who i did n't know and one i did n't trust			0
" " and that 's on me , " @entity13 said			2
" for that , i 've been here for five years			0
" @entity132 was one of those who did n't buy similar arguments during @entity13 's trial			2
while @entity132 was an alternate juror , he did agree with the verdict			0
talking with @entity0 earlier this week before thursday 's parole board hearing , @entity132 did n't say specifically whether he thought @entity13 should walk free now			1
but he did say the 33 - year maximum sentence " seems like a lot for what he did in that scenario			2
" " i would have thought 10 or 15 years , " @entity132 said			0
" ( the longer sentence ) made me think that ... was there some bias there , maybe ? maybe they were thinking about the old trial ? " gallery : the rise and fall of @entity1 @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			1
