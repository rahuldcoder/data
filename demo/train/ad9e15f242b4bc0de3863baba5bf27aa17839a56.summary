@entity0 , @entity1 -- religious leaders in @entity4 on friday hit back at claims by leading physicist @entity6 that @entity7 had no role in the creation of the universe			1
in his new book " @entity15 , " @entity4 's most famous scientist says that given the existence of gravity , " the universe can and will create itself from nothing , " according to an excerpt published in @entity14			1
" spontaneous creation is the reason why there is something rather than nothing , why the universe exists , why we exist , " he wrote			0
" it is not necessary to invoke @entity7 to light the blue touch paper [ fuse ] and set the universe going			1
" but the head of the @entity32 , the archbishop of @entity35 dr. @entity34 , told the @entity14 that " physics on its own will not settle the question of why there is something rather than nothing			1
" he added : " belief in @entity7 is not about plugging a gap in explaining how one thing relates to another within the @entity45			1
it is the belief that there is an intelligent , living agent on whose activity everything ultimately depends for its existence			2
" @entity34 ' comments were supported by leaders from across the religious spectrum in @entity4			2
writing in the @entity14 , chief rabbi @entity54 said : " science is about explanation			0
religion is about interpretation ... the @entity59 simply is n't interested in how the @entity45 came into being			0
" the archbishop of westminster @entity60 , leader of the @entity63 , added : " i would totally endorse what the chief rabbi said so eloquently about the relationship between religion and science			0
" @entity69 , an imam and committee chairman at the @entity71 , was also quoted by the @entity14 as saying : " if we look at the @entity45 and all that has been created , it indicates that somebody has been here to bring it into existence			0
that somebody is the almighty conqueror			0
" @entity6 was also accused of " missing the point " by colleagues at the @entity82 in @entity1			2
" the ' god ' that @entity6 is trying to debunk is not the creator @entity7 of the @entity88 faiths who really is the ultimate explanation for why there is something rather than nothing , " said @entity83 , director of the @entity84			1
" @entity6 's god is a god - of - the - gaps used to plug present gaps in our scientific knowledge			1
" science provides us with a wonderful narrative as to how [ existence ] may happen , but theology addresses the meaning of the narrative , " he added			0
read why @entity6 says @entity7 did n't create the universe @entity105 , an @entity32 priest and @entity82 expert in the history of science , said that it 's not the existence of the universe that proves the existence of @entity7			1
" a creator @entity7 provides a reasonable and credible explanation of why there is a universe , and ... it is somewhat more likely that there is a @entity7 than that there is not			1
that view is not undermined by what @entity6 has said			2
" @entity6 's book -- as the title suggests -- is an attempt to answer " the @entity124 , " he wrote , quoting @entity126 ' cult science fiction romp , " @entity127			1
" read @entity2 's @entity128 his answer is " m - theory , " which , he says , posits 11 space - time dimensions , " vibrating strings , ... point particles , two - dimensional membranes , three - dimensional blobs and other objects that are more difficult to picture and occupy even more dimensions of space			0
" he does n't explain much of that in the excerpt , which is the introduction to the book			0
but he says he understands the feeling of the great @entity1 scientist @entity143 that @entity7 did " create " and " conserve " order in the universe			1
it was the discovery of other solar systems outside our own in 1992 that undercut a key idea of @entity143 's -- that our world was so uniquely designed to be comfortable for human life that some divine creator must have been responsible			0
but , @entity6 argues , if there are untold numbers of planets in the galaxy , it 's less remarkable that there 's one with conditions for human life			2
and , indeed , he argues , any form of intelligent life that evolves anywhere will automatically find that it lives somewhere suitable for it			0
@entity2 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
