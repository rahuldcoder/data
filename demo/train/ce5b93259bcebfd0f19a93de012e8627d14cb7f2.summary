-- flight - phobics , relax -- a list of the world 's safest airlines has just been released			1
@entity5 of the ranking from @entity7 of the safest carriers in 2013 is the @entity10 airline @entity9			1
awarding it a full seven stars , the website cites the airline 's fatality - free flying record from the beginning of the jet era in the early 1950s			2
other airlines sharing the seven - star rating and winning a place among the top 10 safest airlines are , in alphabetical order , @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity23			1
safest industries commercial aviation is one of the most heavily monitored industries in the world and statistically the much - cited comparison bears out : you are much less likely to die in an airplane crash than in a car accident			1
indeed , the number of fatalities last year was at a record low , according to the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			0
many airlines go for years without experiencing significant safety incidents , let alone a crash			2
there is thus often little to distinguish the largest and most reliable carriers apart from a safety point of view			0
of the 448 airlines @entity50 surveys , 137 have a top seven - star rating			1
along with fatality crash records and audits from aviation governing bodies , the website takes into account the quality of the " in - flight product " airlines offer -- including in - flight entertainment , seating and food -- to determine their ranking			1
concentrate on the movie nonetheless , it 's useful know some of the airlines to consider booking if you 'd prefer to concentrate on the inflight movie rather than rejigging your last will and testament in your head			0
probably not among them , however , is @entity72 , the unfortunately named @entity74 airline that shares a one - star ranking with the @entity77 @entity76 and the @entity78			1
all are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the @entity82			1
quite what the one star is for is n't revealed -- perhaps just getting off the ground			0
it 's certainly not for brand name development in the case of @entity72			0
of the carriers awarded two stars , three are from @entity91 and one each from @entity77 , the @entity26 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
the @entity95 does n't blacklist individual airlines , but it does make public a list of countries , including @entity91 , that it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards			2
record year dubious names and rankings aside , nervous flyers should be breathing easier			0
last year was the safest for flying since 1945 , with 269 deaths from 29 accidents , the @entity43 records			1
that compares with a far higher 10 - year average of 719 fatalities and 32 accidents annually ( involving planes with a minimum passenger capacity of 14 )			2
" the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline , " said the @entity43 president , @entity113 , " probably for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety - driven efforts by international aviation organizations			0
" however , the picture is uneven worldwide			0
with one - fifth of all fatal airliner accidents but only around 3 % of global aircraft departures , @entity121 remains the least safe continent for flying			2
yet the worst accident last year was in @entity126			1
a @entity128 @entity127 from @entity129 to @entity130 crashed and exploded into flames on landing on november 17 , killing all 44 passengers and six crew aboard			0
the @entity126 carrier receives only four stars from @entity7 because of its failure to complete the " critical " @entity137			0
airlines that have completed the audit have a 77 % better safety record than those that have n't , the website reports .			0
