-- when this season 's @entity3 alpine ski champions stepped up to the podium to receive their prizes , they were following in some famous footsteps			2
the @entity8 , designer @entity9 , @entity10 and boxing star @entity11 have all been there			0
no , not the @entity15 winners ' pantheon			1
not yet at least ( although @entity17 's appearance at february 's @entity18 should offer some encouragement to wannabe ski - celebs )			1
each has been the recipient of a piece of fine crystal designed and manufactured by @entity24 , a @entity26 glassblowing specialist			2
the @entity28 - based company is renowned as the maker of awards presented to many a famous face -- also including @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 -- but it is perhaps best known for the iconic @entity3 globes that are dished out to the kings and queens of the snow			2
some 64 @entity3 trophies are awarded yearly to the discipline and overall winners at the various @entity15 ski , snowboard , @entity46 , ski - jump and cross-country @entity3 finals events			1
recipients in 2014 have included alpine skiers @entity51 and @entity52 , who posed for the cameras with the freshest batch after picking up the overall titles for the ladies ' and men 's events respectively this month			1
yet behind these triumphant images of sporting glory lies a tale of intricate craftsmanship that is as painstaking in its quest for perfection as the preparations of any winter athlete			0
a glass apart founded in 1960 , @entity68 began as a glass - cutting enterprise before later adding a blowing factory , specialist engraving facility and hand - painting operations			0
it first manufactured the crystal sphere trophies in 1987 , with the first @entity15 globe handed over in 1989			1
the process has since become part of winter sports tradition			0
where football has its 18 carat gold @entity3 trophy and ice hockey the silver and nickel @entity84 , winter sports have the crystal globe			1
" every season we have 33 of the small cups ( for the winners of individual events ) , 17 of the big cups ( for the overall winners ) , 17 for the nations cups and 177 medals of glass , " @entity68 's operations manager @entity88 told @entity0 's @entity90 series			1
" i think of the last 25 years we have made over 2,000 different small and big cups			1
" @entity88 says the production of a @entity3 trophy spans two days and a number of complex stages			0
each is primarily forged using a 1,200 - degree @entity107 mass of molten glass which is then painstakingly shaped by @entity68 's glassblowers			1
these skilled technicians inflate the hot glass to the required shape via a blowpipe , sweating profusely as they go			0
after a 24 - hour cooling off period , the trophy is brought to a glasscutter who uses diamond disks to carve an intricate snow crystal design into the trophies			1
the @entity15 logos , the relevant discipline and sponsor names are then engraved into the glass			2
once finished , the selected globes are packed up into specially designed shipping cases and transported from @entity68 headquarters to the relevant @entity3 venue			0
of the hundreds of globes made each year , only the finest are used -- @entity68 selects the 33 best trophies out of a total of 60 smaller globes produced annually			1
an emotional send - off having worked at the @entity68 for nigh on 42 years , @entity88 has seen hundreds of athletes pick up his company 's prized trophies			1
he attended this month 's @entity3 finals and was as effusive as ever on witnessing the world 's best skiers , snowboarders and cross-country athletes ' joy at receiving the fruits of his company 's labors			0
" that 's a beautiful feeling			0
i ( have ) watched all the @entity3 finals the last 25 years and we are very proud when the winners have our product , " he said			0
" this goes out around the world and we are very proud -- the winner looks at the trophy and says it 's a wonderful trophy			0
" @entity68 also manufactures trophies for cycling 's @entity157 as well as the @entity26 and @entity160 football federations			2
but while fond of these items , @entity88 believes there is something unique about the @entity3 globes			0
" ( this is an ) absolutely special design which displays a globe for the best in skiing , " he said			2
those winter sportsmen and women fortunate enough to have their hands on the prized crystal will be sure to agree			0
