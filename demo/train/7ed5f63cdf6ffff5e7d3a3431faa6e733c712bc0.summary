-- @entity1 had fallen when the men heard the sounds on the mountain			0
first it was a chime , then a recitation of verses , followed by the crackle of wood burning			0
they scrambled to the summit to see what was happening			0
there , seated with his palms together and facing west , was their friend			0
@entity16 leapt around the peaceful man , engulfing him			0
it was just as he 'd intended			0
this story of @entity21 , a @entity22 monk , is told in @entity25 's " burning for the @entity24 : @entity26 in @entity27			1
" @entity25 , an associate professor of religion at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , writes that the act of setting one 's self on fire dates back in @entity37 @entity22 tradition to the late fourth century			1
but no matter how old , self - immolation still leaves people horrified , riveted and moved			1
the popular uprising that led to the toppling of @entity43 's government began after @entity44 , an unemployed 26 - year - old college graduate , ignited himself in protest and died earlier this month			1
since then , a wave of self - immolations has rolled through @entity48 , with other incidents in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
" there 's something so primal , so dramatic			1
... it 's meant to be noticed , " said @entity55 , a professor who 's specialized in freedom of expression at the @entity58 at the @entity59			1
it seems to " demand some kind of reparation			0
" though the history of self - immolation may run more than 1,500 years deep , the western world woke up to it in the 1960s			1
the iconic june 1963 image of @entity69 , a @entity70 @entity22 monk , surrounded by flames in a busy @entity73 intersection was seared into @entity75 consciousness			1
he was protesting the persecution of @entity77 by the @entity70 government , and his actions are often seen as having helped spark the regime 's overthrow later that year			2
others followed his example , not just in @entity84 but in the @entity85 , too			0
in march 1965 , an 82 - year - old woman , @entity86 , protested the ongoing @entity87 by setting herself on fire on a @entity90 , @entity91 , street corner			1
@entity92 , 31 , ignited himself eight months later outside the @entity93 , beneath the office window of defense secretary @entity95			2
the following week , @entity96 , 22 , did the same in front of @entity101 's @entity100 building			2
in other countries , too , self - immolations have played a part in political and social movements			1
there was @entity107 , a 20 - year - old student who in 1969 very publicly set himself on fire in @entity109 , @entity110 , protesting @entity112 apathy five months after the @entity114 occupation			2
@entity115 , a 54 - year - old woman , did it in @entity117 in 1994 to demonstrate for women 's rights after the @entity119			1
and a group of five burned together in 2001 at @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity37 , though three survived and the motivations are a matter of debate			1
see more images of provocative political protests people have reportedly self - immolated in response to communist regimes in @entity131 and @entity132 , taxes in @entity134 , the kidnapping of children by @entity138 police			1
it 's been done in @entity140 to protest the @entity142 's condemnation of homosexuality , in @entity144 to protest a film screening , and in the @entity147 after an asylum claim was rejected			2
the list of locations , and reasons , goes on			0
but beyond political or social motivations , can faith inspire someone to burn themselves alive -- as it apparently did for @entity21 in 527 ? of the well - known @entity85 cases , which represent a diversity of backgrounds , it 's next to impossible to say			1
@entity86 , the 82 - year - old @entity84 protester , was an immigrant of @entity160 descent and had reportedly spent time in an internment camp during @entity163 , who died outside the @entity93 , was a @entity165			2
@entity96 , who protested in flames in front of the @entity100 , was a former seminary student and a member of the @entity169 in other cases , self - immolation has been more clearly linked to religious belief			2
though outlawed in @entity144 for nearly two centuries , some @entity174 communities practiced the ritual of sati -- in which a widowed @entity174 woman would throw herself , or be thrown , on her husband 's funeral pyre			2
in @entity27 , the subject of self - immolation is controversial , said @entity183 , the chair of the @entity184 at the @entity185			2
" many ( @entity22 ) schools strongly condemn suicide , " he said , " but at the same time , in @entity189 , self - immolation has been practiced on and off for well over a thousand years			1
" like most religions , he said , the canonical literature is so vast that , if you dig deep enough , you can find teachings to fit your needs			0
enter the @entity195 , considered one of the most significant @entity22 scriptures in @entity189			1
there 's a small passage in one chapter that speaks of a @entity200 , one with great spiritual and moral wisdom			2
" @entity202 tells us that as an offering to the @entity24 and to display his insight that the body is not a permanent , unchanging self , he poured fragrant oil on himself and allowed himself to be burned by fire , " wrote @entity22 monk , author , teacher and peace activist @entity213 is his book , " @entity215 , @entity216			1
" " this is a quite radical demonstration of his freedom and insight , one that was made out of a very deep love , " he wrote			0
and it was this part of the @entity195 that @entity70 monks and nuns pointed to when it came to self - immolation in the 1960s			1
but people do n't burn themselves to death " simply because the @entity195 says to do it , " emphasized @entity185 's @entity183			1
" while it is an extreme and contentious practice , some @entity77 regard it as the ultimate form of self - sacrifice , justified in times of social crisis to bring about political transformation			1
" as for the recent self - immolations in @entity48 , @entity238 said they are about sought - after change , not about religion			1
" western media still highly exaggerate the role and influence of @entity251 in political behavior and actions ( and even violence by ) @entity255 and @entity256 , " said @entity238 , a political science professor at @entity243 , @entity244 , and a blogger for a site called @entity247			0
" the @entity43 uprising is clearly a secular event , and the @entity251 have no role whatsoever in it			1
not all actions by @entity255 are derived by @entity251 notions and principles			0
" he said there 's " no basis in @entity251 for self - immolations " and that the practice came from " @entity268 societies			1
" what 's happening now " reveals not an attempt to express oneself islamically , so to speak , but to express oneself in an act that draws attention and sympathy and shows the outrage experienced by the oppressed @entity255 population			1
" @entity279 , the @entity59 communications professor , echoed his sentiments			0
" these young men represent a fairly dispossessed class , " she said			0
" it 's as if they 're offering up all that they have , their bodies , on behalf of the needs of their group			2
" though the intentions of those who ignite themselves can not always be known , some trends can be surmised -- especially when those who act do n't succeed in dying			2
@entity0 's senior international correspondent @entity296 wrote in late november about a surge in female self - immolation cases in @entity299 , @entity300			1
" they had set fire to themselves , so oppressed and desperate were they to escape abusive bad marriages , " he wrote			0
the number of cases " had doubled in the past year , " a doctor told him			0
some stories of self - immolations have become iconic			1
they , like the case of @entity44 , seemed to galvanize others and force change			0
in the @entity85 , decades past @entity84 , at least two additional cases are thought to have been , at least in part , politically motivated , although the mental states of those who acted have been questioned			0
@entity319 , 52 , lit himself on fire near a downtown @entity323 , @entity322 , expressway in 2006			0
the musician and activist was said to be protesting the war in @entity327 , but he was also reportedly a recovering alcoholic who battled depression			0
ten years before @entity319 set himself ablaze , a middle - aged woman did the same on @entity59 's campus in front of an outdoor sculpture of the peace symbol , @entity279 said			1
" she was a very tall , willowy woman who would dance , " across the campus , " @entity279 said			0
" she left a suicide note			0
and the saddest part of it was she had this idea that if she burned herself it would stop everyone in their tracks , and everyone would be good to each other			0
" @entity345 , the director of @entity347 's @entity346 in @entity348 , @entity349 , was a sociology professor at @entity59 at that time			2
in a letter he wrote to the student paper , the @entity350 , @entity345 -- who would later be asked to speak at @entity353 's memorial service -- challenged students to not simply write her off as " deranged			2
" " she was the ' dancing lady ' who often floated through campus waving a banner , spouting some vague references to love and political change			0
she was one of those characters who bring color to a college campus -- hard to ignore , but easy to dismiss -- and her final protest had the same character , " he wrote			0
" let us , for a moment , give her the respect of taking her act seriously			0
what is it you would sacrifice your time and effort -- if not your life -- for ? "			0

self - immolations are in the news , after @entity43 's act spawns others in @entity48
in the @entity37 @entity22 tradition , the practice dates back more than 1,500 years
westerners woke up to it in the 1960s , after monk ignited self on @entity73 street
people across globe have since self - immolated , but not always to the same effect
