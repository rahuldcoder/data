@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the director of a leading research center on child abuse , i have seen all too often that what a parent considers legitimate discipline can quickly deteriorate into violence fueled by anger			1
parents often say that they spank their children to teach them how to behave			1
the word discipline means " to teach , " but does spanking really teach children to behave , or does it teach them to solve problems with violence ? at our center , we see many parents who spank their children to teach them not to hit their siblings			1
spanking impressionable children may reduce undesirable behavior in the short term			1
in the long term , however , research shows that it offers children a poor example of how to solve problems or deal with difficult situations			1
the posting of the video of a @entity33 judge beating his 16 - year - old daughter with a belt , and the controversy surrounding deaths purportedly associated with the pro-spanking book " to train up a child , " have reignited the debate about corporal punishment			2
even those viewing the disturbing video differ on whether or not it reflects the appropriate use of discipline			0
when does spanking cross the line and become physical abuse ? although corporal punishment has been widely accepted throughout the history of the @entity51 , psychologists and other professionals here are increasingly concerned about the harm it may cause			1
many other countries have outlawed the practice , including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
despite growing evidence against and opposition to corporal punishment in the @entity51 , the practice remains accepted by nearly half of adults and is legal in all states			1
among scientists , there is a consensus that actual physical abuse damages children , directly and over the course of a life			2
although not all children who have been abused are affected the same way , decades of research show that child abuse initiates a cascade of negative social , emotional and health - related outcomes			1
" corporal punishment is of limited effectiveness and has potentially deleterious side effects , " the @entity85 has said in a policy statement			0
a 2002 analysis of studies , published in the @entity92 , concluded that although corporal punishment can make a child obey in the short run , it also is linked with a number of long - term problems , including mental disorders and behavioral difficulties			1
spanking in childhood also has been related to criminality			2
too much corporal punishment can also damage the parent - child relationship , as the parent becomes a source of both nurturing and danger			0
disconcertingly , spanking in childhood also is associated with approval of hitting a spouse and increased marital conflict			0
all the evidence and warnings , however , do n't always stop parents from hitting their kids			0
personal experiences and emotion continue to dictate whether or not parents choose physical punishment			0
the video of the judge beating his daughter is disturbing not only because of the physical violence , but also because of the emotional abuse that is clearly present			0
rather than learning not to download computer files , this girl may be learning to hide her behavior from her parents , to avoid bringing them her questions and concerns			0
she may become more likely to resolve conflict with violence , to become involved with people who are abusive , and eventually to hit her own children			1
all parents surely want to raise well - adjusted children			2
discipline and structure are key components of doing so			0
it would be @entity143 ve to think that even the most dedicated parents do not sometimes become frustrated with defiant children			0
there are many ways of disciplining children that are effective and nonviolent			0
we need to show parents what they are , and to make alternative approaches more widely accessible if we are to avoid tragic outcomes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

@entity158 : does spanking teach children to behave , or does it *encourage* violence ?
research shows that it offers children a poor example of how to solve problems , @entity158 says
@entity158 : many countries have outlawed spanking , yet most @entity51 think it *'s* ok
many studies link spanking with a number of long - term problems , @entity158 says
