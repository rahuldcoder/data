whether you 're a three - pack - a - day smoker who does n't like being lectured to about the health risks , or you 're a person who does n't touch cigarettes and would n't smoke one if you were offered a @entity7 in exchange , picture this : imagine , for a moment , that cigarettes had never been invented			1
and that in 2013 an eager entrepreneur went to the @entity11 seeking approval for a new product -- cigarettes -- that he wanted to sell to the @entity16 people			1
imagine that the @entity11 , taking its time and doing its homework , came up with all the currently available medical evidence about the dangers of smoking			1
whether you 're a smoker or not , you know what the @entity11 's response would be to that hypothetical entrepreneur : they 'd laugh him out of the room			1
they 'd ask him why he was wasting their time			2
they might , if they were feisty enough , point out the deadly impact of what he was asking them to authorize , and say to him : " there 's a legal term for knowingly causing death to people			2
in asking us to approve your product , sir , are you not setting us up to become accessories to murder ? " but cigarettes are not a new product			1
they are perfectly legal in all 50 states , and they 're going to stay that way			2
which is why two cigarette - related events last week are so instructive			2
the federal government gave up its highly publicized battle to make every package of cigarettes carry large , gruesome - looking illustrations			1
@entity11 changes course on graphic warning labels for cigarettes the proposed illustrations -- they included images of a diseased lung , of a tracheotomy hole in a man 's throat , of rotting teeth -- were rolled out with great fanfare in 2010			1
the government wanted the illustrations to cover the entire top half -- front and back -- of every pack of cigarettes sold in the @entity16			1
last week , faced with arguments from the tobacco industry that the mandatory images violated free speech rights -- the cigarette companies said the images were " intended to elicit loathing , disgust and repulsion " -- the government backed down			2
attorney general @entity89 wrote that the government will not fight the case in the @entity92			2
the @entity11 will instead reevaluate the proposed labels			1
last week 's second event took place in @entity96 , where mayor @entity97 asked for a law that would force merchants to hide cigarettes on sale in their stores			1
" @entity103 " in a literal sense			0
the legislation would mandate that any cigarettes sold in a store would have to be concealed in a drawer , or in a cabinet , or behind a curtain -- it would be unlawful for the packs of cigarettes to be visible to anyone visiting the store			1
@entity97 's point is that the more difficult it is to purchase cigarettes , the fewer packs will be sold , and the healthier citizens will become			1
@entity97 : nanny - in - chief or health crusader ? @entity97 's proposal , and the case of the ghastly illustrations , both underline @entity16 's bizarrely bifurcated relationship with cigarettes : the country -- smokers and nonsmokers alike -- realizes the dangers involved			1
the @entity133 says that around 443,000 people a year die because of cigarette use			0
but the product is as legal as a loaf of bread or a jar of pickles			0
so the cigarette manufacturers have a point when they say the government is overstepping by demanding nauseating images on their packages			0
free speech does not only refer to our right to say anything we choose ; it also refers to our protection from having the government force us to say things against our will			0
even convicted killers , when speaking in court before sentencing , are not required to say they are guilty			0
the government has a right to create , publish and broadcast the strongest anti-smoking campaigns it can come up with , but the cigarette companies make a compelling case in saying that , as long as their product is legal , they should not be forced to print repellent images on their packages			0
( and -- who knows ? -- the federal government , in deciding not to fight the package illustrations battle in the @entity92 , may be wary of what could happen there			0
what if the @entity92 not only ruled against the proposed graphic illustrations -- but additionally , on similar grounds , opened up the question of whether the text - only warning messages on cigarette packs , the ones that have been there since the 1960s , also are an incursion on free speech ? ) in @entity96 , @entity97 's heart may be in the right place , but merchants who want to sell cigarettes should be justifiably puzzled : if any product is not legal , then they should be barred from stocking it , but as long as it is , how can anyone presume to tell them where to display it -- or , more to the point , that they ca n't display it ? it all comes down to this : while well - intentioned attempts to curb smoking may appear bold and decisive , they are in the end timid			1
the big and most effective step -- outlawing cigarettes on the grounds that they undeniably , in the long run , sicken and kill the people who smoke them , and those around them -- is not going to happen			2
politicians would be terrified to do it -- there are an estimated 45 million smokers in the @entity16 , and no one is going to risk alienating them by completely cutting them off from cigarettes			1
in an already shaky economy , the repercussions from shutting down the tobacco industry -- the jobs suddenly lost -- would be , to put it mildly , highly problematic from a political and real - world standpoint			0
the memory of @entity227 would undoubtedly be on lawmakers ' minds			0
the government once tried to take from people something they had been accustomed to , something that had been legal : alcohol			0
the outcome was anything but pretty			0
if there really were the political will to end cigarette use , there are ways			0
each state sets its own laws for the minimum age to purchase cigarettes -- in most states , it 's 18			2
if states decided to raise the age to , say , 80 , that would do it			0
but the chances are zero			0
like it or not , the country has painted itself into a corner			1
if they were a new product , they 'd never make it to market			0
do n't bet against them still being here a century from now .			0
