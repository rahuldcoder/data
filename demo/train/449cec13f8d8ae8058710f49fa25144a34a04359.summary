-- every friday , @entity1 dreaded her high school gym class			1
students had to run a mile under 11 minutes , and those who could n't finish in time would have to walk around the track for the rest of the period			2
weighing 234 pounds , @entity8 never made it in time			1
" there were a few times i tried to run because i was so embarrassed and afraid of what other kids might say			2
after many failed attempts , i gave up hope , " said @entity8			1
every day , @entity8 wore a baggy t - shirt and a pair of faded , size 18 jeans to school			1
she ducked and dodged anytime someone tried to take her picture			2

five years later and 112 pounds lighter , @entity8 is no longer the camera - shy girl hiding inside saggy , shapeless tees			1
she struts onstage in body - hugging evening gowns and swimsuits			2
she embraces the spotlight as the reigning miss @entity34			2
and she has been a guest co-host on " @entity36 , " chatting openly about her weight			2
@entity1 : applying weight - loss lessons to all of life " i had struggled for so many years with my weight , " @entity8 said			1
" so many girls look to beauty queens because they want to be like them and look like them			2
but my thing is that we 're all unique and we 're all different and not one person is going to look like the next			2
and somebody might be a healthy size 6 , and an unhealthy size 0			2
" when she makes public appearances , a tiara rests on her head and a sash drapes over her shoulder			2
she 'll compete for the @entity56 crown in january in @entity57			1
her journey from obese teenager to beauty queen is n't just about shedding excess weight , or going from one extreme to another			1

as a teen , @entity8 tried several weight - loss gimmicks , low - carb and starvation diets			1
but she 'd always slip back into her old habits because the hunger returned with such intensity			0
@entity8 's health battle is not rare in her home state			1
in @entity34 , about 31 % of the population is considered obese			0
" i figured that this was the body i was going to live in , and there was nothing i could do about it , " @entity8 said			1
" i was just so unhappy about the way i looked , but i still continued to eat unhealthy			0
" " i would come home from school , sit on the couch for hours , and snack all day long			0
i would drive to a fast food place , pick up any meal i wanted to , eat it and then go back an hour later , eat it again			2
" at age 17 , she went to the doctor 's office because of knee problems			0
the doctor did n't mince his words			0
" you know , this weight has to come off , " he told her			2
" and if it does n't , then your body is not going to take care of you in the long run			0
and you 're only 17 years old			0
" @entity8 realized that he was right			1
" i 'm 17 years old			0
i have the whole world in front of me			0
and it 's up to me and only me to change it			0
and that 's exactly what i did , " she said			0
surgery is no quick fix for obese teens she tossed out junk food and set a goal to lose five pounds in one month			1
and she put one foot in front of the other			0
she walked around the block because " that 's all i could do			0
" then the next week , she walked a little farther			0
after her first month , she lost seven pounds			1
when you 're losing weight , where does the fat go ? after losing more pounds , she joined the gym , started dancing in @entity167 classes			1
during her senior year of high school , an adviser at the pep club suggested @entity8 try for the title of @entity173 , the school 's equivalent of a beauty pageant			1
at first , @entity8 laughed it off			1
" i was not thin , " she said			0

@entity8 , who could n't finish a mile in under 11 minutes in high school , can now run that distance in seven minutes			1
she plans to train for her first marathon once she has time after the @entity56 contest			1
" you do n't have to be rail thin to think you 're beautiful and want to be @entity56 , " she said			1
" you need to be happy and content with yourself , get your physical activity			0
that 's what counts the most -- not starvation diets and being rail thin			0
" @entity8 meticulously schedules workouts and meals to prepare for @entity56			1
on a recent day , she cooked breakfast at home in @entity173 , scrambling eggs and slicing a grapefruit			0
" i block out where am i going to eat , how am i going to eat that day , " she said			0
in the pageant world , where a woman 's frame and figure are constantly analyzed , @entity8 has heard the critiques : too muscular , too big , not petite enough , not a size 00			1
@entity1 's @entity234 page " i love my body , " @entity8 said			1
" i went from 234 pounds to being comfortable and happy and being content with the way i look			2
someone says i 'm not a 00 -- that does n't mean i do n't continue to compete for @entity56			1
