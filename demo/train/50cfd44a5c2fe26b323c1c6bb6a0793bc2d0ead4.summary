" we are like one grain of sand against a whole beach			0
@entity6 has already climbed one mountain this summer in being admitted to @entity9 's top football tier , but its next task is even more daunting -- trying to compete in the same division as @entity14 champion @entity12			1
not only can real lavish a sum four times @entity18 's annual budget on just one player , its @entity16 stadium could hold the entire population of the tiny @entity23 town and still have 58,454 seats empty			1
@entity18 will be the smallest team ever to compete in @entity26 and had to raise $ 2.3 million in capital just to take its place at the top table of @entity9 football			1
its president @entity32 believes the greatest achievement in @entity18 's history would be to survive on such an uneven playing field			1
" there are several reasons why @entity12 and @entity41 are so far ahead in terms of finance , " @entity37 told @entity38			0
" both clubs have many connections around the world and do n't earn money by just selling tickets -- they have big merchandising campaign			0
" there 's also the huge television deals which they both have			2
it 's impossible to compete with them , not just for @entity18 which is the smallest team , but even for bigger clubs like @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
that @entity18 will go head - to - head with the likes of @entity62 and @entity41 l is something of a sporting miracle			1
after gaining promotion to @entity9 's second tier , the club promptly won the title for the first in its history			1
but a debut season rubbing shoulders with the likes of @entity41 , @entity12 and champions @entity76 was immediately under threat , due to a 1999 law passed down by the @entity9 authorities			1
it insists each team must have a capital equal to 25 % of the average expenses of all sides in the second division , excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest			2
the law is designed to ensure all clubs can attend to its debts , despite @entity26 's leading lights -- @entity12 and @entity41 -- being in the red to an estimated combined total close to € 1 billion ( $ 1.36 billion )			1
@entity18 , on the other hand , are self - sustaining and completely debt free ; even @entity26 's president has referred to them as a " model club			1
" and yet , failure to raise the required € 1.7 million ( $ 2.3 million ) would result in demotion back to the obscurity of @entity9 's third tier			1
but football loves an underdog and when @entity18 threw themselves at the mercy of fans by launching a share issue scheme , thousands stepped forward to help			1
the cash was raised a full three weeks before @entity18 's deadline , leaving @entity37 and others at the club dumbfounded at the pledges of support			1
" for a small city and a small club to receive such support from across the world is something that makes me very proud -- it feels like we 're part of a family , " said @entity37			0
" at the beginning there were some doubts we 'd raise the money , but later we realized we had a story to tell and that we could reach our target with hard work			0
" around 36 % of our shareholders are from @entity18 but because of the online marketing campaign we have shareholders from 50 different countries across the world			1
" we had people buying shares from the @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142			0
we had people coming to us from all over @entity144 and across the world			0
" it really has been incredible			0
" with the financial hurdles overcome , @entity18 's fans can now dream of the footballing treats that lie ahead			1
@entity41 and @entity12 will visit @entity18 's titchy @entity151 stadium ( capacity 5,900 ) in due course , but first up are neighbors @entity155 for a @entity23 derby on sunday			1
" this club was founded in 1940 after the troubles of the @entity160 , " added @entity37 , referring to the conflict that tore @entity9 apart			1
" this is the first time in 74 years and this is a dream			0
now we have to maintain the dream in @entity26			1
we 're sure that we 're going to be competitive and fight until the last minute of the season to avoid relegation			0
" this club is used to facing challenges			0
" @entity4 has been a supporters of @entity18 all his life and is in no doubt the last year qualifies as a bona fide sporting miracle			1
" you ca n't even compare @entity18 with @entity41 or @entity12 , " said @entity173			2
" the population of @entity18 is 27,000 people , against @entity12 in a city of more than 3.5 million people			2
" everyone is bigger in terms of budget , population , stadium , players but our story is going to be a good one for football as a whole			2
" it will be tough on the pitch but i 'm really confident because we have no pressure on us			0
this year is a like a present to all the supporters of @entity18			2
" nobody 's going to whistle or shout against the team or the players			0
we are @entity18 -- we know who we are			2
" like @entity37 , @entity173 believes @entity9 football needs to redistribute its wealth better			2
though @entity18 raised the cash it needed to lift its head above the financial bar imposed by the league , it 's still dwarfed by almost all its fellow @entity26 clubs			1
@entity18 's budget for the season is around the same as @entity41 star @entity212 will earn in wages over the same period			1
that 's partly because @entity9 clubs are allowed to sell its television rights independently , meaning the likes of @entity12 and @entity41 could command four times the amount that @entity18 can muster			1
" it is not fair at all , " @entity173 said			0
" not only in how the tv money is shared among the teams but also the huge amount of money some clubs owe			0
@entity18 has no debt at all			2
" these guys are free to buy a lot of players with the money they get from tv and it makes for a paralyzed league where the top two or three teams have 80 % of the resources and the rest have peanuts			0
" in @entity9 it is a nonsense to say someone outside of @entity12 , @entity76 or @entity41 will win the league			2
there is no fourth candidate			0
" @entity18 is n't concerned with the title race though -- its battle is to finish fourth from bottom and avoid relegation			2
@entity173 is convinced they can do it , if they harness the intimidating surrounds of @entity250 , and call on the famed togetherness in the town			0
" the spirit is the most important thing that will help us overcome all the challenges we will have this year , " he said			0
" we have overcome a lot of crises in the town and reinvented ourselves			0
we now have to adapt to what is coming this year			0
" we 're going to have the lowest budget with no big names in our team but we will make it with the players and all of us pushing in the same direction -- this is in our spirit			0
