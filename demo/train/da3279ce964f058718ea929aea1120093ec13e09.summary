it 's @entity2 's graduation day , but all she can think about is @entity4 , the powerful billionaire who wants to make her his sexual submissive			1
as he sits onstage , preparing to deliver a commencement speech , " @entity8 stands out in his bespoke suit , copper highlights glinting in his hair under the auditorium lights			0
he looks so serious and self - contained , " she thinks to herself			0
" @entity2 , " as she 's known in @entity24 ' erotic bestselling novel , watches @entity4 unbutton his single - breasted jacket , revealing the silk tie he used to bind her wrists to her headboard a few nights prior , and nearly loses it			1
hot and bothered as she might be in her cap and gown , @entity2 does well to note that @entity4 , the title character from " @entity4 , " would never be caught dead in an off - the - rack suit			1
if clothes make the man , " this guy would n't have a brand , " costume designer @entity31 said recently			0
instead , @entity31 commissioned @entity37 bespoke tailor @entity36 to build custom suits for actor @entity39 , who plays the successful ceo of @entity41 with a sexual appetite for bondage and discipline in the film adaptation of the book , opening friday			1
@entity36 's job was to translate @entity31 ' vision into suits befitting a young tycoon whose controlling demeanor imbues every aspect of his character			1
@entity36 knows the character well			2
@entity4 may be a fantasy , but he embodies the latest generation of men embracing the impeccably tailored suit as a status symbol			1
bespoke tailoring tends to appeal to the @entity4 type : a " control freak , " in @entity2 's words , who enjoys making personalized style choices with the help of a master tailor , creating a one - of - a - kind suit			1
as a costume designer , " you 're helping to tell story of the character , visually , " said @entity70 costume designer @entity69 , who recommended @entity36 to @entity31 for the " @entity4 " gig			1
" you 're seeing the whole character come to life through their costume , " she said			0
modern yet timeless @entity36 knew little about the character or the production going into the job ; even the film 's title was kept secret before he met @entity39 for the first time in november 2013			1
@entity31 showed @entity36 a @entity88 suit ad from a fashion magazine , and @entity36 instantly understood the look : subtle , dark and elegant with a fitted , slim cut to show off @entity4 's sculpted physique , @entity36 said			1
" no bold patterns , big shoulders or wide lapels			0
just a very minimalist approach with a rich , dark , conservative color palette and timeless design , " @entity36 said			2
behind the covered windows of @entity36 's @entity101 workshop , @entity39 tried on seven suits made from lightweight @entity104 wool in five shades of gray , one brown , one @entity109 blue			1
the evolving color palette reflects @entity4 's softening attitude toward his young lover , @entity31 told elle			1
while @entity36 went to work on the suits , @entity39 worked with a trainer in @entity117 to physically prepare for the role of @entity4 , whose fitness obsession is another manifestation of his domineering character			1
by the time they met again four weeks later , @entity39 's wiry frame had filled out , and things started to get tight , especially in the arms , @entity36 said			1
" the look they were going for was very lean and tight , so it basically worked , " @entity36 said			2
a tailor on location in @entity117 finished the seven suits , each of which bears characteristics of bespoke tailoring , a classic @entity130 style of suiting : a two - button , single - breasted , form - fitting coat with a 3 - inch peak lapel , slanted lower flap pockets and side vents in back			2
the sleeves of the jacket are slim and tapered with working sleeve buttonholes , with about an inch of @entity109 cuff showing below the end of the sleeve , @entity36 said			2
" the armholes were quite high , and the jacket was nipped in at the waist to give suppression , which makes the shoulder and chest line appear powerful , yet natural			0
the jacket length was short , just long enough to cover his bum , " he said			0
the pants were skinny - legged , slim cuts with a low rise and tapered bottoms -- no cuffs , just a plain bottom with a touch of a break , he said			0
" in short , the cut was modern yet timeless , elegant and quite conservative			0
" an era of personalization @entity36 was a natural choice to dress the stylish billionaire			2
he has been making suits inspired by @entity175 for nearly 30 years			1
well - heeled clients visit @entity36 's showroom for the customary four - step process of building a bespoke suit			1
@entity36 's path to bespoke tailoring began in his teens with a visit to high - end haberdasheries in @entity186 's @entity185			1
a light went off , and he vowed to one day own a store full of his own creations			0
at age 18 , he commissioned his first bespoke suit and fell in love with the process			0
he undertook an apprenticeship with the @entity196 - trained tailor who made his suit to learn the art of bespoke tailoring			2
@entity36 broke into @entity70 costume design thanks to @entity201 , who hired him to build suits and coats for " @entity204 " @entity205 and @entity206 : power players like @entity4 who wear their control over others on their sleeves			1
inspired in part by the sartorial elegance of " @entity204 , " the custom , tailored suit has been making a comeback in recent years on the red carpet and in the pages of fashion magazines			2
classic suiting coincides with an era of personalization in which consumers can become " co-creators " of their own style , said @entity225 , director of strategic business development for the @entity227 , a fashion trend marketing group			0
" there is a newfound appreciation of tailored clothing among millennials that brings in their point of view , " he said			0
" especially for a guy who loves the technical aspect of how things are made , the more you engage them in the process , the more they like it , and they do it again			0
" @entity36 knows the type well : a man with a " fanatical " interest in his personal style who has the means to step up his game through custom or bespoke suiting			0
the difference between the two is often reflected in the price tag			0
in bespoke suiting , which typically starts in the four - figure range , a master tailor creates a unique pattern based on the client 's preferences			0
custom - made suits , which tend to start in the triple digits , are tailored to fit your body from an existing pattern			0
what 's the appeal ? the ability to steer the outcome , @entity36 said -- a characteristic that fans of the trilogy will immediately identify with @entity4 in his pursuit of naive @entity2			1
" once a client has experience choosing their own fabric , lining and buttons and goes through the process of the basted fittings and the delivery of the finished product , they never go back to the ready - to - wear world , " @entity36 said			2
" the reason is control			0
" ' @entity4 ' : what the critics say			0
