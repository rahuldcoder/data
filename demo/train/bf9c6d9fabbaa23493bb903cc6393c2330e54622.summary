-- while millions may be running to the malls this holiday season , there are some people running away from the buying frenzy			1
several online movements have inspired thousands of people to attempt to spend little or no cash on holiday presents			1
followers are avoiding shopping malls and opting to save their money , make their own presents or provide free services like baby - sitting or massages as gifts			1
" the holiday season is about sharing time with loved ones , not going into debt , " said @entity17 , a @entity18 " @entity19 " follower			1
" it is entirely unnecessary to spend money in order to show others that you care			0
" in addition to the @entity18 page that @entity17 and some 1,700 people follow , websites called buynothingchristmas , buynothingday and revbilly are encouraging people to stop spending a lot of cash on gifts and reduce holiday consumerism			1
@entity40 co-founded buynothingchristmas.org and said during the holidays , his site attracts up to 7,000 hits a day from people wanting to learn more about the movement			1
" our website challenges people to de-commercialize @entity19 and connect in simpler ways , such as spending time with friends and loved ones and giving to less - privileged people , " said @entity40			1
@entity52 of @entity53 , @entity54 , is among those who asked his family to attend a holiday event together instead of exchanging gifts last year			1
" it felt wonderful to create some special memories with people we love and we plan to do it again this year , " said @entity52			2
it 's not just anti-consumerism fueling the cause			2
" @entity19 is an environmentalist 's worst nightmare -- tons of extra landfill , megawatts of flashing lights and congested shopping mall parking lots , " said @entity67 , an anti-consumer subscriber			1
while followers of the movement find various ways to support the cause , @entity72 , a spokesperson with the @entity73 , has a different take			1
@entity72 said he respects a person 's right to celebrate the holidays as he or she chooses and does not want to make it a " we " versus " them " issue			0
" however , the retail sector helps generate one in five @entity89 jobs and it is important to remember how critical this industry is to our weakened economy and to help support it , " @entity72 said			1
" some 95 % of retailers are small , independent businesses			2
" " some 500,000 retail positions will be created this holiday season in the @entity89 and these jobs play a huge role in fueling our economy			1
" but for some people , like @entity17 , supporting the @entity89 retail sector is not an easy option			2
her family was forced to change spending habits a couple of years ago			0
" after my husband lost his job in january of 2008 he was unemployed for almost two years before he found part - time work , " said @entity17			0
" i had my own business , which became our primary income			0
unemployment benefits did n't cover much -- we did n't have a choice but to be hyper - responsible with money			0
" the anti-consumerism philosophy has kept the @entity118 afloat financially			2
@entity17 said they do n't have to worry about credit card bills and she does not argue with her husband about money			0
" i know some people are willing to run up the charge cards and spend tons of cash on the latest toys and games for children , " @entity17 said			2
" i can get ' new - to - my - kids ' toys and give an even more important gift -- a family that is financially stable even in a failing economy			0
" @entity17 said making gifts for the holidays and finding free or used items is easier than many might imagine			0
" look at your talents and ask yourself -- can you cook or sew or do you have a special hobby to share ? is there something you can teach or could you clean someone 's house ? " as a former massage therapist , she has used her skills to give free gift certificates			0
she also knits and gives away food she has grown , canned and baked			0
@entity17 ' husband , @entity151 , is a beekeeper and gives away honey , beeswax candles or honey wine ( also known as mead )			0
" i 've found people are far more impressed with the time and effort that went into a handmade gift than the perceived dollar amount spent on a retail gift			0
