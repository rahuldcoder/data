-- some foods sold in supermarkets across @entity4 contain tiny , engineered particles called nanomaterials			1
our organization decided to test doughnuts after learning that the titanium dioxide used as a coloring in the powdered sugar coating likely contained nano - sized particles			2
the tests , conducted by an independent laboratory , found that both @entity15 and @entity16 did indeed contain titanium dioxide nanoparticles			2
in response , a spokeswoman for @entity19 said the company was looking into the matter			0
you must be wondering : what are nanomaterials ? they are microscopic in size			2
" if a nanoparticle were the size of a football , a red blood cell would be the size of the field			0
" nanoparticles have been heralded as having the potential to revolutionize the food industry -- from enabling the production of creamy liquids that contain no fat , to enhancing flavors , improving supplement delivery , providing brighter colors , keeping food fresh longer , or indicating when it spoils			2
but there are a few problems			0
one is that no one knows how many and which food products have them			0
companies are not being forthcoming about whether they are using nanoparticles			1
to further complicate the issue , some companies may not even be aware that they are selling products containing them			2
many companies are reluctant or uninterested in discussing the issue , and concrete information has been difficult to obtain			2
the majority of food companies are not responsive in providing information about their specific uses , plans and policies toward nanoparticles			1
there is also no law in the @entity4 that requires disclosure			0
in contrast , companies in the @entity69 are required to label foods containing nanoparticles			1
the bigger issue with nanoparticles is that they might pose health risks , as they have been found to in tests on mice			1
there are not nearly enough studies that can adequately demonstrate the safety of nanoparticles in food additives or packaging			1
scientists are still investigating how the broad range of nanoparticles , with their myriad potential uses , would react in the body			0
when ingested , nano - sized particles can pass into the blood and lymph , where they circulate through the body and reach in potentially sensitive sites such as bone marrow , lymph nodes , the spleen , the brain , the liver and the heart			0
our knowledge about how nanomaterial food additives react in the body and their health impact is still in its infancy			0
while efforts are under way to understand them better , much deeper scientific inquiry should occur before nanoparticles are sold in food and food - related products			0
more companies and consumers need to be aware of the use of engineered nanomaterials in foods and the potential unknown risks of this technology			1
more food products like @entity124 's and @entity125 should be tested as recent studies have identified them as likely to contain nanomaterials as well			1
fortunately , a few companies have become willing to take a public position on nanoparticles			1
@entity130 stated that it " does not currently support the use by suppliers of nano - engineered materials in the production of any of our food , packaging , and toys			0
" similarly , @entity139 said that it was not using nanotechnology			0
some of the largest food companies in the world , including @entity143 ! brands , @entity145 , and @entity146 , need to know more about nanomaterials and check with their supplies to see if they are using them			1
@entity4 are becoming increasingly interested in what is in the food they 're eating			0
no longer content with label information on daily allowances of vitamins and minerals , @entity4 consumers are following the lead of their counterparts in many other countries by demanding more disclosure about where and how their food is grown and whether it is safe			0
even though communicating risks to consumers can be challenging , the public 's perception of safety will be paramount in determining the acceptance of nanomaterials			1
this is especially true for an emerging food - products technology the safety of which even the @entity175 has acknowledged a lack of understanding			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : some foods contain tiny , engineered particles called nanomaterials
@entity182 : nanoparticles might pose health risks , since they have *adversely* affected mice
he says not enough studies have adequately demonstrated the safety of nanoparticles
@entity182 : with an emerging technology such as this , companies have to be *careful*
