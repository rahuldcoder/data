-- a group of african - american church leaders announced wednesday their intention to join ranks with the @entity5 in the nation 's capital , bolstering what some consider a mutual message of condemning income inequality and social injustice			1
the move comes against the backdrop of evictions of occupy protesters encamped in city parks and squares across the @entity19 , raising questions about whether the two groups can capitalize on momentum gained by the months - long movement			1
" we are occupying until poverty is eradicated , " pastor @entity24 told reporters at the @entity26 in @entity27 , near where a core group of activists remains encamped			1
the two groups plan to gather during a national " day of action " scheduled for january 16 , set to coincide with the commemoration of former civil rights leader @entity34 but could wednesday 's announcement signify that @entity5 is now shifting toward more established forms of influence ? " every successful movement begins with a grievance and turns into an agenda , " said @entity38 , a senior fellow at the @entity27 - based @entity39			1
by linking up with black church leaders , he said , the group can tap into a community with years of experience in social movements			1
since september , activists have gathered to draw attention to corporate greed and the excesses of the so - called 1 % , a reference to the nation 's elite , who protesters say wield disproportionate influence over the rest of the country			1
their message , though popular , has also been criticized for its lack of focus			2
but on wednesday , church leaders outlined a more specific call to lawmakers , asking for a moratorium on foreclosures , an increase in federal pell grants to students and added national funding for job training			1
in past months demonstrators have largely shunned established political figures , wary of being co-opted by outside influence			2
and yet outside groups have largely been involved , swelling demonstrator marches with union ranks in cities like @entity80 , where activists first encamped in a lower @entity83 park			1
" when they had physical spaces , then the point was to be there , " added @entity38 of the encampments			2
" but the movement has to move from occupation to something else			2
" last month , authorities in @entity80 , @entity93 and @entity94 dismantled tents and arrested protesters who refused to leave city parks and squares			2
on saturday , police arrested 46 people in @entity102 , sweeping through a downtown square to evict people rooted there since late september			0
" i think there is a danger " the movement could lose momentum without these physical spaces , said @entity106 , a @entity39 fellow in governance studies			0
" but i 'm not sure that it 's a foregone conclusion			0
" there 's a pretty lively web space for this community			0
" but whether the movement can evolve into an " @entity5 " could be key to its survival as a relevant social movement in the months and years ahead			1
that evolution may also require adopting more institutional forms of influence , such as lobbying and use of the courts , which protesters have often labeled corrupt			0
" people might be a little frustrated that the movement is taking a new shape , " @entity106 said			0
but with the loss of landmark encampments in places like @entity83 's @entity133 and @entity102 's @entity134 , " i 'm not sure what they 're actually trying to accomplish if they do n't adapt			0
" the group 's @entity140 feed , meanwhile , remained abuzz with online activity on wednesday			1
" how do we take back our govt from corrupt and incompetent elected officials ? " read one post			0
" keep the dream alive , " read another			0
