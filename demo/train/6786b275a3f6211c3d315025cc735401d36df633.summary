-- ever wonder what goes into the making of that round , black , rubber thing that holds air , we refer to as a tire ? to the casual observer all tires look the same , but there 's a lot more to it than meets the eye ... there are many different tire designs and they may contain up to 200 raw materials			1
modern tire construction has allowed for a degree of handling , ride comfort , traction , extended treadwear and fuel economy that far exceeds the tires of just a few years ago			1
today there are tire designs that contain up to 200 raw materials , as well as complex architecture of steel belts , textile piles and computer designed tread patterns , which deliver maximum traction under all conditions			1
each component of a tire is designed to perform its own function and to work together with the rest of the components			1
for instance , the belt system 's job is to provide stability to the tread area , keep the tread grooves open , and work as a unit with the sidewalls to provide stability in cornering and handling			1
kind of reminds me of the old song , " the toe bone 's connected to the foot bone " well ... you get the picture , right ? the major component in tires is rubber			1
how did this substance find its way into the @entity61 automobile tire ? as with most inventions , this is a fascinating story			1
rubber by itself is a gooey substance that is extremely sensitive to temperature			1
back in the early 1830 's " rubber fever " was the craze , and it ended as quickly as it started			1
at first , everybody wanted things made of this new waterproof gum from @entity72 , and factories sprung up to meet the demand			1
then abruptly , the public became fed up with the messy stuff that froze bone - hard in winter and turned glue - like in summer			0
not one of the young rubber companies survived as long as five years			2
investors lost millions and everyone agreed that rubber had seen its hay - day in @entity61			2
@entity83 autos : best car deals of the month then @entity85 stepped up to the plate			1
through extensive experimentation and persistence , @entity87 found that rubber could be stabilized and formed into a useful compound by adding sulfur and applying heat			2
he found that steam under pressure , applied to the compound for 4 to 6 hours at about 270 degrees @entity98 , gave him the most uniform results			0
this was the beginning of rubber compounds ! @entity83 autos : most popular sedans rubber compounding is like mixing a cake			1
different ingredients are mixed together at different degrees to produce rubber with specific characteristics			2
some rubber compounds are stickier for better traction when racing			1
some compounds are much harder for heavy - duty work in construction or with heavy equipment			2
all - season rubber for all - season tires is rubber that does n't freeze below thirty - two degrees , allowing for movement of the tread in the cold weather so it will grip and give maximum traction in all weather			1
@entity83 autos : best - selling hybrid cars ever wonder how a steel belted radial tire is constructed ? check this out			1
first comes the construction of the casing			0
this is the body ( or carcass ) of the tire ... the " foundation " upon which everything is built			2
the casing is made up of a series of cords ( most typically polyester ) which are combined to form layers or piles			1
these layers are connected to two circular strands of steel called beads			2
then the inner liner is added , serving as the air seal			0
once the casing is formed , everything else is added to make up the tire			2

next comes the steel belt			0
this is a belt made up of woven steel strands that cover the casing of the tire and is located directly under the tread			1
the steel belt adds strength and durability , aids in keeping the tread grooves open for maximum traction , and protects the casing against impacts and punctures			1
on high performance tires an extra belt is usually added for strength ; this is a nylon overlay that is wrapped around the whole steel belt package			2
as the tire rolls faster it heats up			2
the nylon in turn heats up and tends to shrink , counteracting the natural tendency of centrifugal force to throw the whole thing apart at high speeds			0

finally , the tread is added			2
remember that this rubber compound is a special mix for a specific application and varies depending on the function of the tire			1
in this day and age , computers play a big role in the tread designs			1
tread designs are tested for traction in " virtual reality " before they are molded into the rubber			1
while tread designs vary greatly , there are consistent elements present in all tread patterns			1
the tread block grips at its leading and trailing edge			2
within each block , sipes are often molded or cut to provide additional traction			2
these sipes segment the block and allow for movement of each individual block so that when it comes in contact with the pavement , it opens and closes causing a squeegee ( or pumping ) action , cleaning the road surface as it rolls along			0
the grooves built into the tread pattern are designed to channel away weather elements such as water , snow , slush , and mud			0
to illustrate how a tread design channels away water , just pour water over the tread of the tire and watch the water directed right out of the sides of the tire			1
on the outside edges of the tires " shoulder lugs " are molded into the tread			1
these heavy segments provide protection as well as additional traction during hard cornering			0
a final note and credit to @entity85			1
he did n't just happen upon this discovery of rubber compounding and the use of heat			0
@entity87 spent five miserable years in poverty trying to perfect his idea			0
then one day , it happened ... the great discovery came in the winter of 1839			0
as stated earlier , @entity87 was using sulfur in his experiments			0
although @entity87 himself has left the details in doubt , the most persistent story goes as follows			0
one february day , @entity87 wandered into @entity258 's general store to show off his latest gum - and - sulfur formula			0
snickers rose from the cracker - barrel forum , and the usually mild - mannered little inventor got excited and waved his sticky fistful of gum in the air			0
it flew from his fingers and landed on the sizzling - hot potbellied stove			0
when he bent to scrape it off , he found that instead of melting like molasses , it had charred like leather			0
and around the charred area was a dry , springy brown rim -- " gum elastic " still , but so remarkably altered that it was virtually a new substance			0
he had made weatherproof rubber ! this discovery is often cited as one of history 's most celebrated " accidents			1
" @entity87 stoutly denied that			0
like @entity287 's falling apple , he maintained , the hot stove incident held meaning only for the man " whose mind was prepared to draw an inference			0
" that meant , he added simply , the one who had " applied himself most perseveringly to the subject			0
" thanks for your perseverance @entity300			0
