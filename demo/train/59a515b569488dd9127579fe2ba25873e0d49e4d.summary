-- during the first presidential debate wednesday night , the candidates talked a lot about how they would lower the cost of your medical care			2
heavy on data and large numbers , the debate may not have been the easiest to follow for @entity10 interested in the subject			0
@entity12 , an @entity13 economist who specializes in health care costs , may have been one of the few excited by all these numbers			1
" it was about as substantive a debate as i think we 've ever seen , " @entity12 said			0
" the problem is , even after this debate , i do n't think people truly understand the similarities and the differences in what these candidates are proposing for health care			1
" fact check : would repeal of @entity26 hike seniors ' drug costs ? here are five things you should know about what the candidates said about health care in last night 's debate : 1			1
you do pay more for health insurance , but @entity37 's policy is n't totally to blame			2
the first mention of health care came about six minutes into the debate			1
discussing how " middle - income americans have been buried " financially under the president 's policies , @entity42 challenger @entity41 said health care costs have gone up by $ 2,500 a family			1
each year , health care costs have gone up during @entity37 's administration -- that is true			1
but experts say the increases have not been due to policy , but because of the rising cost of health care			1
the figure romney used is not quite right			0
the @entity57 , which conducts an annual survey of health care costs , found that since 2008 the average family premium has gone up about $ 1,698			1
for context , that is the total cost that you and your employer pay -- it 's not $ 1,698 out of your pocket			2
in fact , the report said the increase you personally pay was not " statistically significant			0
" rising health care costs are a significant problem , though			1
the same survey found that the average premiums for family coverage have increased a whopping 113 % since 2001			1
that means the trend started long before president @entity37 took office			0
@entity41 takes debate to @entity37 over economy , health care 2			1
@entity81 and @entity83 fraud is a huge problem and more needs to be done			1
@entity37 's first specific reference to health care described how the administration pursued medical fraud in @entity83 " more aggressively than ever before , " which saved the system tens of billions of dollars			1
@entity83 and @entity81 fraud is what one expert called " one of the most profitable crimes in @entity10			1
" it costs taxpayers billions of dollars annually -- $ 60 to $ 90 billion a year , based on government estimates			1
that 's money that could be better spent on taking care of actual health care costs			1
fact check : would @entity41 bankrupt @entity83 by 2016 ? historically , it was up to states to police this problem , but the fraud grew too big for them to handle			1
a @entity42 - backed bill called the @entity108 created the @entity109 , which gives the federal government the ability to oversee and support states ' anti-fraud efforts			0
the @entity37 administration launched several key programs to protect against fraud			2
they have saved taxpayers billions ; however , a @entity120 investigation concluded that while progress has been made under @entity37 , more could be done			0
in a report this june , in fact , it found at least one of the major programs -- an audit conducted by the government -- costs taxpayers $ 102 million , but only found $ 20 million in excess payments			2
" they have certainly been increasing their work in this area , " @entity12 said			0
" a certain kind of focus definitely did help eliminate some of this fraud			2
" health care act 's glaring omission : liability reform 3			1
sending @entity81 back to the states would save the federal government money , but cost states more and adversely impact those using the benefits			0
@entity37 criticized @entity41 's idea of sending @entity81 back to the states			0
he argued that this would mean a " 30 % cut in the primary program ( for ) seniors who are in nursing homes , for kids who are with disabilities			2
" the plan @entity42 vice-presidential candidate @entity157 , as the head of the @entity155 , suggested in april -- which @entity41 adopted as his own -- would cut $ 1.4 trillion in @entity81 in the next 10 years			2
it would accomplish this by converting the program into a block grant that would in large part shift costs to the states , which @entity41 argued would give states more flexibility to do what they deem best to help their @entity81 population			0
the nonpartisan @entity169 conducted an analysis of the proposal , which found that it would save the federal government a significant amount			0
medicaid costs would be 49 % lower by 2030 than current spending under @entity157 's plan			1
that 's because the block grant spending caps the cost and makes fewer adjustments			0
the @entity169 concluded that while the federal government would save money , the states would " face significant challenges in achieving sufficient cost savings			0
" in wednesday night 's debate , @entity41 spelled out how he would adjust spending behind these block grants			0
" i would like to take the medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state , ' you 're going to get what you got last year , plus inflation , plus 1 % , and then you 're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best , ' " he said			1
that formula does n't account for rising health care costs ( remember the cost of health insurance has gone up 113 % since 2001 ) , nor does it account for the aging population			1
with " baby boomers " getting older , there will be 63 million more people over 60 by the time 2030 comes around , according to @entity10 @entity206 projections			0
health care costs would go up significantly to accommodate this 20 % increase in the number of people over 60 who will need more health care			1
nor does @entity41 's formula account for economic downturns where more people would qualify for the @entity81 program , like the current government formula -- which would leave the states in a much more uncertain position			0
the @entity169 analysis concludes about these block grants that these proposed cuts would " likely force states to scale back their medicaid programs considerably			2
" since poor people , seniors , and people with disabilities make up the majority of those who receive @entity81 , " they 'd be hit the hardest			0
" new report compares @entity37 , @entity41 health care plans 4			1
@entity41 's accusation that @entity37 cut @entity83 by $ 716 billion is misleading			1
in the debate , @entity41 said 10 times that @entity37 was paying for his health care package by taking the money from @entity83 recipients ' pockets , cutting $ 716 billion out of the program			1
" to balance the additional cost of @entity26 is , in my opinion , a mistake , " @entity41 said			0
in his closing statement , he promised to restore that amount			0
dozens of bipartisan fact - checkers say that number , often repeated by the @entity41 / @entity157 campaign , is misleading			2
where does it come from ? it 's the figure mentioned in a letter from the @entity169 sent to house speaker @entity254 in july			0
@entity254 had asked for an analysis from the @entity169 if @entity256 could repeal @entity26 , something @entity41 said he would do if elected			0
" spending for @entity83 would increase by an estimated $ 716 billion " over the next decade , the analysis said			1
that means @entity83 would cost the government more			2
@entity37 's health legislation does not mean people will see cuts to their benefits			2
hospitals and health care providers will , but that 's what they agreed to in exchange for the @entity26 's mandate that people have health insurance			1
if more people have health insurance , hospitals will have to care for fewer of the uninsured			2
uninsured patients cost significantly more to care for than patients who are insured			2
it is unclear what impact the cuts would have on the @entity83 program			1
@entity41 argues providers will accept fewer @entity81 patients			0
in the debate he said , " some 15 % of hospitals and nursing homes say they wo n't take any more @entity83 patients under that scenario ( @entity26 )			1
" @entity83 's own independent actuary , which it uses to analyze changes in the program , has warned that these planned cuts to pay providers ' bills will force some doctors to stop accepting @entity83 patients			1
the @entity300 and @entity299 do it better			0
the candidates agreed during the debate that more needs to be done to control the cost of health care			1
@entity37 praised the @entity306 as a model for new ways of controlling the cost of care			1
" they actually provide great care cheaper than average , " he said			2
" and the reason they do is because they do some smart things			0
" one approach he highlighted was the collaborative approach of the clinic 's doctors			0
instead of each doctor ordering a different test , they meet and decide as a team how to approach the patient 's problem			0
the team of doctors also provides preventive care			0
@entity37 has held the clinic up as a model throughout his time in office			2
he visited it in 2009			0
it is a top - ranked teaching hospital that attracts patients from around the world			0
an analysis done by the @entity340 found that the @entity306 did treat @entity83 patients for tens of thousands of dollars less than many other medical centers			1
one of the big differences between the @entity306 and other hospitals is that it and other multi-specialty clinics like the @entity347 in @entity348 employ their own doctors and can create these teams			2
in most traditional hospitals , doctors are independent private practitioners who are left to making their own choices			0
@entity306 's success secret because @entity306 's doctors are paid fixed salaries , there is less incentive to do unnecessary tests or procedures compared to a doctor who works on a fee - for - service basis			1
as of right now , @entity83 acts a lot like those traditional hospitals do , @entity12 said			2
" if you take the typical patient who is chronically ill , they will be overweight or obese , they suffer from bad cholesterol , hypertension , asthma and diabetes -- that means they take 10 to 15 medications and there is no team - based care , " he said			0
" going to separate doctors with their own plans is expensive			0
these integrated group plans work well and the ongoing preventive care they provide -- working with doctors , nutritionists , nurses , nurse practitioners and the rest -- ultimately save on costs			0
" complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity390			0

a survey finds average health care premiums for families are up 113 % since 2001
@entity83 and medicaid fraud remains a huge problem
an accusation of $ 716 billion in @entity83 cuts is misleading
the @entity306 is held up as a success model
