-- " @entity1 is not on the @entity2 , it 's basically an intranet			1
everything is banned by the @entity8 , " says @entity5 , co-author of " @entity6 : @entity1 's @entity9			0
" @entity5 , author of " @entity6 , " talks about @entity1 's online habits and internet culture			1
with 338 million internet users in june 2009 , according to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , @entity1 is no longer a niche market of the online industry			1
@entity1 is the second most common language on the @entity2 , according to @entity18 , and quickly gaining ground on @entity20			0
as the former technology writer for @entity23 's daily @entity20 - language newspaper , @entity22 , @entity5 has been following closely @entity1 's exponential internet developments over the past decade			1
what inspired her to write " @entity6 " was the chasm in online culture on either side of @entity1 's carefully controlled borders			1
" the information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know @entity1 and those who are from another part of world and who do n't is just so huge , " observes so			1
" i 've talked to lots of investors , analysts , visitors to @entity23 , and they really do n't know what 's happening in @entity1			0
they ask the silliest questions about @entity1 and the @entity2			0
" " @entity6 " tells the stories behind @entity1 's homegrown online start - ups , often overtaking dominant start - ups that have been successful in the @entity51 but which flailed after venturing into @entity1 territory			1
one anecdote involves an advertisement by @entity55 , @entity1 's most popular search engine , teasing @entity57 for not knowing @entity1			1
@entity57 focused on high - end technology rather than @entity1 linguistics			1
from 2002 to 2005 , @entity57 's @entity1 site also suffered interference from the @entity1 government , which redirected users to @entity55 whenever @entity57 's search results failed to comply with @entity1 's censorship rules			1
although @entity57 has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order , it still trails @entity55 with only 28 percent of the search - engine market share , compared to @entity55 's 63 percent , according to a 2008 study by @entity71			1
conquering the internet with @entity1 characteristics so what are the unique characteristics of @entity1 's netizens ? while 25.5 percent of the @entity1 population is now online , @entity14 's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them : 67 percent are below the age of 30 ; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower ; 33 percent are students ; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $ 75 per month			1
moreover , 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an internet cafe			0
once connected , 84 percent listen to music , 75 percent instant - message , 63 percent play online games , and only 57 percent e-mail			0
in short , for the vast majority of @entity1 , @entity2 means play , not work			1
one could conclude that an internet entrepreneur 's target audience in @entity1 is teenage and twenty - something students , low - end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill			1
among the most salient of @entity1 's @entity2 start - ups are those that innovated on proven @entity108 models by successfully adapting them to the @entity1 market			1
@entity111 , with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide , is one of the start - ups that gets it			0
@entity111 is now the largest internet company in @entity1			2
" what really made [ @entity111 founder ] @entity117 stand out is that he viewed his @entity121 instant messenger differently from other @entity123 services such as @entity124 and @entity125 , " says so			0
" they viewed @entity123 as a two - way communication , so made it as efficient as possible			0
they targeted the high - end white - collar users , thinking they 're rich , advertisers will love them , they 'll buy additional services			1
@entity121 was a community targeting low - end users -- kids , factory workers			1
they do n't need efficiency , they come online to kill time , to be entertained , to talk with friends , not to do work			0
" in a @entity1 where economic growth comes at different speeds , @entity5 believes that the @entity2 has leveled out the playing field			0
" the online population in @entity1 comes from very modest families , " she says			2
" forty percent go online at internet cafes , which is the cheapest entertainment alternative you can find			2
it costs just 30 cents per hour			0
the poorest kid can afford that , and these internet cafes can be found in the most remote regions			0
" so actually the @entity2 is flattening out this information gap , if not material gap , because even the poorest kid in @entity1 can go online and get information			2
and because of piracy , they can also download lots of stuff for free			0
" sea turtle power another recurring factor of success among @entity1 internet start - ups is their founders ' extensive experience working in @entity169 before returning to @entity1 to launch their own business			1
a person who has returned to @entity1 from overseas is known in @entity172 as " hai gui , " which sounds the same as the @entity172 words for " sea turtle			2
" such entrepreneurial returnees include @entity55 's @entity178 , @entity180 's @entity179 and @entity182 's @entity181			0
" @entity183 bring in new ideas , " says so			0
" like what is a search engine ? " " @entity178 was an engineer with a patent on search mechanism , and he wanted to build a @entity1 search engine			2
he brought in the idea , the technology and the funding			0
while he was still working for @entity192 in @entity169 , he got $ 1.2 million from former executives of @entity194			2
then he went back to @entity1 and recruited students and teachers from @entity197 , and he built @entity55 in a year			2
" finally [ the sea turtle @entity198 ] go to the @entity200 for ipo listing , because that is where the market really understands the @entity2 and can appreciate what they did			0
" likewise , @entity1 is growing from both foreign interaction and the new technological and political challenges of online culture and commerce			2
as the " @entity210 " continues to expand and evolve , @entity1 continues to explore the fragile balance between censorship and control , and enterprise and innovation .			0

@entity1 counts 338 million internet users , but only 25.5 percent of its population
majority of @entity1 netizens are low - end users in search of entertainment
internet in @entity1 has made information and popular culture *accessible* to all
