-- bloody clashes between pro- and @entity3 regime fighters raged on early sunday in @entity4 , @entity5 , a day after the deadliest outburst of violence there in recent weeks indicated @entity9 's turmoil continues spilling across borders			1
twelve people were killed and about 50 were wounded in fighting on saturday , the state - run @entity11 reported			1
the clashes continued early sunday morning , killing at least one person , @entity14 said			1
but government intervention appears to have calmed the situation			0
@entity9 president condemns @entity21 massacre , rejects accusations after meeting with leaders from the different factions involved in the clashes , interior minister @entity23 announced that national security forces would enter the area to enforce a cease - fire sunday morning			1
@entity4 residents and the @entity11 news agency said sunday that @entity4 was quiet after the morning clashes , suggesting fighters apparently adhered to the cease - fire			1
at one point on saturday , a continuous stream of rockets hindered national security forces ' attempts to secure the area , the news agency said			0
one rocket exploded over a well - known castle in the city , while another landed some distance away			0
prime minister @entity47 went to @entity4 to assess the security situation , state news reported			1
the sectarian violence in @entity4 -- which is on the @entity51 coast , about 50 miles from @entity52 , @entity9 -- mirrors the tensions in its neighboring nation			2
clashes in both nations pit @entity57 , who make up the majority of the @entity9 opposition and population , against @entity61 and other @entity62 , who are dominant in @entity9 president @entity64 's government			2
@entity57 are the majority in northern @entity5 , where @entity4 is located and where @entity67 factions are relatively strong			1
the @entity9 president , meanwhile , has more support in southern @entity5 and among members of the powerful @entity62 militant and political group @entity72 , which is considered a terrorist organization by @entity75 authorities			2
the recent fighting is not the first time tensions have simmered over , including in @entity4			2
last month , violence flared after @entity5 authorities arrested @entity82 , an @entity83 activist who was helping @entity9 refugees by providing food and shelter , his cousin said			2
@entity5 had accused @entity82 of being an operative in an @entity89 - inspired group -- something his relatives deny			0
the activist was eventually released , but not before his arrest sparked fighting that killed seven people and left dozens wounded			0
elsewhere in @entity5 , the kidnapping of a group of @entity62 pilgrims in @entity9 prompted angry protests last month in @entity100 , the capital			2
also last month , gun battles in @entity100 between rival @entity57 political parties -- one supporting @entity9 's @entity64 and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded			1
that was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where the powerful @entity72 militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008			0
that bloodshed came hours after @entity5 troops killed two @entity113 clerics -- both opposed to the embattled @entity9 regime -- at a checkpoint in northern @entity5			1
@entity9 has long been a major influence in @entity5 , and not just because of the extensive border the two nations share			0
@entity5 was considered part of " greater @entity9 " until the end of @entity121 @entity9 troops were deployed in @entity5 between 1976 and 2005 , primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop @entity5 's long civil war , though they stayed long after the fighting stopped in 1990			1
the @entity9 forces ' 2005 withdrawal followed the car - bomb killing of former prime minister @entity130 in @entity100 , which some blamed on elements of @entity64 's regime			0
since then , @entity5 's most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided -- the ruling pro-syria alliance led by prime minister @entity47 on one side and @entity3 factions led by @entity138 , the son of the assassinated former prime minister , on the other			0
the unrest in @entity9 that began 15 months ago with peaceful anti-government protests , followed by a government crackdown , has meant further complications for @entity5			0
thousands of refugees have poured across the border			0
and in april the @entity5 army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for @entity4 that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in @entity9			1
@entity0 's @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
