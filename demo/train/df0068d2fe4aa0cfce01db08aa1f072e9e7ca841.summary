was col. @entity0 , my grandfather , more of a @entity2 or a @entity3 ? it 's not a question i ever thought my family would be discussing			1
but with the release of " @entity10 " movie , it was one we jokingly started talking about			1
the movie tells the story of an " unlikely @entity14 platoon , tasked by @entity15 with going into @entity16 to rescue artistic masterpieces from @entity19 thieves and returning them to their rightful owners			1
" it 's touted as " @entity22 " meets @entity14 in the film , a motley crew of architects and art experts risk shootouts with @entity28 as they try to protect and save cultural artifacts			1
the movie is n't bad			2
for me , though , it 's special because without it and the book it was based on , i may never have known that my grandfather was one of the real - life @entity37			1
as a kid , i knew my grandfather had been a colonel in the @entity40 , which i thought was pretty cool			1
i also knew he had been an archivist , which was decidedly a bit less cool			0
to me , he was the kind , quiet and slightly reserved grandfather who came with my attention - grabbing , larger - than - life grandmother			2
the family joke was always that he was the colonel , but she was the general			0
we never really talked about what he did , so i figured it involved boring record keeping			0
still , with a distinctive last name , i got a kick out of being " the colonel 's grandson			2
" before the movie , there was the book of the same name written by @entity63 and the foundation he started			2
@entity63 's passion for the subject and his belief that the @entity37 ( almost 350 men and women from 13 countries ) had n't received proper recognition led him to interview my grandfather and others for his book			1
that 's when we first learned his story -- not only what my grandfather had done , but also the scope and significance of what he achieved			1
near the end of @entity14 , my grandfather volunteered for the @entity82 ( the intelligence agency that was the precursor to the @entity84 ) , hoping to go overseas			2
he was assigned to its @entity86 division and spent the last months of the war in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
but it was his post-war assignment that would make him a @entity93			0
in early 1946 , he was assigned to @entity94 , @entity16			2
because of his previous work in the @entity96 , he became a 29 - year old army captain tasked with overseeing a depot filled with whole libraries , documents and cultural artifacts that had been looted by the @entity28			1
when he first walked into the depot , " you feel like crying , " he said in a 1989 interview			2
" here was the horrible , tragic evidence of what happened , " he said , calling it the " cultural holocaust			0
" his job was to make sense of the millions of volumes , a thousand @entity112 scrolls and other objects and to figure out a way to get them back to the countries and institutions they belonged to			1
it does n't sound like an exciting or adventurous job -- not surprisingly , you do n't see a character like my grandfather in the movie			1
but for a quiet , methodical and analytical archivist and the gargantuan task he was up against , it was the perfect match			0
the @entity129 , first under my grandfather and then his successors , managed to restitute more than 3 million objects			1
some of the more prominent collections that he helped to return , both at @entity94 and in later assignments , included the @entity135 family archives to @entity136 , the @entity138 and @entity139 libraries to the @entity140 , and the @entity142 collection , which ended up in @entity143			0
in the grand scope of @entity14 , it 's a tiny story line			0
just a small measure of justice			0
according to my father , my grandfather " really felt he was doing his job			1
he did n't feel like he was n't recognized , did n't think he was a hero			0
" he enjoyed and appreciated being part of a group of @entity37 awarded the @entity154 by president @entity155 in 2007 , but did n't feel like he needed it			0
he passed away in 2011 , but if he were alive today , i think his reaction to the movie would have been the same -- he would have gotten a kick out of it , but probably would have waited to see it on dvd rather than go to the red carpet premiere			0
the way he described it , " here i was , a little captain , and i got thrown into this historical @entity166 episode			0
" as someone who loved him but never felt like i knew him the way i wish i could , it 's a big deal to recast the way you see your grandfather when he 's 90 years old			1
it helps me understand why the archivist was just as cool as the colonel ( as proved by a fellow archivist geeking out over finding a marker he once used ) , and makes it that much more special when i meet someone who still calls me " the colonel 's grandson			0

" @entity10 " movie *rekindles* *memories* of a grandfather 's @entity40 service

@entity0 's job was to get them back to the countries and institutions they belonged to
the depot , under him and his successors , managed to return more than 3 million objects
