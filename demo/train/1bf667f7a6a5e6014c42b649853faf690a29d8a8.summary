civil rights luminaries joined throngs of protesters carrying " justice for @entity5 " signs on saturday , slowly marching to the @entity6 , @entity7 , police headquarters to demand the arrest of 17 - year - old @entity11 's killer			1
" we will march on , we will rally , pray , petition , challenge elected officials , judges , law enforcement , attorneys , in the courthouse and in the @entity18 , until justice for @entity11 is real , " high school senior @entity20 , a member of the @entity22 's @entity21			1
@entity23 , chairwoman of the @entity22 board of directors , urged demonstrators to turn their anger into constructive action , telling them to register and vote			1
" your vote is the key that will unlock justice in this community , " she said			0
organizers said demonstrators arrived on buses from around @entity7 and the @entity35 to participate in the rally , which came 34 days after neighborhood watch volunteer @entity37 fatally shot @entity11 after calling police to report him as a " suspicious " person			1
@entity37 says he killed @entity11 in self - defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk , according to an @entity45 report that was later confirmed by @entity6 police			1
authorities have said @entity37 was not immediately charged because there were no grounds , at the outset , to disprove his account that he 'd acted to protect himself			2
@entity11 's family and supporters say @entity37 , who is @entity54 , racially profiled the teen , who was black , and ignored a police dispatcher 's directive not to follow him			1
the @entity6 police department has come under intense scrutiny for its actions following the shooting , and protesters renewed their call for the firing of police chief @entity65 , who stepped aside temporarily this month amid criticism			2
activists also demand punishment against others involved in the case			2
" the same thing that happened to @entity11 can happen to your kids as well , " said @entity72 @entity22 president @entity71			1
" we want a clean house at @entity78 " video : @entity37 in handcuffs speakers -- included the rev. @entity82 and @entity22 president @entity83 -- described @entity11 's shooting as the latest in a long line of examples in which black men , particularly , have been victims of racially motivated crimes			1
as he has in recent days , the rev. @entity89 said that @entity11 's killing is symptomatic in part of the larger problem of violence in the @entity94			1
yet he also said he believes that the teenager 's skin color contributed to his death			2
" this is about race profiling , and therefore a quest for racial justice , " said @entity89 , who added later , " it 's hope time , it 's healing time			2
" @entity11 's parents did not attend the @entity6 event , though they were at one later saturday at a park in @entity105 , @entity7			1
unlike the rallies condemning racial profiling and calling for justice in their son 's case -- which occurred saturday not just in @entity6 , but also in places such as @entity113 and @entity114 , @entity115 -- the event in @entity105 was more about remembering @entity11 , the person			1
the teenager had played for the @entity119 football program , where his father was a coach			0
many of the scores in attendance saturday night knew him personally			2
" @entity5 was a young , handsome , hardworking kid , " one of his former coaches , @entity126 , told @entity127			0
" he gave you his all			0
" at a news conference that preceded the @entity6 march , @entity83 and @entity82 took pains to rebut reports that @entity82 's @entity134 was considering calling for a boycott of @entity6 or @entity72			2
@entity82 said such a boycott was " never on the table			0
" but he said he would consider action against businesses supporting efforts on behalf of @entity7 's " stand your ground " law , which police have cited as a reason they did not immediately arrest @entity37			1
the law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury			0
critics say it is a " shoot first " law that justifies violence			0
opinion : @entity11 's death more than teachable moment a special prosecutor appointed by gov. @entity159 is investigating the case , as is the @entity94 @entity161			1
an open letter on the @entity22 's website -- directed at the special prosecutor , @entity164 -- points to what it calls " evidence of racial bias , investigative mishaps , and the true nature of the circumstances surrounding @entity5 's killing ( that ) have shaken us to the core ... " however , nothing shakes us more than the knowledge that @entity11 's killer , @entity37 , remains free			1
" the letter ends with a plea for @entity179 " to prosecute the case judiciously , and to passionately pursue justice			2
" in an interview thursday with @entity127 's @entity183 , the shooter 's brother , @entity183 , questioned the job done by @entity179 's office thus far			0
in depth : @entity127 peels back the layers he cited leaks of details -- which have not been confirmed to have come from @entity179 or her office -- and described the account that his brother " chased a person " as " absolutely false			0
" " ms. @entity164 's investigation has been compromised , " the brother said			0
@entity7 attorney general @entity200 stood staunchly behind @entity179 , in an interview friday with @entity127 's @entity202			1
she noted that @entity159 appointed @entity179 after consulting with her			0
she is tough as nails			0
she is compassionate , " @entity200 said			0
" and if any leaks are coming out of this investigation , it is certainly not from @entity164 's office			0
" @entity200 added that she thought criticism of @entity179 -- both by those , like @entity183 , who support @entity37 and those calling for his prompt arrest -- " completely undermines the integrity of the investigation			2
" what the witnesses are saying everyone involved , @entity200 said , would be best off if they " wait and let ( the investigation ) happen			0
" that means being patient in the face of fervent demands from activists that @entity37 be detained and charged as soon as possible , said the attorney general			1
" you never want to make an arrest too soon , " @entity200 said			0
" we need justice , but you never want to make an arrest without having all the answers			0
" while @entity37 has not spoken out about the case , his family members have taken their case public this week			1
besides the brother , @entity183 -- the shooter 's father -- told @entity239 tv station @entity238 that @entity11 " continued to beat @entity37 " and he said something to the effect of , " you 're going to die now			1
" but as more information surfaces , the picture of what happened between @entity11 and @entity37 becomes more complicated			2
despite the twists and turns , @entity245 , @entity11 's mother , has said that she still has faith in authorities investigating her son 's case			1
" i feel confident that they 're going to do a thorough investigation , " she said			0
" we 're trying to be patient , even though it 's been over a month			0
we 're trying to be patient , and we 're trying to press on for justice			0
