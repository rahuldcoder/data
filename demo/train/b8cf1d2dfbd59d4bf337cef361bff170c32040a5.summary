-- the thing i find most surprising about @entity3 is that there are n't two rival @entity3 movies			1
the @entity8 movie has the look and feel of @entity12 / @entity11 and @entity14 / @entity13 ( though , believe it or not , @entity6 was once attached to direct )			2
alas , @entity3 has the field to itself , a big - budget @entity18 disaster epic that lands smack in the box - office dead zone of february			1
it 's just crazy enough to work ! @entity22 ' @entity21 plays @entity23 , a @entity26 slave - turned - gladiator who catches the eye of an upper - class beauty ( @entity30 ) who in turn is promised to the corrupt @entity26 politician ( @entity33 ) who butchered his family			1
conflict ! @entity21 sculpted his body to look the part of a gladiator , but @entity0 's @entity39 thinks @entity41 's @entity40 from @entity42 is n't in danger of being surpassed anytime soon , writing , " @entity21 knows how to handle a broadsword , but mostly he comes off as the @entity46 @entity45 , a glorified fashion model striking @entity48 poses that smolder , boringly			1
" there also happens to be the looming destruction bubbling up from @entity52 , the @entity53 volcano that annihilated @entity3 in 79 a.d. the critics are mixed on whether the volcano is the film 's villain or hero			1
read below to see what they 're saying about @entity3 before heading to the theaters this weekend			1
@entity39 ( @entity0 ) ▼ " the volcano spews an endless shower of fiery asteroids trailed by smoky plumes — an apocalyptic fireworks show that takes down the city			2
... bodies get frozen into sculptures of ash that will last forever			2
it 's supposed to make this love story timeless , but by the end of @entity3 , you 'll be grateful that the movie only lasts 104 minutes			1
" @entity76 ( @entity77 ) " taking a page from @entity80 , the film invents a rich - girl / poor - boy romance , puts a powerful suitor in their way and then besets their star - crossed love story with @entity86 lava showers , rendered all the more spectacular in stereoscopic 3 - d. in short , @entity3 is a blast , at least by guilty - pleasure standards ... " @entity90 ( @entity91 ) ▼ " as for the fact that there 's no reason to care whom the fireballs hit , or who gets covered in lava , or whose house caves , or whose ship blows up -- well , that 's unfortunate			1
although , if you think of @entity3 as a ride , a conveyance for special effects , and not anything resembling an emotional experience , indifference can almost be a good thing			1
" @entity109 ( @entity110 ) ▼ " the lava flows by the ton , as does the cheese , in @entity3 , a kitschy apocalyptic peplum whose visual epiphanies — of which there are definitely a few — can not outdo a @entity118 - or d - ) grade scenario that will have lots of eyes rolling by the time the big stack finally blows			2
" @entity123 ( @entity124 ) " besides @entity42 and @entity80 , the film borrows from 300 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , and even @entity126			2
the result is a generic saga with a cast of forgettable one - dimensional characters			0
" @entity134 ( @entity135 ) " sure , it 's not the brainiest of outings , but director @entity8 ( the man behind four of the resident evil films ) keeps the action apace and the lava a-flowing with workmanlike energy and sufficient visual dazzle			0
" @entity144 ( @entity145 ) " @entity8 displays his mastery as a director in the sword - fighting scenes			0
the camera glides and tilts in exact counterpoint to the thrusts of the knives , as if a bloody ballet			0
these scenes recall the elegance and deftness of great car chases from films like @entity159			0
" @entity161 ( @entity160 ) " no doubt the audiences in the @entity163 would offer a thumbs - up to the scale of the destruction , though even they might have had some quibbles about the special effects , which , too often , resemble a very large pile of melting crayons			0
" @entity171 ( @entity172 ) " the dialogue is often pleasantly leaden ( " i 've never seen you look at any man the way you looked at that slave ! " one of @entity181 's friends says as she ogles the buff @entity23 ) , but the sound effects are way cool , and the @entity18 is spectacular , with glowing ashes that seem to float off the screen and onto your lap. " @entity187 ( @entity188 ) ▼ " @entity190 's star is on the rise			2
... yet his first starring role does n't showcase what he can do from an acting standpoint			0
@entity21 transformed his body for the role , but here 's the real disaster : his startlingly defined six - pack abs are the most memorable part of his character			1
" @entity203 ( @entity204 ) ▼ " @entity30 often looks like a woman on the brink of an orgasm			0
it 's as if she 's trying to out - act the volcano			0
the eruption starts early and lasts most of the movie			0
( it 's tantric that way			0
) " @entity3 overall @entity215 rating ( 1 - 100 ) : 41 @entity216 : 31 percent rated : @entity217 length : 104 minutes director : @entity8 starring @entity21 , @entity30 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity33 distributor : @entity225 see the original story at @entity0			1
