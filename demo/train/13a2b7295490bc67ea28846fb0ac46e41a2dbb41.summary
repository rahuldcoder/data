@entity0 -- president @entity2 walked into the @entity3 nearly six years ago with a robust @entity5 majority and a promise to change politics			1
now , he 's heading into his final years of office estranged from @entity9 in the minority on @entity11 , facing @entity12 uninterested in making big compromises and a public that has largely moved on from the heady early days of the administration			1
@entity2 is " anxious to get back to work " and put the midterms behind him , according to a @entity3 official who spoke on the condition of anonymity , adding the president regards the final two years of his term as a " fourth quarter " with the potential for real action			1
he is scheduled to address the midterm results on wednesday afternoon , just as he did in 2010 when he labeled the @entity12 takeover the @entity3 a " shellacking			2
" the @entity3 invited bipartisan congressional leaders for a meeting on friday afternoon to map out the lawmaking terrain for the next two years			2
and administration aides are bullish about extending their strategy of going ahead with executive actions in areas where congressional cooperation appears impossible			1
but for @entity2 , the time for major legislative moves that would build his legacy could be short			1
with the midterms out of the way , the attentions of both parties will soon shift to the 2016 presidential campaign , leaving little appetite for bipartisan agreement			2
achieving any legislative deals will require a level of compromise the @entity3 has n't yet been open to ; it will also depend on a fractured @entity12 's willingness to pass measures that have any hope of getting the president 's signature			2
in public , both sides say they 're ready to find common ground -- " we 're ready to compromise , " vice president @entity57 told @entity1 monday -- though aides are more pessimistic in private			1
asked whether the president will be looking to compromise and take a more conciliatory tone with a @entity12 @entity5 , a @entity3 official said the " better question is whether the @entity12 wants to work with us			2
" previous attempts by the @entity3 to woo republicans , including dinners and other meetings with @entity2 , did not materialize into compromise , the official pointed out			1
@entity12 have likewise expressed some willingness to find common ground with @entity2 , though if four years of rancorous relations with the @entity3 @entity12 are any indication , that willingness may be fleeting			1
the conservative wing of the party has resisted @entity2 at nearly every move , so much so that the @entity3 has kept meetings between house speaker @entity78 and @entity2 secret			1
" what the @entity12 are very likely to do is to go in two directions at once , " said @entity80 , a former adviser to presidents @entity81 and @entity82			2
" on the one hand , they 'll try and look as if they were cooperative with the president			0
on the other hand , they are going to play hardball			0
" even with a @entity12 controlled @entity5 , conservative brass rings like repealing the @entity93 or making major cuts to government spending programs like @entity96 and @entity97 will still be blocked by @entity2 's veto			1
and while a @entity12 @entity5 may still take up those measures to exemplify their ideological splits with the @entity3 , there is virtually no chance they become law			0
@entity105 immigration reform , a longtime goal of @entity2 's that was blocked last year by the @entity12 controlled @entity3 , will likely arise again in the new @entity108 as @entity12 seek to boost their popularity among @entity111 voters			1
some @entity12 , like 2012 @entity12 nominee @entity113 , have argued immigration reform might have a better chance of succeeding with a @entity12 @entity5 , however the deeply divided @entity12 caucus in the @entity3 has n't shown many signs of uniting around a plan			0
further complicating the equation : @entity2 's vow to take unilateral action to address the millions of undocumented immigrants currently inside the @entity121			1
originally expected at the end of the summer , the unveiling was pushed until after the midterm votes to avoid political fallout			0
the @entity3 says they 'll announce their plan before the end of the year			0
that leaves lower - profile items , with less political baggage , for @entity2 and the new @entity12 @entity108 to haggle over			1
that could include reforming the tax code and brokering new trade deals â € ” areas both the @entity3 and @entity12 agree need attention			0
those are also items that could cause some heartburn for @entity9 , whose populist message does n't necessarily align with lowering corporate tax rates or fostering new trade pacts			0
sen. @entity143 , the @entity9 majority leader , issued a blow to @entity2 's economic agenda earlier this year when he refused to allow " fast track " legislation on proposed trade deals with @entity148 and @entity149			1
some republicans at the time complained @entity2 did n't do enough to convince fellow @entity9 to support his trade agenda			1
a @entity12 - controlled @entity5 could offer a better chance to see it through			0
a tax reform measure that lowers rates on corporations could similarly gain more traction in a @entity12 controlled @entity5 , though disagreements on the size of the reduction â € ” and potential new revenue â € ” could stymie any deal			0
on major legacy - building items , legislative action seems impossible , leaving open the chances for executive actions more limited in scope			2
he 's already moved to curb carbon emissions at coal powered plants , and further climate actions are likely			0
officials say he remains committed to closing the prison at @entity176 , despite continued opposition from @entity108 to transferring prisoners into the @entity121 the losses tuesday wo n't necessarily change the overall calculus in @entity0 ; gridlock has been the norm at least since @entity12 took control of the @entity3 in 2010			0
the way @entity9 lost the @entity5 , however , has caused some consternation within @entity2 's own party			1
" running away from the president is never smart , " said one top @entity9 strategist who has worked with both the @entity3 and @entity5 candidates this midterm cycle			0
" you look like chicken s ---			0
" intra-party squabbling is a longstanding tradition for losing parties , and the @entity3 would surely have appreciated more talk of the improving economy on the campaign trail			0
administration officials say a major staff shake - up is n't in the works -- for now -- and that @entity2 is n't planning to come out and accept blame for @entity9 losses			1
he previewed his explanation tuesday , saying in a @entity206 radio interview the electoral map was to blame			0
" this is probably the worst possible group of states for democrats since @entity211 , " he said			0
at least for the immediate future , however , the @entity3 is moving on from the domestic political environment that left @entity2 battered , and in many races , unwelcome			2
he leaves sunday for a week - long diplomatic visit to @entity148 , 6,000 miles from the redrawn @entity0 .			0

@entity2 is " anxious to get back to work " after midterms
administration aides are bullish about issuing executive orders
