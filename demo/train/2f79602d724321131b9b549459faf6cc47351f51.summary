@entity0 -- from end to end , the @entity2 has looked like a construction site all summer , providing a detour instead of a destination for many tourists , joggers and other visitors			2
that will change this weekend , when the renovated @entity12 at the west end will be filled to its new capacity			1
and fresh turf at the other end will soon be taking root ahead of january 's presidential inauguration			1
" it is indeed disruptive , " said @entity19 , the @entity20 's superintendent for the @entity2 area , acknowledging that for " some people , this may be their first and only trip to @entity0 , and we hate areas shut down			1
" especially in hot weather , the @entity12 at the foot of the @entity12 draws visitors to sit by the water			1
but in a project that began in late 2010 , the pool was drained of 7 million gallons of water , the foundation dug up and removed , and , in the months that followed , a new concrete base poured and sealed			2
most of the work is done , and as of wednesday , " the pool 's about half full , " said @entity39 of @entity40 , the contractor doing the renovations			0
" we have about , almost 2 million gallons of water to go yet			0
" a year after quake , @entity45 still under repair @entity12 should be refilled by weekend barring complications , pumps that are drawing water from the @entity49 along the @entity50 will have topped off the @entity12 by this weekend			1
the old structure held more water , but filtering was poor , and the foundation was leaking			0
the new structure is shallower , with better filtration for less water , and the concrete floor is tinted to maintain its visual impact of reflection			0
at the east end of the @entity2 , nearest the @entity63 , earth - moving equipment , mountains of topsoil and teams of construction crews are finishing some yard work that will create a more durable place for inaugural spectators and other gatherings			0
two joggers stopped at a sign the park service had placed at the edge of the site to help people make sense of all the activity as visitors detour around temporary fences , concrete barriers and construction apparatus			0
" it definitely gives us an uglier view as we run in the mornings , " @entity88 said , " and the dust , the noise level as well , so , yeah , it 's been here a while , and we ca n't wait to get finished			0
" turf ready for presidential inauguration in january @entity95 explained that crews " are re-engineering the soil , we are collecting storm water in large cisterns , we have an irrigation system in place , and eventually we 'll be placing new sod " to take root during the current growing season through autumn			1
" we do think that this is going to lead to a better end product , and it 's going to sustain the @entity2 for future generations , " @entity95 said			0
he says the turf project must include the spring and summer months to help the newly planted grass thrive			0
the area has been a prime gathering point for a view to presidential inaugurations at the @entity116 of the @entity63			1
and @entity95 says the turf will be ready for crowds by january			1
farther along the @entity2 , the @entity45 remains closed because of damage from an earthquake that took place a year ago , on august 23 , 2011			1
the @entity20 will soon announce the contract for repairs to the obelisk			2
a reopening date for the monument has not been announced			2
