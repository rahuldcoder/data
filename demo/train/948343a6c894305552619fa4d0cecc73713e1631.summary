-- @entity1 , who teaches @entity2 as a second language in @entity4 , sat down in the school staff room to check her e-mail			1
one of the messages in her inbox was from an acquaintance she 'd been corresponding with since their 50th high school reunion last year			1
in a survey of 4,000 people , about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person			1
but this e-mail last june did n't contain chummy banter or reminiscences			1
it simply included a lewd photo of a partly unclothed young man			0
the file name of the picture was " @entity26			0
" " i was shocked ! " says @entity1 , 68			0
she hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind			1
later that day , the sender e-mailed an apology to her and two dozen others who had received the e-mail			2
he explained he 'd been experimenting with his new computer and was trying to figure out how to add attachments to an e-mail , @entity1 says			1
in doing so , he attached an image from his desktop and tried to send it to himself			0
instead , the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently did n't realize until after he hit the " send " button			2
" i felt terrible for him , " @entity1 says			0
" i could imagine just how mortified he must have been			0
" with some 55 billion e-mails being sent daily ( not including spam ) , according to e-mail archiving company @entity51 , misdirected e-mails have become the online equivalent of a wrong number			1
they 're unavoidable , annoying -- and often embarrassing			2
the ' uh-oh ' e-mail in a recent online survey conducted by @entity58 , 32 percent of the 4,000 respondents have at one time or another mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to an unintended recipient			1
and often , it 's something not so nice			2
@entity64 , an account executive at an ad agency in @entity66 , @entity67 , knows just how embarrassing that can be			1
in 2004 , @entity64 met a guy at a concert and went out with him a few times , but ultimately realized she was n't interested			0
" he was just awkward and clumsy			0
and sometimes i 'd catch him staring at me , which really creeped me out , " she says			2
she tried to end the relationship by simply not returning his phone calls			0
" but then he e-mailed and casually said that he had not heard from me in a while and he hoped everything was fine but just assumed i was busy , " says @entity64 , 31			0
" before i returned his e-mail , i sent the message to a close girlfriend with a blurb about what an idiot i thought he was and that dating him was a bad idea because he had no understanding of social cues			2
" she thought she sent the " he 's an idiot " e-mail only to her girlfriend			1
to her horror , @entity64 says , the spurned beau replied a few minutes later , calling her some not - so - sweet names and suggesting that she " share this e-mail with your friends			1
" " i was speechless , " says @entity64 , who chose to not respond			0
" but eventually i was able to laugh at it			0
" when errant e-mails are sent at work , however , there 's often much more at stake than personal embarrassment			2
three years ago , @entity106 , 33 , e-mailed his then - boss to ask about a client at the public relations firm where he was working			2
his boss wrote back , criticizing the client as incompetent and urging @entity106 to " go around him if you want to get anything done			0
" unfortunately , @entity106 says , she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops , make that ex-client			2
" one click , and suddenly we 'd lost a $ 5 million account , " says @entity106 , who is now self - employed as a publicist in @entity117 , @entity118			1
can you turn back time ? short of erasing someone 's memory , there is no surefire way to retrieve a missent e-mail			1
@entity128 has a " recall " function that can erase unread e-mails from the in - box of the recipient -- as long as the recipient is using the same mail client or server as the sender -- as does @entity58 , but only for messages between @entity58 users			1
( both @entity58 and @entity140 are divisions of @entity141			0
) then there 's @entity143 , an e-mail service which lets you tinker with ( or even erase ) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created , stored and viewed on a remote server , where they can be edited or revoked at any time ; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message , even though it looks like a regular e-mail			1
but old - fashioned vigilance is probably the best way to avert these snafus in the first place			2
@entity162 , ceo of e-mail archiving company @entity163 and keeper of the blog @entity166 , believes the easiest way to avoid these mistakes is to forget that the " reply all " button even exists			1
" simply put , there is rarely a real reason to use it , " he says			0
" often , when you hit it , you end up e-mailing people who were blind carbon copied without realizing			0
" @entity162 offers the following tips on avoiding e-mail embarrassment : type out the person 's full name when addressing your e-mail			1
if you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book , it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it			1
double - check the addresses of your intended recipients before you hit " send			0
" do you really want all the people to get this particular message ? be sure to notify your company 's legal department if there is any chance that governance , compliance or privacy regulations were violated as a result of something you sent by mistake			0
immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and , if possible , ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away			1
