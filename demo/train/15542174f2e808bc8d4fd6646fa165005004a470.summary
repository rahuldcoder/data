-- for some families , like the @entity1 , the @entity2 and the @entity3 , politics runs in the blood			0
but as history shows , coming from a powerful political family does n't mean a free ride to the top			1
@entity11 and @entity12 are the only sons of a president to make it to the governor 's mansion			0
" it does help , and it hurts			2
it 's a two - edged sword , " said @entity19 , a presidential historian and former adviser to president @entity21			1
" it initially helps the candidate with name recognition and more importantly with fundraising ... but many vote against the child as well			0
" the children of political families inherit a treasure chest of contacts , campaign workers and often endorsements , but the benefits have their limits			2
only two presidential sons have followed their fathers to the @entity39 ( @entity40 and @entity41 ) , and just one presidential family -- the @entity2 -- has sent sons to the governor 's mansion ( @entity12 in @entity46 and @entity21 in @entity47 )			2
" i conclude that a brand name -- a famous family name -- is typically worth one step up on the political ladder , " said @entity48 , a senior fellow emeritus in governance studies at the @entity50 , who has researched and written about political dynasties dating back to colonial times			1
" they get one step up -- and they are on their own			2
" @entity62 , for example , had two sons make it to @entity65 , but both failed in their gubernatorial bids			0
" in both cases , then they were on their own			0
as they tried to step up to one higher level , both of them were defeated , " noted @entity48 , who served as a staffer of the @entity71 and @entity72 administrations and as an adviser to presidents @entity74 and @entity75			1
among some other high - profile names whose political aspirations came up short , @entity84 's son @entity83 , who was the mayor of @entity85 , @entity86 , lost his bid to be the governor of the state ; his other son -- sen. @entity91 -- tried three times without success to win the @entity95 nomination for president			2
( @entity91 's son served in @entity65 , and his grandson served as the governor of @entity86 for two terms )			0
president @entity102 's daughter @entity101 failed in her run for a @entity106 @entity105 seat , and the son of @entity108 -- a former vice president and @entity110 presidential nominee -- was defeated in @entity112 's 1998 gubernatorial election , losing to third party candidate and ex-wrestler @entity115			0
sometimes , the public wants a candidate to lose an election or two , " just to let them know that they can not be taken for granted , " said @entity19 , author of the 2004 book " all the @entity123 ' children : @entity124 and tragedy in the lives of @entity128 's @entity127			1
" in 1997 , then - rep. @entity130 , son of @entity132 sen. @entity131 and nephew of president @entity134 , bailed out of the @entity136 gubernatorial race			0
@entity134 had never formally announced his candidacy , but he had been considered the front - runner before a string of bad headlines caught up with him			0
" @entity130 backed down when he saw the polls and saw that the media was n't going to give him a free ride on his personal life , " @entity19 said			1
@entity134 's older sister , @entity146 , failed in her attempt to move from lieutenant governor of @entity149 to governor , even though registered @entity110 outnumbered @entity95 2 - 1 , @entity19 said			1
outside of the @entity39 , familial ties are often beneficial to candidates who stay close to home -- in the same state , if not in the same congressional district			0
in @entity159 , four members of the @entity158 family have served in @entity65 , dating back to the late 1700s , and in @entity162 , the @entity161 family has produced generations of congressmen and governors			2
in the case of @entity167 , who is seeking one of @entity170 's @entity105 seats , being the son of @entity47 rep. @entity172 probably wo n't have much impact on his chances , based on @entity48 's observations			1
" this thing is off the board in that regard , " said @entity48 , noting that @entity167 is not even in the same state , much less district , as his father			1
" i ca n't imagine that @entity172 , a sort of maverick congressman from @entity47 , should make a lot of difference in his son 's race			0
" for those who do make it into office , winning an election can turn into more of a burden than a boon , because with a recognizable name comes a legacy -- and the pressure to defend it			1
@entity197 was widely considered a better speaker , debater , fundraiser and politician than his father , @entity202 , who served as the eighth president of the @entity128			0
@entity197 won a seat in the @entity205 the same year his father lost his re-election bid			0
but , @entity19 noted , once he got to the floor of the @entity39 , he resurrected old battles in an attempt to restore his father 's legacy and failed to develop his own political identity			1
more recently , when @entity41 took office , " he fought his father 's old battles literally , " @entity19 said			1
faced with complaints that his father , @entity21 , reneged on his tax pledge and failed to bring an end to @entity224 's regime in @entity225 , " the son tied all the loose ends and cleaned the slate , but at a great cost , " @entity19 said			1
some observers argue that @entity41 has so damaged the family brand that if @entity12 -- who was wildly popular as a two - term governor -- were to consider a presidential run , he 'd have to change his last name			0
but @entity19 does n't see it that way			1
" it does n't matter how much in disgrace the @entity12 family name may be for the moment -- they are a huge money - making machine			0
" " i think the family really knows that the thing the people hate , tomorrow they can love , " he added			2
that was the case with the @entity246 , the only other family to yield a father - son presidential duo , @entity19 said			1
" people would suddenly look with nostalgia at an administration that they hated			0
it happened with the @entity40 , " @entity19 said			2

coming from a big political name " does help , and it hurts , " @entity19 says
family name is " worth one step up on the political ladder , " @entity48 says
the pressure to defend a legacy can stifle a political *career* , @entity19 says
even if a name is disgraced today , its image can be restored tomorrow , @entity19 says
