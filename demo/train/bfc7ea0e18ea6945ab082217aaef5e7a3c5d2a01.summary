@entity0 -- a controversial @entity3 politician apologized monday for suggesting that @entity6 military service members should use the adult entertainment industry in @entity3 more often to relieve sexual frustration and reduce aggression			1
but he did n't back down over comments he made about the @entity3 military 's use of forced prostitution during @entity14 @entity3 politician calls wartime sex slaves ' necessary ' @entity17 , the mayor of @entity18 , stirred outrage in @entity3 and around the world with a series of comments this month about the treatment of women by the military			1
he had said may 13 that he had told a @entity6 military commander during a trip to a base on the island of @entity30 that the adult entertainment business in @entity3 should be " utilized more " by @entity6 personnel			1
" i told him there are places that operate within the boundaries of the law which can be used for releasing sexual frustration , so they ( the @entity6 military ) should fully utilize it or the @entity41 wo n't be able to control their aggressive sexual desires			2
" in a statement delivered monday at the foreign correspondent 's @entity44 in @entity0 , @entity17 acknowledged that his comment " could be construed as an insult to the @entity6 forces and to the @entity6 people , and therefore was inappropriate			2
" @entity17 , who is also a co-leader of the @entity50 , said he retracted the remark and apologized for it			2
he said it was prompted by " a strong sense of crisis " he felt in light of a series of recent sexual abuse cases involving @entity6 service members in @entity3			2
opinion : @entity3 politicians still struggle with wartime past ' comfort women ' controversy but he said comments attributed to him that described women forced to become prostitutes to entertain @entity3 troops during @entity14 as " necessary " had been taken out of context			1
on may 13 , he said " anyone would understand " the role of " comfort women " when soldiers were risking their lives and you wanted to give them " a rest			2

the @entity6 government called the words " outrageous and offensive			0
" @entity17 did n't offer an apology monday for those comments , claiming that he had been talking about sexual violations by military personnel in a more general sense			1
he also disputed that forcible recruitment of women during the war was conducted as government policy			0
" i stated that ' the armed forces of nations in the world ' seemed to have needed women ' during the past wars , ' " he said			0
" then it was wrongly reported that i myself thought it as necessary for armed forces to use women and that ' i ' tolerated it			0
" @entity3 not only culprit , mayor says he repeated the assertion he made previously that " sexual violation in wartime was not an issue unique to the former @entity3 army			0
" " the issue existed in the armed forces of the @entity6 , the @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120 among others during @entity14 , " he said			0
" it also existed in the armed forces of the @entity90 during the @entity125 and the @entity126 , " @entity17 added , using the official name of @entity90			0
" if only @entity3 is blamed , because of the widely held view that the state authority of @entity3 was intentionally involved in the abduction and trafficking of women , i will have to inform you that this view is incorrect , " he said			0
he did , however , recognize that the @entity3 military had caused suffering to comfort women			1
" we must express our deep remorse at the violation of the human rights of these women by the @entity3 soldiers in the past , and make our apology to the women , " he said			0
in 1993 , the @entity3 government released a statement acknowledging the " immeasurable pain and suffering " endured by thousands of women forced into sex during @entity14 it even vowed to include the comfort women issue in new junior high school textbooks for the first time			1
