-- @entity2 soccer giants @entity1 increased the value of their club by 76 % over the past year to usurp @entity5 as the world 's most valuable football team			1
a study by financial experts @entity10 found that @entity1 's value now stands at $ 3.3 billion , knocking the @entity13 champions elect off the top of the list for the first time since the study began in 2004			1
confounding the increasingly difficult economic conditions in @entity2 , @entity1 , managed by @entity20 coach @entity19 , have increased revenues to $ 650 million			1
their operating income of $ 134 million is second only to the $ 227 million amassed by the @entity25 's @entity24 , which is the highest of all sports teams			2
@entity5 , on the brink of securing a record 20th @entity29 top flight title , increased their value by 42 % to $ 3.17 billion , according to @entity10			1
despite dropping to second behind @entity1 , @entity5 have boosted revenues with a share issue and by signing bumper sponsorship deals			1
their seven - year shirt sponsorship deal with @entity36 car giant @entity35 is worth $ 559 million while an eight - year agreement with insurance firm @entity38 is thought to be worth $ 230 million			2
all @entity40 's top flight clubs have been boosted by an increase in television revenue with the combined domestic and overseas rights having the potential to top $ 6 billion , @entity10 say			1
@entity1 's arch rivals @entity46 are third on the list with a value of $ 2.6 billion , @entity29 club @entity45 lie fourth on $ 1.32 billion while @entity50 champions @entity49 sit fifth on $ 1.3 billion			1
the top 20 clubs , all but one of which are @entity54 , are worth an average of $ 968 million , which is up 26 % on last year			1
@entity56 , who now plays for @entity58 club @entity57 , is again the best - paid soccer star with earnings of $ 50.6 million while @entity1 's @entity60 is second on $ 43.5m			1
@entity46 's @entity61 is third on $ 40.3m			2
@entity10 say they value teams by calculating their " enterprise values ( equity plus debt ) that are based on multiples of revenue that teams garner from television , premium seating , media , licensing , merchandise and concessions			2
" but speaking to @entity0 , sports business expert @entity75 questioned the relevance of measuring value in this way			0
" @entity1 , @entity5 and @entity46 are all in the top - 10 list of the most indebted clubs in the world , even if their revenue streams are healthy and strongly established , " he said			1
" the implication of measuring value in this way seems to be that many clubs in the top - 10 are simply buying their success by signing players , building debt and winning trophies			0
" it will be interesting to see the extent to which the @entity94 initiative moderates valuations in coming @entity10 league tables			0
" @entity94 's new rules are designed to make @entity99 's clubs live within their means and attempt to break even each year , though there is an allowance for debt in the initial stages of their strategy			0
@entity75 believes the figures underline just how immune soccer is to the financial difficulties being experienced in @entity99			0
he says the upward spiral shows no signs of abating			0
" while football clubs clearly have tremendous financial value and commercial potential , some of the figures being reported here are staggering , " he added			0
" for @entity1 to almost double its financial value in 12 months is incredible , especially set against the backdrop of economic austerity ( particularly in @entity2 ) and competition from other sports and industrial sectors			2
" if these figures are a truly accurate and rigorous measure of value , then they are stunning			0
even at the top - end of the game , clubs are relatively underdeveloped as commercial entities			0
" with changes in management practice , a stronger commercial emphasis , and global marketplace development , then one can only speculate how much further the value of top clubs might increase			0

@entity1 are the world 's most valuable football club according to @entity10
@entity2 claim top spot from @entity29 club @entity5 for first time
@entity1 's value increased by 76 % over the past year to stand at $ 3.3 billion
