@entity0 , @entity1 -- immediately before 9 - 11 , @entity3 was considered almost below most @entity5 ' notice			1
one @entity8 / @entity7 poll found that in early 2002 , only 14 percent of @entity5 thought @entity9 encouraged violence			1
these days , the popular perception of @entity9 is dominated by @entity3 and its radical agenda			1
@entity3 has grown into a monster that dominates the @entity15 psyche , and many non-muslims fear that the majority of @entity18 are bent on violent takeover			1
throughout the last decade , the mainstream majority of @entity18 have seemed almost silent , but today that all changes			2
as of this writing , 38 of the 50 @entity9 scholars who make up @entity1 's @entity18 mainstream leadership have signed the @entity25 of @entity26 , released today			1
these signatories will lead @entity18 communities onto a path of active engagement , taking back @entity9 and claiming it for multicultural peace			1
here is why : @entity18 have been part of @entity15 society for more than 100 years			2
there have been mosques in places such as @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 ; and @entity47 , @entity48 , since the 1930s			0
in @entity1 and the @entity5 before 9 - 11 , the growing @entity18 minority was well - integrated , with higher - than - average educational attainments for both genders			1
muslims in civic and business leadership positions went as unnoticed as members of any other successful community			0
and @entity15 's @entity18 were proud to be an integral part of @entity15 society , because we knew it was the @entity18 ideal as well			2
radicals are working to destroy those relationships and are using the @entity63 to do it			0
radicals regularly , ignorantly and blatantly abuse the @entity63 and the @entity65 ( the acts of @entity67 that @entity18 use to figure out what the revelations really mean ) to promote the idea that @entity9 is a violent faith			1
for example , they cite a famous verse in the quran that says , roughly , " fight the people of the book until they know themselves subdued , " and use it to create fear or to support a violent agenda			0
however , here 's what that verse really means			0
when @entity67 and his companions " conquered " the @entity89 in the 7th century , the command to do so came in response to rumours of an army massing in the north that was planning to exterminate them			0
the @entity18 expected a fight to the death but met people willing to live in peace , and they founded a society with rights , freedom , liberty and justice for all , regardless of race , creed or gender			2
@entity102 was n't telling them when to fight , he was telling them when to stop			0
while the vast majority of imams today put this verse in historical perspective for their congregations , this declaration now serves to put those who would abuse it in perspective as well			0
likewise , radicals claim @entity9 is anti-semitic			2
and yet , when @entity113 fell , @entity112 walked up to the gates and accepted the @entity117 patriarch 's demands for security , religious freedom and relative autonomy with one proviso : that those rights also be afforded to the 70 @entity124 families who had been expelled by the patriarch			0
claims that @entity9 wants to destroy @entity127 are answered by @entity112 's refusal of the patriarch 's invitation to pray in the @entity127 cathedral , " that later generations not declare it a mosque , so that it will remain a church forever			2
" in fact , equality before the courts in @entity67 's time was so profound that when @entity18 extorted land from a @entity124 citizen and built a mosque , the caliph had the mosque destroyed and the land returned			2
@entity18 around the world offer thoughts on what @entity9 means today @entity150 ideals are @entity18 ideals			1
when @entity3 ( whose leaders are described in @entity18 prophecy as " men with the hearts of demons " ) launched its 9 - 11 attack , the primary objective was to alienate @entity15 's @entity18 from the @entity15 they love			1
@entity3 hoped to turn both sides away from those ideals that made both civilizations great			2
and their success at this alienation has remained woefully unchallenged until now			0
that alienation drives @entity18 to criminal acts here and abroad even though they should know better , and it is driving @entity15 and @entity1 into repudiating every good freedom we have attained			1
violence and rivalries have no place in faith -- any faith			1
many @entity174 think they 've begun the first blows of @entity176 , even though @entity18 believe we 're the army of the returning @entity178			0
i have @entity124 friends in @entity1 who think @entity181 are descended from @entity182 ( whom @entity124 are commanded to exterminate ) , even though @entity184 , @entity185 and other @entity187 monotheist tribes populate the @entity188			0
@entity189 and @entity190 married proto - @entity181			0
our religions are actually designed to help us live in peace , if you read their stories looking for something other than war			0
for the sake of peace , @entity9 must be claimed back from @entity18 and @entity200 alike who seek conflict			1
the @entity25 of @entity26 of religious freedom , gender equity , life 's sanctity and individual freedom of choice , declared by the elite of @entity1 's scholarly and respected religious leadership on behalf of all of @entity1 's mainstream @entity18 communities , denies the rights of radicals to define our religion			1
it empowers the voices of @entity18 who love @entity9 and repudiates anyone who seeks to use @entity9 for any purpose but peace			1
yes , it 's a big thing , and it 's happening today			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			0
