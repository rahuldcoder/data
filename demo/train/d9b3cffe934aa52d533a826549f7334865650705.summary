-- as many as 200 foreign fighters affiliated with @entity2 may now be hiding in southern @entity3 , according to the latest assessments by the @entity6 military and intelligence community			1
two @entity6 military officials confirmed the estimate to @entity0 , emphasizing it is only an estimate because of the lack of direct intelligence information from the ground			0
it comes as a senior @entity6 official separately confirmed to @entity0 that updated plans have been put into place for @entity6 special operations forces to conduct operations against @entity2 personnel in @entity3 , if targets can be identified and located			1
all three officials declined to be identified because the information involves intelligence matters			0
the @entity6 believes the foreign fighters include @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 as well as nationals from several @entity35 countries , the officials said			2
it is believed many of these fighters have been part of the longstanding pipeline of fighters that operated in @entity28 and @entity29 and has now been diverted to @entity3 , they said			0
the estimate of 200 fighters does not include an unknown number of ethnic @entity3 who are believed to have traveled to @entity3 from @entity46 , the @entity6 and other @entity35 countries , they said			1
in assessing the threat posed by the presence of foreign fighters , one of the @entity6 military officials said the most dangerous are perhaps as many as two dozen " subject matter experts " from @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity29 , and @entity31 who are teaching bomb - making and other small arms tactics in camps across southern @entity3			1
the balance of the foreign fighters is believed to be operating with the @entity58 organization , an @entity2 affiliate group in @entity3 that is fighting the government and @entity62 peacekeepers in an effort to take control of the country			1
one official said @entity3 is now " the ultimate safe haven			1
" the official added that the @entity6 must operate on the assumption that the core group of foreign fighters are training others to conduct attacks against western targets in @entity74 , as well as training individuals to attack targets in the @entity6			1
" they have goals beyond the @entity3 border , " one official said			0
the @entity6 has observed a number of ad hoc training camps in southern @entity3 , the officials said			2
generally , they operate for no more than three months before fighters move to other locations because they know they are likely to be observed by @entity6 intelligence satellites or reconnaissance drones flying overhead , officials said			0
fighters are using existing areas like old army camps , buildings , and even cemeteries to disguise the real purpose of their activities , the officials said			0
the top @entity2 operative still being sought in @entity3 is @entity97 , long wanted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of @entity6 embassies in @entity101 and @entity102			2
he is believed to be moving between the remote border regions of @entity3 and @entity101 , the officials said			0
in september 2009 , @entity6 commandos killed @entity106 in a helicopter attack on his vehicle convoy after hunting him for years			0
@entity106 was seen as perhaps a key leader of @entity2 operations in @entity74 and , according to @entity6 officials , it is not clear who , if anyone , has taken his place .			2
