-- @entity1 was a 6 - year - old boy			1
on november 3 , he died when his mother threw him off the @entity3 in @entity4 , according to police			1
media coverage of his death has widely focused on the stresses and challenges of raising a child with autism			1
in other words , the stories are about his mother and her problems finding help , not the dead boy			1
in all cases of violent crime , but especially those involving people with disabilities and their caregivers , we need to mourn the victims , rather than explain away their deaths			1
unfortunately , whenever these terrible kinds of tragedies take place , which they do far too often , we do just the opposite			0
stories about lack of support services position children with disabilities as burdens to their families			1
they portray the crime as understandable			1
such stories perpetuate the idea that it 's better to be dead than to be disabled , that life with disability is life without meaning , and that tired , stressed , caregivers have no hope			1
no wonder , in such a narrative , the parents do such terrible things			1
the children , or at least their disabilities , become responsible for their death			0
such stories do not just erase the victims , they are also generally inaccurate			1
in fact , this kind of killing is typically driven not by a lack of services , but by a warped understanding of disability itself			1
@entity1 did not want to die			1
he liked fuzzy stuffed animals			0
he made a wish on his cupcake for his sixth birthday			0
in september , his father wrote , " @entity6 is pleased as punch			0
he lays on our laps and puts our hands together			0
last night he made the ' mmmwha ! ' sound and gave his mommy a kiss			0
then he made the same sound and pushed our faces together			0
" but in @entity87 's world , life with autism was so horrific that she allegedly felt obligated to throw her son off a bridge			1
now her defense attorneys will offer an account of intense hardship as an excuse for murder , describing a situation so brutal that it seemed a mercy for a 6 - year - old boy to die			1
the contrast between our description of @entity6 's likes , dislikes and the last few months and his mother 's vision is stark			1
such defenses play well with juries			0
in february 2010 , @entity108 forced a lethal cocktail of drugs down the throat of her 8 - year - old son			0
at trial , which concluded wednesday , the jury found her guilty only of manslaughter , convinced that she was a desperate mother			2
@entity118 's attorney said , " this was not a murder case			2
and that 's because there were extenuating and horrific circumstances			2
and , apparently the jurors got it			0
" such claims of mercy killing are not about services or support			2
@entity130 , who was convicted of attempting to kill her daughter @entity131 , had received enormous amounts of services in the state of @entity135			0
@entity136 , a physician , enrolled her daughter @entity137 in a special private school in @entity139			0
the mother of @entity142 refused additional support from the @entity144			1
the common thread is not lack of services , but the parents ' own views on disability			1
according to @entity153 , president and co-founder of the @entity155 , these killings are most commonly perpetrated by parents who have been " inculcated into an ideology in which it 's better to be dead than to be disabled			1
if they can not succeed in fixing or curing their child , their child 's life has no point			1
" these parents do not enter into this ideology accidentally			2
@entity153 criticized the huge industry dedicated to the eradication of autism through quack treatments and the belief that environmental factors such as vaccines cause the condition ( note : they do n't )			2
such false arguments perpetuate the idea that autism can be beaten through treatment ; when treatment fails , some parents turn violent			1
indeed , in the months before killing @entity142 , his mother , @entity181 , had turned to anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists such as the group @entity184 and @entity185 , the former doctor and notorious fraud			2
@entity185 criticized the medical profession for its treatment of @entity142 and advocated for access to " cures , " a campaign that continues today			0
and it 's not just these fringe groups and snake - oil salesmen perpetuating this ideology			2
@entity197 , the biggest autism awareness charity , fundraises through military language mixed with demands for pity			2
for @entity197 , a group that has been criticized for having no people with autism on its board , autism is the enemy that must be eradicated			2
for someone who sees disability the way @entity197 does , and is unable to remove the enemy , murder and suicide seem reasonable			2
autism speaks even acknowledges this line of thought			0
in 2006 , then senior executive @entity216 was widely criticized for describing , in a documentary produced by @entity197 , that she had contemplated driving off a bridge with her autistic daughter in the car			0
@entity216 has since stepped away from those remarks			0
after the film came out , she wrote , " the point i was trying to make in the film was that the lack of appropriate services and the thought of putting her in a terrible school made me want to drive off the bridge ; not that @entity230 did			0
" she has also since , " changed [ her ] behavior and rhetoric			0
" still , even if @entity216 has moved on , the rhetoric persists , and re-emerging now as @entity1 's body is pulled from the water			1
the @entity1 family may well have needed more and better services			1
there is a time for that conversation , but it is n't now			0
@entity153 says , " immediately after or in connection to an act of violence or murder against a child with a disability is the disastrously wrong time to have the conversation about services			0
" instead , it 's time to mourn another death and to work on how we talk about disability , because this story is n't about @entity87 or support			1
he liked hats and stuffed animals			0
he liked it when his parents kissed			0
now he 's dead .			0

@entity1 , a *young* boy with autism , was allegedly killed by his mother
@entity267 : in cases of crime involving person with disability , how about focus on victim ?
he says media stories convey the idea that life with disability has no meaning
@entity267 : let 's change how we talk about disability and give parents hope and support
