-- we all know the feeling of dread that washes over you when standing at the baggage carousel after a flight			0
" did my bag make it ? " in the last couple of years , another wrinkle has been added to the mix in the form of bag fees			1
in the past , if an airline lost , delayed or damaged your bag , you could get compensation			1
that 's still true today , but what about that fee you paid just for the right to check your bag ? can you get that back ? while some airlines will give you something back , the majority wo n't			2
that 's surprising to a lot of people , and it does n't really seem fair			0
are you paying just to check your bag or are you paying for it to actually get to your destination when you do ? only one airline will refund your bag fees if your bag is lost , delayed , or damaged and that 's @entity38 , with its hubs in @entity40 and @entity41			1
kudos to @entity38 for doing the right thing , but very few others will do anything at all			2
@entity46 led the way in compensating travelers when it first introduced its bag fees for the first checked bag			1
now , if you are n't reunited with your bags within 20 minutes of arriving at the gate , you 're entitled to a $ 20 discount on a future flight or 2,000 bonus miles in the airline 's frequent flier program			1
there are a couple of catches			0
this wo n't automatically get put into your account -- you 'll have to talk to someone at the airport within two hours of your arrival to get the credit			2
also , it 's only one coupon per person , regardless of how many bags were checked			0
@entity71 has also decided to do something in this arena , but it 's structured differently			0
if your bags are delayed more than 12 hours on @entity71 , and you 've paid the first and second bag fees , then you can get a credit as well			1
but on @entity71 it 's a $ 25 credit for the first bag and another $ 25 if you had a second bag			1
unfortunately , this is really the end of the line when it comes to getting something in return when your bags go missing			0
@entity84 has a bag fee refund form , as do others , but the only reasons it says it gives refunds are if there were duplicate charges , if you did n't travel or if you did n't actually check a bag			1
if your bag was delayed , it appears you are n't getting that fee back in any shape or form			1
@entity97 and @entity98 , of course , wo n't refund your money for checking that first bag , because they do n't charge a fee for those bags			2
instead , they bake the cost into the ticket price , and you are n't getting a refund for that			0
there is a little bit of relief on the horizon from the federal government , but it 's really minor at best			0
regulation soon goes into effect that will require airlines to refund bag fees but only if the bag is lost permanently			1
in other words , if your bag is simply delayed for a day or two or 10 , then this regulation does n't apply			2
it 's only if that bag is lost and gone forever			0
not much teeth to this rule			0
so what can you do ? well , if your bag is lost or delayed , you can always try contacting customer relations at the airline			2
depending upon the situation , that might be able to get you some bonus miles or a voucher , but that 's the luck of the draw .			0

@entity135 thinks travelers should receive refunds if they do n't get their luggage
@entity71 has a $ 25 to $ 50 voucher if your bags are delayed by more than 12 hours
@entity38 is one airline that refunds bag fees if your bag does n't arrive on your flight
