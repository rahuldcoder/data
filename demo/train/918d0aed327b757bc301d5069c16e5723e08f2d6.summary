-- @entity2 's @entity1 says she will consider it a grand slam if she wins next month 's @entity5			1
a day after becoming the first player since @entity8 in 1953 to win the first three majors of the season , @entity6 is not concerned by the presence of five women 's majors this year			1
" yes , of course , i think so , " sunday 's @entity15 winner told @entity16 when asked if success at the @entity5 would constitute a grand slam			1
" even though there are five majors , i think winning four is very , very good			0
" this is the first year in which there will be five majors on the schedule , after the @entity27 in @entity28 was elevated in status			2
by winning at the @entity32 course in @entity33 by four strokes , the @entity30 put herself in contention to become the first golfer -- male or female -- to win four major championships in a season			2
having won the @entity42 in april and the @entity43 earlier this month , she has already matched the record of the legendary @entity45 , who won three majors in 1950			1
when @entity45 achieved her milestone only three majors were on the schedule , while @entity49 ( 1961 ) and @entity50 ( 1986 ) are the only other players in @entity53 history to win three majors in a season -- but the latter two women failed to achieve consecutive wins			1
@entity6 , 24 , says she was well aware of the history coming her way as she drove off on sunday			0
" i felt the pressure because i was going for three in a row and everything that was going on was very crazy -- but once i got on the course , i was very calm , " she said			0
" it 's crazy what i 've just done			2
i never would have thought i would have done that ever			0
" i am achieving things i never thought i would get , but i am getting there one step at a time			0
i do n't know how far i will go			0
" winning a fifth major in the season , with the @entity27 taking place in september , would represent a milestone in the history of golf			0
although an arguably slim prospect , @entity6 's record in her last 24 starts -- with eight victories coming on top of five runner - up finishes -- suggests she is likely to be in contention at both events			0
the @entity85 - born golfer won her first major in 2008 at the @entity15 but had to wait until earlier this year to add that success			1
@entity2 have won seven of the last nine major @entity53 titles and @entity6 is hopeful she can continue that remarkable run at @entity91 in august			1
" i played very well at the @entity5 in the last couple of years so i am really looking forward to going there , " added a woman who turned professional in 2006 .			2

@entity1 believes fourth major would constitute a ' grand slam '
@entity2 has won @entity15 , @entity42 and @entity53 this year
next available title is august 's @entity5 at @entity91
