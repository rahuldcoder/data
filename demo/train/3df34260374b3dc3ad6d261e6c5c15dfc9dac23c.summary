@entity0 -- a small @entity3 town may soon require every household to own a firearm -- a law that , if passed , would make it the second town in the state to mandate gun ownership			1
city council members in @entity11 , a town of 1,300 people north of @entity0 , unanimously approved the proposal at a meeting this week			1
citizens now have a chance to review the proposal before the council takes it up again in april			1
" basically this is a deterrent ordinance , " councilman @entity19 said at the meeting			1
" it 's no more than putting a sign in your front yard saying that ' @entity26 protects this home			0
' now the person that may be there ( checking ) your home out to cause harm to you or your family to break into your house has to decide , ' when i break that door down , what 's on the other side of that door ? ' " the law would give every family the right to protect themselves and their property " without worrying about prosecution for protecting themselves , " @entity19 told the meeting			0
he said the proposal was modeled on a similar law in nearby @entity51 , @entity3 , that has been on the books since 1982			0
@entity11 police chief @entity53 told council members the proposal is a great idea			1
" i think y'all are showing the people that you 're in full support of the @entity61 , " @entity53 said			2
" and as far as the @entity63 goes , that you stand behind it , you stand behind people 's rights			2
" the two - paragraph proposal reads , " in order to provide for the emergency management of the city , and further in order to provide for and protect the safety , security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants , every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm , together with ammunition therefore			0
" people with physical or mental disabilities are exempt from the law , as are " paupers , " felons , and those who oppose gun ownership based on belief or religious doctrine			0
