-- @entity1 , the only candidate currently standing against @entity3 president @entity2 , is resolutely refusing to take the gloves off against his rival in the race to decide who will lead football 's world governing body			1
given the criticism @entity2 and his organization has faced over its governance in recent years some might argue @entity14 has been presented with a virtual own goal for his campaign -- but not a bit of it			2
" @entity2 is not corrupt , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity19			1
" i 'm not here to defend @entity2 but i want him to be a responsible candidate and an efficient president			2
" @entity24 's @entity23 chairman @entity22 recently described a @entity3 meeting as " like something out of @entity33 " in which the organization 's federations adopted an attitude to @entity2 of " hail to the leader			1
" but @entity1 rejected the idea that @entity2 ruthlessly controls things from the top , rather seeing the man who has been at @entity3 's helm for the past 16 years as akin to the leader of a democratically elected head of state			1
" the @entity3 president , according to the constitution of @entity3 , he 's not a dictator , said @entity1			1
" i give you an example			0
in the @entity47 , which is a democracy , @entity47 people vote for the prime minister			0
when the prime minister is elected , he or she has a right to set up a cabinet in order to implement the program that he or she has been elected for			0
" that 's democracy and of course he or she will be controlled by the @entity62 , by the house			0
you think the @entity3 president can choose the government to implement the program he has been elected for the 209 federations ? not at all			1
" while describing the 78 - year - old @entity2 as someone " who is married with football , " @entity1 insisted the organization needed " fresh air			1
" the 56 - year - old former @entity3 insider added : " the issue is not the person , it 's the program , it 's the vision			1
it 's what we do with the tools , with the administration , " he says			0
" i 'm not happy with the situation of @entity3 and i 'm not happy with the situation of football			2
i think football is an amazing tool and fifa can be an amazing machine to have a model of world governance			0
" that 's why i decided to run			0
it 's about taking risks			0
if you do n't take risks in your life nothing will happen			0
" the @entity96 's insistence on playing the ball and not the man may have something to do with his former life as a diplomat , but equally it may be informed by an intimate knowledge of how the @entity105 - based organization operates			0
the 56 - year - old spent 11 years with @entity3 employing his diplomatic skills in the footballing arena as director of international relations from 1999 to 2010			1
during his time there , @entity1 worked closely with @entity2 , tasked with overseeing improvements in relations with national associations and other international sporting bodies including the @entity117			1
after being relieved of his duties at @entity3 at the beginning of 2010 for reasons never fully explained , @entity1 set up as an independent consultant advising a number of clubs and associations including the @entity125 and the @entity126			1
the relationship with the latter has focused on establishing a professional league in the state as well promoting better relations with @entity132 's @entity23 and @entity133			0
however , given @entity14 's previous close links with @entity2 's controversial stewardship , can the @entity96 be trusted to deliver sweeping reforms ? " i hope , i believe i can and also i believe we need ( it ) , " he insists			0
" i do n't mind when people are telling me : ' you worked with @entity2 , how can you be the face of change ? ' " @entity142 , we can debate that and i can show what i have done when i was there ... so listen , it 's part of democracy and that 's why i decided to stand			2
" last week , @entity2 tweeted that @entity3 was taking the lead in acting " ethically , " despite the organization facing criticism over the the bidding process for the 2018 and @entity153			1
@entity1 's enthusiasm to expose his own record to public scrutiny is something that @entity3 should be doing with @entity160 lawyer @entity159 's report into that bidding process , the @entity96 argues			1
@entity3 wants to keep the report private , but @entity159 , who passed his report to @entity3 's ethics chief @entity163 earlier this month , says it should be made public			1
" we need to know what happened , " said @entity1			0
" a judicial process which is open where the citizen can buy the process , can be part of the process knowing why a person is indicted and the person is innocent or guilty			0
" it 's very important and i think the release of the report is very important because it will be a part of the rebuilding of the image of @entity3 because it 's definitely needed			2
" @entity3 members will elect a new president in may 2015			2
