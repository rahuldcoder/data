-- @entity1 is caught up in a student cheating scandal that its dean of undergraduate education calls " unprecedented in its scope and magnitude			1
" as a @entity1 grad , i am embarrassed , but what has me really worried is that @entity1 , despite officials acknowledging the seriousness of what has happened , gives signs of trying to finesse the consequences of the scandal where key athletes are concerned			1
the scandal centers on 125 students , as many as half of them varsity athletes from the men 's basketball , baseball and football teams , according to the @entity24			1
they stand accused of copying from one another or plagiarizing on a take - home exam in a spring 2012 government course , " introduction to @entity31 , " with an enrollment of 279			0
at @entity1 the standard penalty for cheating is that a student can be asked to withdraw from the university for a year			1
in the case of athletes , withdrawal means the loss of a year of athletic eligibility , according to the @entity41 , if they are forced to leave after they have registered for classes			1
@entity1 is seeking to avoid that problem			2
the secretary of @entity1 's @entity46 , the body that rules on individual cheating cases , sent around an internal e-mail to resident deans saying that fall athletes might " consider taking [ a leave of absence ] before their first game			1
" the internal e-mail , obtained by @entity56 , @entity1 's student paper , and confirmed by a resident dean , sends a clear message			2
you may be guilty of cheating , but here is a strategy for reducing the damage you suffer to a year 's unpaid vacation			2
this advice may be @entity1 's idea of academic integrity , but it certainly falls short of what a university should aim for			2
fortunately , there is an example @entity1 might learn from -- that of @entity74 , which in 1951 experienced a massive cheating scandal that involved a disproportionate number of athletes			1
on august 3 that year , @entity74 announced that it was expelling 90 cadets , including the son of its legendary football coach , @entity80 , for cheating on their exams by passing along answers			1
the @entity74 honor code is clear			2
it says , " a cadet will not lie , cheat , or steal , or tolerate those who do it , " and @entity74 authorities upheld their honor code despite the consequences			2
news : allegations of widespread cheating in government class probed at @entity1 @entity97 authorities did not try , as @entity1 already has , to figure out a way to follow the letter of the law but make sure there was minimal damage to its athletic program			1
when fall football practice opened in 1951 , @entity104 , a national powerhouse in 1950 , was able to muster a squad that included only 31 players ; just two of whom were lettermen			0
" i guess we can take a losing season , " @entity80 told the media			0
that is exactly what happened			0
@entity104 , which in 1950 was ranked no. 2 in the nation , became a losing team in 1951 , winning only two games while dropping seven			0
it became a team nobody feared , losing to @entity120 by 35 points in its final game of the season			0
maj. gen. @entity127 , the superintendent of @entity74 , did not back away from the academy 's decision to expel the 90 cadets caught cheating			1
" the man who cheats at @entity74 cheats every man who will graduate with him , " @entity127 told those who complained he was acting too harshly			0
at @entity74 the origins of the cheating scandal were traced to a small group of football players , and at @entity1 the most noteworthy early withdrawals from the school are those of the senior co-captains on the basketball team , which in recent years has been faced with troubling questions about its players and coach			1
last season , after decades of fielding mediocre basketball teams , @entity1 was ranked among the nation 's top 25 in basketball , and at the heart of the basketball team 's success was a program dogged by controversy ever since @entity1 hired former @entity154 coach @entity153 in april 2007			1
getting @entity153 to come to @entity1 was not easy			0
it required the friends of @entity156 , an alumni group dominated by ex-players			0
chipping in money to improve @entity160 's salary , with , the @entity161 reported , the full knowledge of @entity1 's athletic director			2
@entity153 then got himself into hot water by recruiting players with lower academic profiles than his predecessor had recruited			0
he was investigated for a possible violation of @entity41 rules for allowing a coach , whom he would later hire as his assistant , to work out with a player @entity1 was trying to recruit			2
a five - month @entity175 investigation into @entity160 's recruiting practices cleared him of wrongdoing , but the tone was set for a sports program based on cutting corners and winning at all costs			0
before the 2008 season began , @entity153 called in five players the previous coach had recruited and told them there were no spots for them on the varsity team			0
their basketball careers at @entity1 were finished			2
the ball is in the court of @entity1 president @entity191 to deal with the basketball program and the cheating scandal			1
the author of the widely praised history , " @entity196 : death and the @entity206 , " @entity191 has been a welcome change from her predecessor , @entity198 , @entity200 's secretary of the treasury and for two years director of the @entity202 in the @entity204 administration			0
in contrast to @entity198 , who constantly alienated faculty with his imperious ways , @entity191 has carefully built consensus			0
as a result , everyone connected with @entity1 gave her enormous leeway in her decision - making			0
now , @entity191 's period of grace is over , thanks to the national publicity surrounding the cheating scandal			1
the future of an ethics - skirting basketball program is in the spotlight , and so are the teaching practices that led massive numbers of students to cheat in a course many originally took because it had a reputation for being easy			1
@entity230 , who has said the accusations of cheating " go to the core of what is most valuable to us , " will show the backbone that maj. gen. @entity127 did 61 years ago is an open question			0
but the least she can do is set the bar higher than @entity1 's secretary of the administrative board did by advising the university 's athletes how to beat the system by minimizing the consequences of their cheating			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			0
