and sober brothers at every event , guarding the stairs and with key access to each room			1
those are some of the rules that fraternities will have to abide by if they want to throw a party , the @entity9 says			1
@entity9 shut down @entity14 social life on november 21 , two days after the publication of a now - discredited @entity17 article about an alleged gang rape in a fraternity house on the @entity21 campus			1
the article 's credibility aside , the university acknowledged this week that it needs to evaluate a broader problem , and said the @entity14 life " pause " was intended to allow leadership to work on improving safety at fraternity and sorority events			1
reinstatement comes with a stipulation that each @entity14 organization agree by january 16 to new rules -- devised by @entity9 's @entity14 leadership councils -- for university social events			1
among them are requirements that at least three members of a fraternity be " sober and lucid " at each fraternity function , and at least one of the " sober brothers " have key access to every room in the fraternity house during the party , according to the document			1
also , pre-mixed drinks or punches are prohibited from fraternity parties			1
beer and wine must be opened and " poured visibly at the bar by a sober brother			1
" and security officers must be hired to monitor the entrance at parties where there are fewer fraternity members than nonmembers			2
" i believe the new safety measures recommended by the student leaders in the @entity14 community will help provide a safer environment for their members and guests , " @entity9 president @entity62 said in a press release			1
accusations and contradictions " a rape on campus , " the 9,000 - word article by @entity73 in the november 19 issue of @entity17 , initially garnered widespread , mostly sympathetic media attention			2
in the article , a woman identified only as @entity80 , claims that she was brutally raped by seven men at the @entity83 fraternity house , while two more gave encouragement , during a party on september 28 , 2012 , while she was a freshman			1
within days , critics began to question some of the story 's details , as well as @entity17 's decision not to contact the alleged attackers			2
the @entity91 , @entity0 and other news outlets followed up , identifying a number of contradictions and discrepancies			2
two of @entity80 's friends told @entity0 that numerous details of the alleged attack as related by @entity17 were entirely different from what @entity80 told them that night			0
and they said that , while it seemed clear that she had been traumatized , they saw no injuries consistent with an attack as vicious as the article describes			0
nonetheless , one of the two friends said , he " did n't have any doubts " that the version she told him at the time was true			0
@entity83 said that the man @entity80 claimed had lured her to a dark room was never a member			0
it also cited records showing it did not have a party on the night in question , and said its house does n't have a side staircase -- important because @entity80 described descending such a staircase as she left , bloodied and broken			2
" it 's not part of our culture			0
it 's just not true , " said the fraternity 's attorney , @entity127			0
on december 5 , the magazine published an editor 's note that said " we apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening " in late 2012 when the alleged attack occurred			0
the magazine admitted that @entity73 had not contacted the man who @entity80 claimed orchestrated the alleged attack , nor did she contact any of the men she said were participants , fearing that they would retaliate against her			0
in an article detailing the key contradictions , the @entity91 reported that it had interviewed @entity80 and that she stood by her story			0
the @entity91 article came out the same day as the @entity17 editor 's note			0
police are continuing to investigate the allegations , and a state investigation of @entity9 's treatment of sexual assault allegations is ongoing			1
students return from winter break this week , and classes begin monday for the spring semester			0
@entity0 's @entity154 contributed to this report .			0

new safety measures have been imposed on fraternities and sororities at the @entity9
fraternities must designate " sober brothers " at every party and can not serve pre-mixed drinks
