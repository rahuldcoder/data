we 've yet to hear all the details surrounding @entity0 's alleged altercation with @entity4 , but it would seem in the court of public opinion , @entity0 's already been tried			1
if you 've been following your celebrity feuds , you know there was tension between @entity0 and @entity12 in 2011 thanks to an argument on @entity15			1
but with @entity0 's history of violent behavior and the examples of questionable decision - making in recent years , the presumption by some is that the " @entity23 " singer is the guilty party in the standoff			1
as with controversial celebrities before him , at the core of the reaction to @entity0 are those age - old questions : what are our behavior standards for our celebrities , who sets them , and can they be enforced ? if someone does something heinous , should we cease to find them entertaining ? and just how much should a star 's personal life override his or her work ? the answers to those questions are debatable and shift with the times , but they 're also made all the more charged by the context of @entity0 's case			1
following his 2009 assault on his then - girlfriend @entity47 , which the world saw through a leaked photo of the singer 's bruised and beaten face and a detailed police report , @entity0 has developed a reputation to rival showbiz 's biggest repeat offenders			1
in the past four years , he 's created a baffling rinse - and - repeat history of misdeeds , with a few apologies to match			1
just within the last seven months , the r&b / hip - hop artist has been in two other highly publicized fights -- one physical , with fellow musician @entity63 in @entity64 , and one digital , with writer / comedian @entity66 on @entity15 -- in addition to now being investigated for the third brawl over the weekend			2
@entity69 has n't heard back from either @entity0 or @entity12 for more clarification on what transpired in the 7200 block of @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 , but authorities have confirmed that it was a physical throwdown involving six men			1
as deputies work to get to the bottom of what occurred , they 've said that @entity0 is under investigation for allegedly punching an unnamed victim -- and over a parking space , no less			2
yet the frequent feuds are just the beginning of @entity0 's tenuous public image			1
equally damaging has been his defensive attitude , a brash , short - sighted bravado that he 'll sometimes temper with notes of aspirational positivity			0
the highlight reel of 2012 alone gives enough examples : last february , he won no favors by telling those opposed to his 2012 grammy awards appearance to " hate " all they wanted to , because he 'd won an award that night			0
( that , in his opinion , was the " ultimate f * * * off			0
" ) in october , @entity0 incurred skeptical looks with a @entity105 costume that was perceived as emulating the stereotypical image of a terrorist			2
the month prior to that the controversy was a tattoo of a " sugar skull " on his neck , one that made enough people think of a post-assault @entity47 that his rep had to clarify that the ink was n't of the pop star			0
in december , he again rankled onlookers by sharing a photo of himself in @entity121 smoking enough " medicinal marijuana " for three people , which he later apologized for			0
( perhaps realizing the pot - stirring effect his social media posts have , @entity0 pulled away from @entity127 on tuesday with the post : " social media takes away the essence of why we are even special or icons			1
so with that , i 'm detaching myself from that world			0
" ) as a result , any conversation that remotely mentions the 23 - year - old star tends to push observers into two camps			0
there are the defending supporters , who accuse @entity0 's critics of being self - righteous and coldly disbelieving in an individual 's power to change			1
and then there are the affronted , who see his defenders as dismissive of @entity0 's influence and unwilling to hold the singer accountable for his actions -- not to mention turning a blind eye to the gravity of domestic violence			1
the media are n't above taking sides			0
@entity156 of @entity157 offered a " preponderance of evidence " that @entity0 is " one of the most infuriatingly awful people in show business			2
" @entity162 posited that " it 's not hard to choose between those two versions " in the @entity12 / @entity0 fracas , because in one corner you have " a violent , angry , abusive a * * hole , " and in the other , a singer who " has never been accused of assault and is n't known for hitting people			1
" influential supporters like @entity173 -- who recently told @entity175 magazine that he 's pulling for the @entity177 / hip - hop singer on @entity178 night -- chime in , reminding consumers that it 's about a product , not a personality			2
" i 'm a fan , " @entity173 said of @entity0			2
" his music is really good			0
that 's what they should focus on : the music			0
" it might be tough to remember , but @entity0 caught our attention in 2005 with the promise of becoming pop 's next prince , earning the distinction at the time of being the first male artist in over a decade to land a no. 1 on the @entity175 100 with a debut single			1
he was top 40 radio - ready and appearing in @entity199 gum commercials , singing alongside an " @entity201 " winner and charmingly chatting about wanting to be the next @entity202			0
along the way , he 's developed a strong fan base -- sometimes referred to as @entity205 -- that 's been consistent in his corner even as we 've watched that careful artist package come apart at the seams			0
one thing that 's held his ship upright in waves of backlash , said @entity216 senior editor @entity215 , has been his music			0
" it does help when you have really good products in the marketplace , because i think at the end of the day that will supersede everything , " @entity66 said			0
" you 're trying to repair a damaged image , one way to shift the focus is to put out good music			0
" whether you personally find @entity0 's music to be " good " or not is a matter of taste , but it is clear that he 's being accepted by both the industry and the music - buying public			1
the same month he allegedly broke the window of his " @entity238 " dressing room after storming off the set , he notched his first no. 1 album on the @entity175 with 2011 's " @entity240 " that same record also earned @entity0 a best @entity242 the following february , and his 2012 album , " @entity244 , " was another no. 1 and is nominated in the best urban contemporary category at the 2013 ceremony			1
@entity0 is far from the first to whip us into a backbiting frenzy over where we , culturally , can and / or should draw our lines , and it 's seriously unlikely he 'll be the last			1
@entity252 is one of the most notorious examples , and while he 's a touchy subject when it comes to public acceptance , he 's nonetheless been successful in terms of output			0
even before he was " winning , " @entity252 cultivated a bad - boy reputation thanks to his predilection for paying for " sexual services " and time spent in rehab			0
in the mid-to - late ' 90s , his shine further lost its luster with allegations of domestic violence			2
in 2009 , @entity252 's then - wife @entity268 alleged that he threatened her , a storyline that was the precursor to his at turns confusing , laughable and upsetting meltdown in 2011 , during which he was let go from the popular show " @entity272			2
" after coming down off the tiger blood , @entity252 's now on @entity274 with another comedy , " @entity276			0
" in @entity0 's case , he 's similarly continued to press forward with his music and acting career			1
prior to making his @entity127 account private , he posted that he 's at work on a new album , showing once again that what happens for a star personally does n't always interrupt what occurs professionally , even while we continue to hash out whether it should .			2

although details are n't clear , some have assumed @entity0 is guilty in his latest fight
the presumptions are *attributed* to his history of violence
@entity0 's *trajectory* raises age - old questions surrounding celebrity and accountability
