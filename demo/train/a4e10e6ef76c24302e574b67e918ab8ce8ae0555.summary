@entity1 , @entity2 the @entity0 have long been home to some of @entity7 's most remote villages			1
until a decade ago , running water and electricity were nearly unheard of , and even today are considered luxuries in most of the mountain towns			1

" our grandmothers were making carpets before us			1
the best carpets in the world can be found in @entity2			2
it 's an art , " says @entity30 , a local carpet weaver			2
