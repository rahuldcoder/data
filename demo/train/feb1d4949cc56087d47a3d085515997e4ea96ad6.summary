@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 recently visited @entity5 , @entity1 , for the first time			1
residents of northern @entity9 , the couple took part in the june 29 candlelight procession honoring massacre victims at @entity0			1
@entity4 , an author , teacher and civil rights lawyer , describes how the experience allowed him a rare glimpse inside the " real @entity5 , " not the storybook one depicted in the movies			1
a former schoolteacher , @entity3 was reminded of the injustices she witnessed in her native @entity20 during @entity21 here is an edited transcript of their interview			1
and read the full story of @entity0			1
what was your experience participating in the @entity0 procession ? @entity4 : i realized that we were the only two people who were n't from @entity1 or @entity34			1
it was like we were representing the whole rest of the world			1
i remember just before night fell there was a beautiful sunset			1
the whole sky was just ablaze			1
it made me wonder what it was like in 1944 on that date and whether the sky was as beautiful as that			1
i thought of what the people must have gone through because they thought they were out of the way			1
but all of a sudden they had these tanks and soldiers coming in and gathering all the men up and killing them			1
and it was such a contradiction between what we 're looking at and what must have happened on that date			1
that really stayed with me			1
@entity60 : i felt very sad to hear what was going on			1
i was really very , very sad			1
they were just a delightful group of people really			1
and i thought : " oh my gosh , that 's terrible			1
why [ did ] this happen to them in 1944 ? " i know about the history of the @entity69 , but i did n't know about that town and what they did			2
do you remember something from the evening that affected you ? @entity76 : i did n't feel , or sense , any bitterness or hate			2
that struck me very strongly			2
they were just there to remember and not to hate			2
when everything was over , we went to this little club that sits in the back of the village			2
some of the older guys were out in the front , chatting and smoking and having a beer or wine			2
and we went in and got something to drink			2
they knew that we could n't really speak @entity93			2
we could just say hello			2
but there were a feeling of acceptance of " thank you for being here			2
" what was your family 's experience during @entity21 ? @entity76 : i had grown up in @entity103 , @entity104			2
my grandmother and my aunt were the ones who were raising me during the war years			2
my mother had gone off to @entity111 , @entity9 to work			2
in fact , she worked in a parachute assembly plant			2
i lived mostly with my grandmother and she had five boys			0
four of them went into the service during the war years			0
you know how they put stars on the windows when you had somebody in service ? she had four stars in her front window			0
i did n't realize all this until i was much older and then i started to ask questions			0
so i knew the kind of sacrifices my grandmother had gone through			0
i do n't think i really had experienced first - hand the kind of feeling that i felt at @entity0 and saw the place where the men had been killed and there were still some bullet holes in the wall			1
that gave me a whole different sense of what the war must have been like to people who were otherwise innocent , and just waiting and hoping that it would be over and pass them by			0
@entity146 : i was sitting with my parents in @entity20 , @entity148 and the @entity149 were coming by our house to go to the @entity152 to kill them			0
and we told them : " no , no we do n't have them			0
" we were lying so that they would leave			0
that 's what my father was doing			0
i did n't know what was going on but i was listening and they said : " be quiet			0
" so they were going into the houses -- they were all empty -- and they started shooting			0
they stole all their clothes , all their furniture			0
they were very proud to be with @entity170			0
my dad was very worried about the beautiful neighbors , the @entity152 neighbors we had			1
how did the experience change your opinion of @entity5 ? @entity76 : i had a romanticized idea about @entity5 : a lot of vineyards and people drinking wine out on their patios			0
i think it 's still a romantic place			0
it 's a very human place			0
what i learned from @entity0 was that people suffered			1
and there was a very difficult history			0
to recollect the way they do it is really beautiful			1
it left me feeling very happy to have experienced those moments with them			1
we saw another side of the @entity93 people that not many people see			0
that was really a humbling experience			0
@entity146 : for me , @entity5 is great			0
when i finished seeing that beautiful little town , it 's great			1
it did n't affect me negatively			0
i was sad for them , but it was so delightful			0
i was impressed by the children and the grandmothers because they were sitting and talking while the children were laughing , running and playing			1
what thought would you like to leave us with ? @entity76 : we honor the soldiers -- the warriors -- the men and women that fought for us and died for us to keep our freedom alive			0
but we often forget the people , the mothers and fathers , the families that were behind them , waiting for them to come back			0
so we have to remember the people who sacrificed on the battlefield , but also those who sacrificed at home			0
and certainly , @entity0 gives us an example of the tremendous sacrifice of people who were otherwise innocent			1
it just reinforces my conviction that we can not use war as an option in working out our problems .			0

couple who attended @entity0 memorial share their feelings
@entity4 : to recollect the way they do it is really beautiful
@entity60 : the children were laughing , running and playing . they were very happy .
