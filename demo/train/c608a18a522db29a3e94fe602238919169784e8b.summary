@entity0 -- the day before @entity2 makes a highly publicized trip to @entity4 , president @entity5 on friday signed a bill passed by @entity7 designed to increase security ties with the jewish state			1
both the timing of friday 's event and the presence of tv cameras opened the @entity14 to accusations of political maneuvering in a presidential election year			1
@entity5 's schedule for this week , distributed by the @entity14 on july 20 , made no mention of the signing of the @entity22 - @entity4 @entity21			1
the measure won final approval from @entity7 on july 17 , receiving strong bipartisan support			0
@entity14 spokesman @entity26 denied any political intent with the timing of the bill signing , saying the measure passed last week and @entity5 was traveling from sunday to wednesday			2
" the president 's been on the road , and today was the day to sign it , " he said friday			0
@entity2 , the certain @entity34 presidential nominee , hammered @entity5 's @entity36 policy in a recent speech to a @entity39 convention			2
in particular , he accused @entity5 of failing to fully support @entity4 , an accusation the @entity14 strongly denies			0
in signing the measure friday , @entity5 spoke of the " unshakeable commitment " of his government to @entity4 's security and announced a previously authorized $ 70 million in @entity22 funding for @entity4 's @entity47 missile defense system			1
@entity26 said @entity5 directed the @entity47 funding in may and the money was transferred " in recent days , " leading to the announcement friday in conjunction with the signing of the bill			1
" this is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for @entity4 families , " @entity5 said of the @entity47 system			1
" it is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of @entity4			0
and it is testimony of the leadership of folks sitting here that we are going to be able to lock in that funding to make sure that program continues and that we are standing by our friends in @entity4 when it comes to these kinds of attacks			0
" he also announced that defense secretary @entity74 would travel to @entity4 soon to discuss additional ways the two nations can cooperate on defense and security issues			0
a @entity14 document issued after the event emphasized the steps @entity5 has taken as president in support of @entity4 to emphasize his commitment to @entity4 's security			1
@entity5 easily won the @entity87 vote in 2008 , but his sometimes strained relations with @entity4 prime minister @entity89 have raised concerns among @entity91			0
the act @entity5 signed friday reaffirms " unwavering commitment to the security of the @entity4 as a jewish state " and calls for providing @entity4 with " the military capabilities necessary to deter and defend itself against any threat or possible combination of threats			2
" it also pledges a @entity22 veto of " any one - sided @entity104 resolutions at the @entity106 @entity105 " and outlines @entity22 support for an expanded @entity4 role in @entity109 , increased intelligence cooperation and increased training for @entity4 's air force			1
the event reinforced the @entity5 administration 's support for strong ties with @entity4 as his @entity34 rival prepares to meet with @entity89 and other @entity4 leaders in a visit that begins saturday			1
such preempting of messages and events is a time - tested trick of campaign politics			0
for example , @entity2 's campaign has scheduled regular conference calls with reporters and events with surrogates on the same day , and often in the same city , as @entity5 campaign events			2
at the signing , @entity5 was flanked by the two @entity135 @entity134 who were sponsors -- sen. @entity137 and rep. @entity138 -- as well as top figures of @entity141 organizations			0
@entity1 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0

the measure enhances security ties between the two allies
@entity5 also announces @entity22 funding for @entity4 's @entity47 missile defense system
@entity2 travels to @entity4 on saturday to meet with leaders there
@entity134 sponsors of the bill deny any political *mischief* in the timing of friday 's event
