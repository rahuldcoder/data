-- the horrific new report accusing @entity3 's embattled regime of torturing and killing thousands of detainees in government custody may not be a game - changer for the peace talks set to open in @entity8 on wednesday , but they may well shift the narrative -- if only for a day			1
@entity3 president @entity11 has played some powerful cards ahead of the @entity14 2 talks			1
he has cranked up the airstrikes in @entity16 , @entity3 's biggest city and one of the main flashpoints of the three - year civil war that has devastated the country			2
and he sent foreign minister @entity21 to @entity22 last week to announce a cease - fire proposal in an attempt to set the stage for opposition groups to look bad if they do n't agree to the deal			0
but when @entity3 officials step in front of the cameras in @entity8 this week , the questions wo n't be about ceasefire deals			2
they 'll be about the report , first revealed by @entity0 and the @entity35 in an exclusive on monday , alleging systematic " crimes against humanity " being committed against prisoners in @entity3 jails			1
4 things to know about @entity3 there may be moments of discomfort for foreign minister @entity21 here , but they 'll be fleeting ones			2
it would be quite normal for the @entity3 to question the authenticity of the photos depicting torture and starvation of prisoners , to brush the issue aside or shift the focus to the atrocities they claim have been committed by rebels ( or " terrorists , " as they 're known in government parlance )			1
we certainly wo n't see the @entity11 regime admitting culpability over this			2
and while the timing of the report 's release clearly seems intended to push some much - needed wind into the sails of the groups opposed to @entity11 , it 's hard to see how they 'll benefit much from the new revelations			1
organizationally , the opposition is a mess			2
several of the largest groups , including the @entity77 , are n't even showing up to the talks			0
rival rebel factions are massacring each other by the hundreds in the streets and alleys of cities across @entity3			0
even worse , none of the politicians who make up the majority of the @entity88 - backed @entity3 opposition are in the country , so they are n't in control of the military forces battling @entity11 's troops on the ground			1
the @entity94 said they hope a few rebel army leaders show up to the talks , but again , who are they and what weight do they actually carry ? the principal rebel commander the @entity102 was backing , @entity100 general @entity99 , fled the country in december			0
the influence of the group is being increasingly diminished by @entity106 and @entity108 - backed militants who the @entity102 does not support			0
all in all , no one is expecting any major breakthroughs during one day of talks			1
@entity102 secretary of state @entity112 , who will attend the first day of talks in @entity114 before they move to @entity14 over the weekend , has said in the past that negotiations to end the @entity119 war took years			0
the best case scenario for these talks is more talks -- and that none of the parties get up and storm out			0
in terms of negotiations , when will we see some substantial compromises ? @entity11 recently told reporters that we 're still months away from him announcing a date for planned 2014 national elections			0
it seems increasingly likely that @entity11 will again run for president			0
but there 's always the possibility that he could use the ongoing war to postpone elections altogether			0
let 's face it : how could you really hold elections when eight million people are displaced in @entity3 ? the regime would control the balloting and accounting processes : who would provide security ? it would be crazy to think international monitors could reliably observe national polls with a full - blown war happening all around them			1
if -- and probably when -- @entity11 won an election , it is clear the opposition would simply continue to refuse to recognize him as the legitimate leader of @entity3			1
but until the yet - to - be announced date for a poll approaches , we are n't going to get to a decisive moment in peace talks			2
it 's too early to say , and we 're still so far away from any compromise points			0
exclusive : gruesome @entity3 photos may prove torture by @entity11 regime @entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			1

the new report accusing @entity11 's regime of torture may shift the focus of the peace talks
@entity3 may question the authenticity of the photos , writes @entity0 's @entity177
organizationally , the @entity3 opposition is a mess , he says
