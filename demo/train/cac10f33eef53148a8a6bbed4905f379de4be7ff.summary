-- first , there was the war on drugs			1
then came the war on terrorism			0
followed by the war on @entity7 , women and religion			0
we seem to love waging wars			0
and now a new war has broken out : the war on comedy			1
this war started just a week ago by those defending @entity18 's infamous attack on @entity19 , a @entity20 law school student who simply offered an opinion @entity18 did n't like			1
so , @entity18 being the " entertainer " that he is , responded by calling this young woman a " slut " and " prostitute			2
" with @entity18 under attack for his despicable comments , his supporters launched a desperate counterattack to save him by targeting " liberal " comedians like @entity31 and @entity32 for their crude and demeaning jokes about @entity35			1
their point was that @entity18 may have been bad , but he 's not the only one , so he should be forgiven			1
( i 'd love to see a defendant in a murder trial try this defense			0
) thus , the war on comedy was on			2
the hostilities escalated late last week when @entity45 ' @entity44 called for a boycott of the @entity48 ' dinner because @entity32 was slated to host the event			0
( @entity32 dropped out of hosting the dinner shortly after the controversy erupted			0
) i 'm not really sure why @entity18 's defenders launched this war on comedians			1
@entity18 does not even consider himself a comedian ; instead , he 's referred to as an " entertainer , " which is the same label often used to describe strippers			2
( no offense intended to strippers			0
) in any event , @entity31 and @entity32 were under attack for having crossed the line that comedians are forbidden to transgress			1
so , here is the big question : what exactly is the line that comedians are prohibited from breaching ? what type of joke crosses from killing the crowd to killing your career ? to me , the answer depends on two factors			1
are you a famous comedian ? and what type of joke is it ? if you 're not a famous comic , you can get away with saying almost anything			0
i perform regularly in the comedy clubs in @entity84 which feature -- in my opinion -- the top comedians in the nation			2
but still , night after night you will hear material far worse than anything @entity31 , @entity32 or even " the entertainer " @entity18 would have articulated			1
there 's no shortage of jokes that are anti-everyone , including anti-women , anti-gay , anti-minority , anti-overweight people , etc. in a comedy club setting , it 's very easy as a comedian to determine if you went too far			2
the audience stops laughing , or at least the laughs drop off considerably			0
the comic then moves on to the next joke and that is the end of it			0
on the other hand , if you 're a famous comedian , it 's a completely different story			0
if you tell an anti- " fill in the blank " joke , you might find yourself on @entity109 , hiring a team of publicists , and making the rounds on television shows offering your " sincerest apologies			0
" opinion : democrats should reject @entity31 's money but to me , the more important factor in determining if a comedian -- famous or not -- has crossed the line of decency is to look at the subject matter of the joke			1
while i absolutely support freedom of speech , comedians deserve to suffer consequences if they make hateful jokes about race , ethnicity , gender , religion or sexual orientation			1
however , comedians must be afforded great leeway when the joke is about a political issue			2
lampooning people in power like our president , @entity142 and political candidates is nearly a cornerstone to our democracy			0
even our libel laws provide a higher degree of protection for private citizens than for public figures			0
@entity152 comedians have a proud tradition of raising awareness on important political and social issues			2
@entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and , of course , @entity161 , do more than simply make people laugh -- their comedy can shape public opinion			2
the standard for acceptable political comedy can not be whether the joke offended someone			1
political jokes will always offend someone since they are inherently divisive			2
the reason we tell these jokes is not only to get a laugh , but also to challenge people 's views			0
( here 's a little secret : we comedians enjoy the fact we sometimes rankle those in the audience who disagree with our political jokes			1
) political comedians must be afforded the unfettered right to satirize our politicians -- even if their jokes include crude words such as the ones that @entity31 and @entity32 used about @entity35 , who is still considered a leader in the @entity191 even if she is no longer the governor of @entity192			1
if we stifle political comedy , we will cause a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas on political issues			1
we will not only have lost the war on comedy , but also effectively silenced comedians from telling jokes about any controversial political topics or figures			1
this would result in two equally dire scenarios for our nation : less freedom of expression and more prop comedy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			0

@entity212 : a new war has broken out -- a war on comedy
he says the war started when @entity18 's defenders attacked @entity31
@entity212 : so what exactly is the line that comedians are prohibited from breaching ?
he says political comedy must not be stifled ; hateful jokes are a *problem*
