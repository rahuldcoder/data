-- enough already about " @entity1 " -- there were plenty of great console video games in 2011			1
many longtime franchises put bows on storylines that had been going on for years			1
it was also the year of the shooter ( and the number 3 ) as " @entity11 , " " @entity12 " and " call of duty : @entity17 " brought players into combat zones with new and creative gameplay			1
those titles got lots of hype and sold millions of units , but none made my list of the top games of the year			1
as with any top 10 list , many good games did not make the cut			1
i tried to include games that i never really wanted to put down until the very last scene			1
of course , your list will vary			1
here 's my list , counted down in order , of my 10 favorite games of 2011 ( feel free to disagree in the comments ) : 10			1
" @entity37 : @entity38 " a fitting finale for @entity40 and his adventures , " uncharted 3 : @entity38 " wraps up the historical adventure franchise with possibly his greatest treasure yet			1
not only does the story take a look back and reveal how @entity40 got started on his quests , but it also tied up many loose plot lines very well			1
the game feels like an @entity51 adventure , and @entity40 keeps a wry sense of humor throughout the most trying times			1
the designers did their research to showcase several incredible environments , historical references and lost treasures			2
players will come away feeling like they 've been on a grand adventure , which they have			2
" @entity63 " " @entity63 " puts the story to the forefront in a daring attempt to be different			1
action is dictated by the narrative and the characters and not by a ploy to get the plot moving			2
it looks and feels like a 1940s - style detective thriller with some great voice acting and motion capture animation			1
it emphasizes storytelling without forcing dialogue or plot			2
expect to see more games like this in the future			1
( @entity62 , @entity83 , @entity84 ) 8			2
" @entity85 " @entity86 returned and actually got better			1
" @entity85 " has a single - player story that has a good plot and supporting characters			1
there is actual dialogue instead of grunting or mumbles			2
the puzzle solving remains fun , but the creation of levels to share with the community raises the enjoyment level			2
and the inclusion of social - media connections increases the player 's audience			2
" @entity103 : @entity104 " " @entity103 : @entity104 " allows players to experiment with different augmentations to enhance their human character			2
creatively building and upgrading , gamers will discover new ways to complete missions even during replays			2
the atmosphere of the not - so - far - away future is one of hope and despair			2
the story is well - crafted and keeps players involved with little downtime or boredom			2
( @entity62 , @entity83 , @entity84 ) 6			2
" @entity121 " " @entity121 " gave hoops fans a great outlet while the real @entity124 resolved its labor dispute			1
improved animations make the action look more realistic than ever			2
the inclusion of more of the @entity124 's greatest players from the past lets you pit superstars from different eras against each other			0
and the " my player " mode lets you get drafted , work your way up the depth chart and learn to face the harsh glow of the media during press conferences			0
( @entity144 3 , @entity83 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity84 , @entity147 , @entity148 ) 5			1
" @entity149 " so many games use sex and violence as a hook to draw in players			1
" @entity149 " uses them as the canvas of a hilariously funny and sexually charged romp that also offers excellent game mechanics			0
missions are ultra-violent , outlandish and filled with tons of @entity162 moments			0
drive around with a tiger in your car			0
rescue hookers from a violent gang			0
converse with @entity168 and @entity169			0
it 's all tongue - in - cheek , fast - paced fun that players will enjoy			0
( @entity62 , @entity83 , @entity84 ) 4			0
" bastion " an independent title that shows what the " little guy " could do , " @entity174 " is a surprisingly stunning game with original weaponry , an environment that players put together as the game progresses and narration that literally tells the story of what you are doing at that time			0
dialogue is n't tied to a predetermined set of events			0
the narrator , known as the @entity191 , reacts to what your character does and makes the game seem personalized			0
it 's a game that 's fun to play but never takes itself too seriously			0
( @entity197 , @entity84 ) 3			1
" the @entity198 : @entity198 " let me say first that my top three could be shuffled in any order and it would still be right			1
but this is how i 'm shuffling them ( for now )			0
" the @entity198 : @entity198 " is an open - world , role - playing game that literally has more than 100 quests to complete			1
your character can be trained in any skill at any time , thus assuring that the game is personal to each player			0
sure , there are some minor bugs in it , but they are more amusing than frustrating			0
and any game that lets me stand at the top of a mountain while more than a dozen dragons fill the sky is a big winner in my book			1
it is enthralling , addictive and satisfying			0
( @entity62 , @entity83 , @entity84 ) 2			0
" @entity226 : @entity227 " @entity228 returns to his beloved @entity229 and discovers it to be just as violent and twisted as the dark halls of @entity233			1
his new adventures , " @entity226 : @entity227 , " expand the playing field dramatically and take the insanity into the open world			1
this allows for more freedom during combat and takes the missions away from a linear progression			0
the voice acting remains flawless , while the look of the game and its sense of foreboding throughout make it a pleasure to play			0
love all the classic villains , too			0
this " @entity226 " game was difficult to put down , even after the main story line ( which was highly dramatic ) was finished			1
( @entity62 , @entity83 , @entity84 ) 1			0
" @entity251 " outstanding characters ? check			1
@entity254 puzzle solving ? check			0
everything you 'd expect from a " portal " title returns in " @entity251 , " with some great additions			1
while the first title was all about the puzzles , this one keeps the puzzle - solving portion alive but mixes in a wonderful story that is fast - paced , informative and extremely humorous			0
origins are discovered , new alliances are formed and there is not a crumb of cake to be had			0
( that 's a reference to the original " portal , " in case you 're confused			0
) if that is n't enough , a new co-op mode allows players to play as test robots that act like @entity279			0
it 's a fantastic game from start to finish			0
( @entity84 , @entity283 , @entity62 , @entity83 )			0
