-- @entity1 is not a continent one immediately associates with ice			0
historically , however , there have been three mountains that , until recently , could proudly boast some of the world 's most majestic glaciers : @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , and the @entity11 bordering @entity12 and the @entity13			1
@entity11 has been dubbed the " @entity14 , " the " @entity15 " and the " snowy source of the @entity17 " ( the latter two descriptors were ascribed in 150 a.d. by noted astrologer and geographer @entity20 )			1
much has been written about their snow - capped peaks , but a recent expedition has found that the glaciers that have for centuries captured imaginations will soon be history			1
" unfortunately , i think it 's too late for @entity11 , " laments @entity28 , an explorer and founder of @entity31			1
" it 's not like there 's a specific local cause that you could act on			1
it 's pretty much all of us , all over the world , creating @entity40 in the air			1
" @entity28 recently led a two - week expedition to @entity11 in conjunction with @entity12 's @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46			1
his team set out to research the extent of the glaciers ' recession , and the impact it might have on the surrounding communities			2
he is n't the only one concerned by the glaciers ' demise			2
" my guess is by 2030 , there wo n't be any ice left on the mountain , " says @entity55 , a geology professor at @entity56			0
the glaciers , which had a combined area of around 2.7 square miles at the start of the 20th century , now occupy less than 0.4 square miles			2
@entity55 estimates that the ice is declining by roughly 0.2 square miles per decade			0
" really , you 're looking at a last chance to see , " he says			0
though @entity11 does n't get the same tourist traffic as @entity8 or @entity10 ( both of which are also suffering ; @entity8 has lost 84 % of its ice since 1912 , and two - thirds of @entity10 's ice cover has vanished ) , the modest numbers it does receive are likely to dry up with the ice			1
" @entity76 [ the local tribe that live in the mountains ] do depend on tourism			2
they provide nature walks and act as guides			0
with the glaciers receding , those local people will suffer from lack of jobs , " says @entity82 , a student at @entity83 's @entity44 , who took part in @entity28 's @entity11 expedition			1
@entity28 has described the melting glaciers as a " canary in the mine , " with their decline illustrating how climate change is starting to impact the local environment			2
" the glaciers indicate a rise in temperature in the region , and a warmer environment leads to an intensification of the rainfall systems , " says @entity55			0
" what that means is longer droughts and more intense floods			0
" droughts could spell disaster for the local @entity109 , who rely on the water from the local alpine rivers to irrigate their crops and provide hydroelectricity			0
the warmer weather could also severely alter the ecosystem and potentially usher in malaria ( according to @entity55 , this is a disease the @entity109 have historically not had to deal with , perhaps because the alpine climate has traditionally deterred mosquitoes )			0
" it could be we will lose some very rare plant species at the summit , " adds @entity55 .			0

@entity12 's @entity11 have been described as the ' @entity125 '
experts predict the range 's once *sizable* glaciers will soon vanish
that could mean less income for locals from tourism
