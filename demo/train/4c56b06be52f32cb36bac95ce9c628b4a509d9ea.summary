" illegal bleaching creams and soaps are a major problem , " @entity3 says			1
" and once we eradicate it from @entity9 , it will go to another borough where there 's a big @entity37 or @entity38 population			0
" skin bleaching -- using chemical or natural products to lighten skin color -- is common practice in the @entity44 , @entity45 , across @entity46 , and increasingly , in @entity47			1
psychologists say consumer demand can be traced to perceptions that lighter skinned or white people are more successful , intelligent and sexually desirable			2
and as the @entity12 's @entity37 , @entity53 and @entity53 - @entity54 communities grow , so too -- cosmetics industry experts say -- does ethnic spending power for products promoted to lighten skin tone			1
but some of these creams , soaps and solutions contain hydroquinone , an ingredient that is banned in cosmetic products sold in the @entity12			1
the @entity66 says based on experiments done on animals , it " can not rule out " hydroquinone 's potential cancer risk in humans			0
use of the ingredient in over-the - counter cosmetics is restricted , but still legal , in the @entity75 , @entity45 and other countries			2
and some of these products are making their way to store shelves across the @entity12			2
the police officers say they are stationed to keep the peace , as @entity3 asks the store manager why the banned products are for sale			0
she says the bleaching soaps were an oversight : " the soaps are just something that 's come on our shelves without us realizing			2
to sell this would be stupidity , " she says			0

" dr. @entity126 , a leading psychologist at @entity127 , blames consumer demand on the media centering on fair skinned blacks like @entity75 pop singer @entity131 and @entity12 actress @entity132			1
" the image that the media presents about black people is that we are inferior , we are not as good as everybody else			0
but those who are successful and going places are those who are light - skinned people			1
so one might say that the desire to be like white people underpins people 's wanting to be fairer - skinned , " @entity126 says			1

" there is no safe way to bleach your skin beyond your natural color , " says @entity182 , a research scientist			0
" initially , [ the bleaching cream ] will appear to lighten the skin , " she says			0
" the reaction between the sun and chemicals triggers an oxidation reaction , which then starts turning the skin darker ... and as the skin gets darker , one uses more cream more vigorously			0
