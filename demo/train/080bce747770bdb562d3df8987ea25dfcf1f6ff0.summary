@entity0 -- tens of thousands of hurried passengers trying to check in at some of the busiest @entity6 airports could soon find themselves in the fast lane			2
the @entity8 and the @entity9 are expanding their expedited screening initiative known as @entity11 to 28 additional airports this year , it was announced wednesday			1
seven airports across the country have already started the procedures , which allow travelers a faster screening process if they volunteer information about themselves prior to flying			2
in making the announcement at a news conference at @entity23 , @entity8 officials said @entity11 will enable @entity9 to focus its efforts on passengers the agency knows less about in a more risk - based approach to screening			1
if the @entity9 determines a passenger is eligible for expedited screening , " information will be embedded in the barcode of the passenger 's boarding pass , " according to the department			1
passengers who qualify may only rarely have to remove their shoes , jackets and belts , and extract laptops or liquids from bags			0
" good , thoughtful , sensible security by its very nature facilitates lawful travel and legitimate commerce , " said @entity8 secretary @entity43			0
" the expansion of @entity11 to the nation 's busiest airports will increase our security capabilities and expedite the screening process for travelers we consider our trusted partners			1
" the " trusted traveler " program wo n't guarantee expedited security screening , officials say			0
participants will still be subject to random and unpredictable security measures			0
