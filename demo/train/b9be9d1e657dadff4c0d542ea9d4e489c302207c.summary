-- @entity1 usually means family , food , football and , of course , the kickoff of the holiday shopping season with @entity8 and cyber monday			1
with so much consumption going on , giving back can easily be overlooked			2
the @entity11 in @entity12 hopes to change that with its social media movement # @entity14			1
# @entity16 is not a charity drive to benefit one cause but a call for many organizations and individuals to give to those less fortunate during this time of year , say its organizers			1
retailers around the country will host donation drives in stores on tuesday			0
meanwhile , participants with an online presence are soliciting charitable contributions from their social media followers			1
" we began thinking about this around the holidays last year , but work truly began in earnest in the spring , " said @entity31 , spokesman for the community center and the movement 's mastermind			0
" what 's been so inspiring is how many organizations and individuals have taken up the charge for # @entity14			1
" @entity16 creates better @entity44 narrative than @entity8 the message is " people do n't have to be a billionaire or a big name to be a philanthropist			2
" anyone can make a lasting impact when they donate and advocate for causes that matter to them , @entity31 said			0
as the hashtag suggests , social media is central to the @entity16 effort			1
relying on its social media connections , @entity11 was able to reach millions of people and spread the word about the event			1
the @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66 have joined the effort			0
altogether , there are more than 2,000 organizations participating in the @entity16 event nationwide			1
people can donate to any charity they wish , and # @entity73 's charitable partners can use any method they wish to give back			2
for instance , @entity63 will launch a donor - matching campaign for @entity77 , a " micro-giving " site that strives to fund young people 's ambitions			2
" this new way of building communities and sharing with one another is the way that modern movements will take hold , and social media is the medium that can connect these communities , not only at greater speeds and across boundaries , but in authentic and lasting ways , " said @entity82 , ceo of the @entity62			1
" we view social media as more than just the broadcaster for this conversation about giving ; it 's the connector			1
" some groups have even taken a page from @entity11 and created a social media plan to focus their contribution efforts			1
@entity102 will host a donation - match @entity104 campaign , inviting its community to tweet what they 'll be doing on # @entity16			2
each tweet that mentions @entity102 's @entity104 handle and contains the phrase # @entity16 will be matched with a $ 5 donation to the @entity66			2
@entity111 will tap @entity112 , the online scrapbooking site , for a " pin it to give it " donation campaign			2
from # @entity14 until the end of the year , @entity111 will give a dollar for every @entity111 product re-pinned on the " pin it to give it " board , up to $ 25,000			1
the money will go to the @entity123 to benefit the @entity124			0
it is n't just online that people can contribute to the @entity16 event -- live events are also planned			1
a benefit auction for @entity131 victims is scheduled in @entity132 , and at every @entity135 shopping mall in the country , shoppers will be able to donate to charities			0
while some may say the @entity1 holiday has become too commercialized thanks to huge retails deals drawing consumers to shopping centers before most people have finished washing dishes , # @entity14 is not about competing with other events of the season			1
according to @entity31 , it 's about starting the " giving season " and creating a specific day for people and businesses to give back			0
after reporting a record high of more than $ 314 billion in donations in 2007 , charities saw a combined 13 % decline in donations for the next two years , $ 299 billion in 2008 and $ 280 billion in 2009 , according to giving @entity156			2
" our revised estimates show that 2008 and 2009 saw the largest drops in giving in more than 40 years as a result of the @entity164 , exceeding previous recessions ' impact on giving , " @entity157 , chair of giving @entity158 , said in a statement			0
in 2011 , the total amount contributed to philanthropy saw an $ 8 billion increase from 2010			0
the @entity170 said that with the country coming out of recession , people are feeling better about their financial well - being , which has allowed them to start donating again			0
" we believe that # @entity14 can not only inspire more donations , in terms of both donation dollars and volunteer hours , but can help change the dialogue about giving , " @entity175 said			1
" this first year has shown us how much people are willing to contribute , even in tough economic times , to make a difference in the life of one person in their community or to groups of people around the world			0
" even in tough economic times , people are still willing to give and spend			0
holiday sales for this year are projected to reach $ 586 billion , which is a 4 % increase over last year , according to the @entity194			0
@entity31 said he thinks people will manage to satisfy their thirst for a great bargain as well give back to a charity			0
" @entity8 and @entity199 are really important days for our economy , and we all enjoy the chance to get a deal , " said @entity31			1
" after two days set aside for getting deals , it feels right to have a day dedicated for giving back			0
" the event , which organizers hope will become a mainstay during the holiday season , kicks off tuesday			0
