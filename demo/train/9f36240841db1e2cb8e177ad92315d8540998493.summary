-- when the new @entity4 season gets underway in march , for the first time there will be a woman running a team 's entire operations from track to boardroom			1
the team is @entity11 and the woman in charge is @entity14 , an @entity15 - born lawyer who has risen to the top in this male - dominated sport			1
@entity14 , 41 , has been ceo of @entity11 -- sixth in last year 's team championship -- since 2010 , but in october she also took over from @entity19 as team principal , putting her in charge of performance on the track as well as the business operation			1
" as team principal you have a very exposed position at the track side , " said @entity14			1
" it 's really about the racing			2
" @entity14 has fought for recognition in a sport where another team boss -- whom she is too polite to name -- once mistook her for @entity19 's interpreter			1
" it was an elderly gentleman who has a different kind of thinking , " she said			0
" he soon realized and was highly embarrassed			0
" others have been more subtle , but still betray a surprise to see a woman in her job			0
" it 's the first moment when you are introduced with your title and you see a slight surprise , " said @entity14			1
" i hope that my record will encourage more women and girls to come into motorsport			0
" @entity14 is a member and ambassador for the @entity53 set up by governing body , the @entity55			2
the commission promotes women drivers in the @entity55 's karting and rally championships and has a network of national coordinators encouraging girls and women in their countries			2
" there 's a project in schools which looks at all the roles in the team from financial and technical to marketing , and 30 % of participants are girls , " she said			2
" for me it 's very important because we need to help women and young girls to be given the opportunity			2
" however , those hoping to see a woman @entity4 driver reach a pole position anytime soon could be disappointed			2
" i think it will take a while because it 's a tough world out there to reach @entity4 , " said @entity14			1
" there are just 22 drivers out of hundreds of thousands worldwide			0
" it 's important we start at the roots and groom the girls in the same way the boys are groomed			0
" for some , @entity4 's macho image and use of " grid girls " -- glamorous women who hold markers giving teams ' grid position -- undermines its efforts to be taken seriously by women			1
not for @entity14 , however			2
" i do n't have a problem with that image , " she said			0
" i think girls are prettier to look at than if you had men in those roles			0
" there 's nothing wrong with the image because nobody is being discriminated against			0
" see also : @entity4 revolution ahead after ' identikit ' 2013 season @entity14 was born @entity14 in @entity110 , @entity15 , and moved with her parents to @entity112 at the age of eight			1
although her first ambition was to be an astronaut , she trained as a lawyer and had only a passing interest in @entity4			1
" i grew up in @entity112 and when i was a child , there were famous @entity112 drivers like @entity120 and @entity121 and a race in @entity112 , so i had a basic knowledge of the sport , " she said			0
she never imagined , however , that she would make a career out of it until she was approached to join the legal team of @entity128 in 1998			1
@entity129 was a shareholder in what was then the @entity134 @entity133 team			0
" when i joined the company in @entity136 i saw what happens behind the scenes and there 's so much more to it , " she said			0
" the first time i came to the factory and saw what it takes to make a formula 1 car , it became a passion			0
" when @entity129 sold off his shares in the team , @entity14 moved to @entity150 in @entity151 to run @entity153 's legal department			1
so began her inexorable rise through the company , joining its board in 2001 , becoming ceo in 2010 and finally team principal in 2012			1
she is unusual in being a team principal with a legal , rather than a technical background , but insists it does not put her at a disadvantage			1
see : the most ambitious women on earth " with a legal background you learn to ask the right questions , " said @entity14			1
" most areas are so highly specialized that you hardly find a technical person who has detailed knowledge of all areas			0
people from different backgrounds enrich the sport			0
" @entity14 is married with two children , aged 10 and seven , and has to cope with a lot of time away from her family during the racing season			2
" i 'm often away , which makes it very tough , but they take it well			0
i try to have a lot of contact with them when i 'm away , " she said			0
it was not until 2011 , however , that she took her children to a @entity4 race , and they now go to the @entity191 once a year			2
however , " there 's so much work and noise that it 's not a place for little kids , " she said			0
@entity14 's first full season in charge begins with the @entity199 @entity191 on march 17			1
there is a new car -- the @entity202 -- and a new team of drivers , @entity206 @entity205 , recently signed from @entity207 , and @entity209 @entity208 , previously @entity11 's reserve driver			1
for @entity14 , it will be a first chance to take full control of the team she has made her own .			1

@entity14 became @entity4 's first *female* team principal in october
she is in charge of both business and on - the - track performance of @entity11 , sixth in last year 's team championship
trained as a lawyer , @entity14 came to @entity4 by chance , after joining legal team of one of @entity11 's shareholders
