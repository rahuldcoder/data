-- it 's been a rough year for @entity2 , as the laconic singer has endured everything from tour - canceling illnesses to possibly being dropped from his new label to bizarre allegations of a murder - for - hire plot			1
however , in a new interview with @entity12 , the former @entity10 singer reveals he 's dealing with some health issues that make all those other troubles seem insignificant			1
according to @entity2 , he 's had a cancer scare , although in talking about the disease , the singer does n't seem that scared at all			1
@entity2 talks about his health , sex appeal " they have scraped cancerous tissues four times already , but whatever , " @entity2 told the spanish - language @entity12 ( via a translation by the @entity25 )			1
" if i die , then i die			2
and if i do n't , then i do n't			0
right now i feel good			0
i am aware that in some of my recent photos i look somewhat unhealthy , but that 's what illness can do			2
i 'm not going to worry about that			0
i 'll rest when i 'm dead			0
" over the past few years , @entity2 has canceled tour dates for reasons like food poisoning , bleeding ulcers , pneumonia and a sickness he blamed on his opening act , but this is the first time the usually candid rocker has uttered the c - word aloud			1
in early 2013 , @entity2 spent some time in a @entity42 hospital after suffering from " a concussion , a bleeding ulcer and @entity46 's esophagus			1
" @entity2 denies former bodyguard 's allegations after canceling six @entity51 shows following his hospital stay , the singer penned a grim letter to fans where he discussed his own mortality			1
" the reports of my death have been greatly understated , " @entity2 wrote			1
" the positive from all of this is that there are now no known ailments left for me to try			0
" the singer also joked about an upcoming @entity65 concert , writing , " if there 's an audience of any kind in attendance , i just might die with a smile on my face , after all			2
if i am not there , i shall probably never again be anywhere			0
equally , i am determined to play @entity74 [ @entity42 ] if it kills me ( which , on the face of it , it almost has )			0
" he concluded the letter by signing off , " pause at my headstone , @entity2			2
" @entity2 partners spar over cancellation in a recent interview where @entity2 talked about his many health issues , he proclaimed that , " the worst was in june in @entity83 , when i was hospitalized with acute fever			1
i was delirious for six hours , talking absolute nonsense and unable to stop			0
i 've never been so frightened in my life			0
then , of course , you get these bitchy comments for having to cancel shows ...			0
i 've been to so many hospitals lately that there 's hardly any point in my leaving			2
" at press time , @entity2 has n't updated his fan sites about the cancer reports			2
whatever the diagnosis , @entity2 is back out on the road , and @entity100 reports that the singer 's backing band is proudly donning shirts that say " @entity109 " as a nod to his record label after the label released @entity2 's new lp " @entity108			1
