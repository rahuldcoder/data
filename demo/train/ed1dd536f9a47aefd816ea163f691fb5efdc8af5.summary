@entity0 -- accused @entity4 bomber @entity3 should be allowed to view autopsy photos of the attack 's victims and meet with his sister without being watched by the @entity9 , a federal judge said wednesday			1
prosecutors had asked @entity12 district judge @entity11 to keep @entity3 " from personally reviewing autopsy photographs of victims " other than those the government plans to use at his trial , set for november			1
letting him see the rest " would violate the victims ' rights to dignity and privacy and subject them to needless harm and suffering , " they wrote			1
the photos are already covered by a protective order in the case			0
also , the government 's request did n't apply to @entity3 's lawyers , who have had access to the pictures			1
but defense attorneys refused to accept any restrictions , calling the request unprecedented and unwarranted , and @entity11 agreed			2
@entity3 , now 20 , is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race along with his brother @entity39 , who was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed @entity0			2
the city marked the anniversary of the attacks on tuesday , pausing to remember the three people who died and more than 200 who were wounded , many of whom lost limbs			0
the trial is set for early november , with the government seeking the death penalty			0
defense lawyers are expected to argue @entity3 was under the " domination and control " of his brother			1
@entity3 was not in court for wednesday 's proceedings			0
@entity11 also said meetings between @entity3 and his sister should n't be subject to monitoring by investigators , though he held off on issuing a final order on the matter			0
@entity3 lawyer @entity65 argued that letting federal agents monitor their conversation would intrude on the defense			1
" the decision to take the most casual remarks , an ironic comment , and provide it to the prosecution ... becomes ammunition on the death penalty , " @entity65 said			0
if the charges against @entity3 are true , he said , " this is about a family , " and lawyers should be allowed to observe the relationship between the siblings without interference			2
assistant u.s. attorney @entity83 argued that defense lawyers were trying to combine a legal visit with a social one			1
@entity11 said he did n't think there was a security issue involved and he was inclined to grant the defense request , but did n't issue a formal ruling			0
@entity1 's @entity91 reported from @entity0 ; @entity92 reported and wrote from @entity93 .			0
