for @entity1 , music is life			2
on a typical day , the @entity4 student spends hours on her laptop , scouring the internet for the latest music			2
she uses a site that aggregates music recommendations from blogs to discover new artists and songs , streams them online and then shares her finds with her friends through a @entity15 group			2
but she rarely buys songs or albums			0
" if i really love an artist and i want to support them , i will buy their music , " said @entity1 , 21			2
" you can find [ music ] on the radio and tv , but those songs are chosen for you			2
the @entity6 allows you to find your own music			2
" young listeners like @entity1 represent a looming sea change for the music industry , which has been in upheaval since the @entity34 era of the late 1990s			1
five years ago , music consumers had to choose between buying a cd or downloading the album			2
nowadays , thanks to the rise of music - streaming services like @entity42 and @entity43 , that choice is becoming whether to download music or just stream it online			1
interviews with college - age music fans suggest that more and more are choosing to stream music instead of downloading it			1
after all , why pay for music when you can summon almost any song you want , at any time , for free ? and the growth of music apps , online radio channels , and music - streaming platforms raise an even larger question : do we really need to ' own ' music anymore ? " the last time i bought a cd was probably in middle school , and i ca n't even remember what it was , " said @entity59 , 21 , of @entity60 , @entity61			1
" ninety percent of my friends stream music			1
to be honest , i have n't seen someone use @entity68 in a really long time			0
" in five years , @entity59 believes " streaming will be the norm			2
it 's more practical and more convenient than buying music and uploading it onto something			0
and the best part is , it 's free			0
" @entity42 , @entity43 and 8tracks the popularity of listening to music online can be directly linked to the emergence of music - streaming sites like @entity43 , @entity42 and @entity80 , which have grown substantially in the past year			1
these and numerous other sites now offer people the ability to listen to music without paying			1
and they 're changing the way people consume music , says @entity88 , publisher and editor - in - chief of @entity90			1
" we are already seeing a trend on the aggregate with the lack of music ownership , " said @entity88 , who believes the difference between a download and a stream is starting to blur			1
" if i can get that @entity101 song anywhere and anytime , what is the difference ? " streaming sites are a big step away from the familiar @entity106 @entity68 business model , which allows users to download a song or album and then upload it to an @entity111 , @entity112 or other portable device			1
@entity106 to kill social network @entity114 , report says @entity43 offers users a database of more than 16 million songs for free , although the service limits how many hours of music a user can stream in a month without a paid subscription			1
users can pull up any song in @entity43 's database , or create custom playlists			0
the site launched in 2008 in @entity129 but did n't become available in the @entity130 until last year			0
it now claims to have more than 20 million active users			0
@entity42 acts like an online radio station , streaming free music 24 hours a day in a mix that users can customize , using @entity42 's algorithms based on their tastes			1
unlike @entity43 , members can not request specific songs , however			0
@entity42 now claims more than 150 million users in the @entity130 alone			1
@entity42 's application has been among the most - downloaded free apps for iphones and @entity145 , demonstrating that streaming is becoming a mainstream way to listen to music on portable devices			1
@entity42 is now available on more than 400 connected devices , the company says			1
then there is 8tracks , an online radio station that offers a more social music experience for its users			1
named one of the top 50 best websites by @entity159 last year , 8tracks provides its listeners with free music hand - selected by other site users known as " djs			1
" " the programming is crafted by people rather than an algorithm , " said @entity165 , ceo and founder of the site , which has seen a drastic increase in users			0
8tracks users can upload tracks from their personal collection or use music from @entity178 , a site that emphasizes artists from independent labels			1
although relatively new , 8tracks already has 5 million active users , @entity165 said			0
" if you want a song on demand , @entity183 is the place to go , but if you want to discover music you would go to @entity42 or 8tracks , " he said			1
like @entity43 and other services , 8tracks also offers a mobile app that allows users to stream music free to their phones			1
a brief guide to online music owning music " a lot of work ' @entity106 's @entity68 is still the world 's most popular music vendor , with more than 225 million accounts			1
one reason streaming music is catching on is the rise of online or mobile apps built on large music providers , such as @entity106 , that have already secured copyrights on songs , says @entity209 , editor and chief of @entity211 , an independent music publication " you can now build apps on top of apps , and everything is legal and no one is getting sued			1
in terms of music fans , it is a bit confusing because there are so many options , " he said			0
" i think downloading came from a time when our mp3 players did n't have @entity231 connections and our computers did not connect that fast			0
" but @entity234 also suggests another reason for streaming , not acquiring music			2
" there is a certain relief with not having to own music			0
it is a lot of work , " he said			0
" so the challenge is how to still feel like you are building a [ music ] collection			0
" portability of music is another big issue for many consumers			0
recent @entity253 , 23 , says she needs her music accessible all the time			0
" if i could reliably stream music for free to all of my portable devices i would use streaming sites exclusively , " she told @entity257			1
@entity261 says she prefers streaming because it allows her to access a large variety of music			2
" i discovered she and @entity266 , @entity268 's band before she was ridiculously famous , and i never would have sought it out on my own , " she said			0
@entity165 says the way people own music is transforming			2
he believes the cloud model is where the state of music is heading , and for many people ownership is not essential			1
" i think ownership is access , you do n't have to have music on your local hard drive to own it , " he said			2
@entity284 : how bedroom beat boys remixed the industry old media sticks around if you listen to some young people , you might think that few people in the future will ever want to own music			1
but @entity293 , professor of economics and law at @entity295 , disagrees			0
@entity293 believes that music consumers ' transition to a full streaming model will be a lot slower than people think			1
" old media sticks around , " he said			0
" @entity301 is still around , and just because tech is new does n't mean it is better in all dimensions			0
" he cited vehicles as one area where streaming music will be slow to gain a foothold			2
" think of @entity34 , " he said			0
" when it came out people were saying the record labels would disappear , but they did n't			0
" there is more to owning music than simply the convenience that digital media provides			0
some consumers still want to own a physical memento by an artist they love , whether it 's a cd with artwork and liner notes or just a few lines of digital ones and zeroes on their smart phone			1
maybe that 's why sales of vinyl records have been on the upswing in recent years			0
@entity88 says this is because the need to own music is also influenced by human psychology			0
" the music fan never ceases to surprise me , " he said			0
" if you told me five years ago there would be a boom in the sale of vinyl records i would have laughed			0
but people are buying them , and i think there are some people that will continue to buy music [ and not just stream it ]			1
" overheard on @entity257 : streaming debate strikes chord with music fans how are you accessing music ? share with us in the comments below .			2

music streaming sites such as @entity42 and 8tracks are popular
the idea of what is music ownership is changing , *observers* note
but some music lovers will always want to have a physical memento
