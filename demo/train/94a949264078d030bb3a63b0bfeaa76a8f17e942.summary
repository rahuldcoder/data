@entity0 -- a 2004 crash that killed everyone on board -- three crew members and three @entity7 troops -- was caused by pilots from a @entity10 plane taking a low - level run through a mountain canyon in @entity13 , testimony revealed tuesday			1
a twin - engine @entity16 , similar to the plane pictured , crashed in 2004 , killing all six on board			1
" i swear to @entity24 , they would n't pay me if they knew how much fun this was , " the doomed plane 's cockpit voice recorder captured the pilot saying shortly before the november 27 , 2004 , crash			1
the account of the crash emerged during a @entity31 hearing on @entity10 's performance in @entity33 and @entity13			1
in its november 2006 report on the crash , the @entity34 concluded that @entity10 provided insufficient oversight and guidance of the pilots involved in the 2004 crash			1
dispatchers failed to ensure that pilots followed their flight plan and did not adequately track flights in the air			0
the @entity34 said the military " did not provide adequate oversight of the contract carrier 's operations in @entity13			1
" the company 's chairman , @entity50 , appeared before the committee to defend the firm tuesday			0
the twin - engine @entity16 , a light cargo plane operated by @entity10 sister company @entity56 , crashed in a box canyon well off its planned route from @entity59 to the western @entity13 town of @entity61			1
" you 're an x-wing fighter @entity70 man , " an @entity34 report quoted the plane 's co-pilot , @entity63 , saying during the flight -- a reference to the dizzying battle in the 1977 film			2
" you 're [ expletive ] right			0
this is fun , " the pilot , @entity72 , responded			0
about eight minutes later , the plane slammed into the wall of the canyon , which was flanked by ridgelines that rose nearly a mile above surrounding terrain			2
when rescuers found the wreckage three days later , they discovered one of the passengers had survived the crash only to die of internal bleeding and exposure , the @entity34 found			0
when an unidentified passenger asked about the plane 's route before the crash , flight mechanic @entity87 told him , " i do n't know what we 're gon na see			2
we do n't normally go this route			0
" @entity72 added , " all we want is to avoid seeing rock at 12 o'clock			0
" @entity96 and @entity63 had been in @entity13 less than two weeks , the @entity34 found			2
federal investigators found each should have been paired with a more experienced aviator , according to rep. @entity99 , @entity100			2
@entity99 is chairman of the oversight committee , which is investigating @entity10 's performance on more than $ 1 billion in @entity7 government contracts since 2001			1
he said a company e-mail stated the company had overlooked experience requirements " in favor of getting the requisite number of personnel on board to start up the contract			0
" " the corporation hired inexperienced pilots			0
they sent them on a route they did n't know about , " @entity99 said			2
" it seems to me that it 's more than pilot error			1
there ought to be corporate responsibility , and @entity10 was the corporation involved			1
" @entity50 said investigators concluded the crash in @entity13 was not due to corporate error , but pilot error			1
he rejected @entity99 's contention that the pilots " acted like cowboys			1
" " we provided thousands and thousands of flight hours of arrival service since then , " @entity50 said			0
" today , still , we 're flying more than a thousand missions a month			0
" passengers on the flight included lt. col. @entity137 , the commander of a @entity141 - based @entity140 aviation battalion ; and two members of his unit , chief warrant officer @entity144 , and spc. @entity145			0
in a letter read to the committee , @entity137 's widow , col. @entity146 , wrote the accident was the result of a " gross lack of judgment in managing this company			0
" her husband 's unit had a great safety record , she wrote : " it 's ironic and unfortunate that he had to be a passenger on this plane versus one of the people responsible for its safe operation			2
" the families of the passengers have filed suit against @entity56 and its related firms			0
@entity10 's effort to dismiss the case is before a federal appeals court in @entity174 , plaintiff 's lawyer @entity169 said			1
the company has come under scrutiny over its work in @entity33 , where government officials accuse its contractors of killing as many as 20 civilians in a september clash in @entity182			1
the @entity183 hired @entity10 to fly cargo to sites in @entity13 , where larger transports are unable to take off or land			1
@entity50 described the job as " rugged , @entity190 - style bush flying			0
" and he said the military violated its own regulations by flying 400 pounds of 81mm mortar rounds along with the passengers and gear			0
