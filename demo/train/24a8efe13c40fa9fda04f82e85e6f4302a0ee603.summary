-- @entity2 's major archaeological sites , monuments and museums were under the protection of the country 's army on monday , according to the nation 's @entity8			1
however , unease persisted among @entity11 and archaeologists , who fear some of the nation 's priceless treasures may fall victim to looters or vandals , amid unrest and uprisings fueled by what protesters see as a lack of economic opportunity , widespread poverty and pervasive corruption			1
@entity2 is " the greatest open - air museum in the world , " said @entity28 , the @entity29 professor of @entity30 at @entity31			1
he said he and his colleagues are " trying to stay on top of ( the situation ) as best we can , " given spotty internet service in @entity2			1
friday night , a group of " criminals " entered the @entity39 using a fire department staircase , @entity41 , secretary - general of the @entity8 , told @entity0 early sunday			1
once inside the museum , they went to the @entity45 gallery , @entity41 wrote			0
" when they found no gold , they broke 13 vitrines ( glass showcases ) and threw the antiquities on the floor			0
" the intruders then went back to the gallery housing artifacts from @entity57 's tomb , where they opened one showcase , broke a statue of @entity57 on a panther and threw it to the ground , he wrote			2
a group also entered the museum gift shop and stole jewelry , @entity41 wrote in a blog post sunday			0
a group of " tourist police officers " had stayed at the museum overnight , as they were unable to leave after the curfew took effect			0
" these officers , and many young @entity2 who were also there , helped to stop more people from entering the museum " during the protests , @entity41 wrote in the blog post -- which he faxed to @entity74 so colleagues there could post it on his website in the absence of internet in @entity2			1
@entity41 told @entity0 early sunday there were nine suspects , but in the blog post he said there were 10			0
one of them asked the people guarding the museum for water , he said , but " they took his hands and tied him to the door that led to the gift shop so he could not escape , " according to the post			0
@entity41 told @entity0 that when the suspects were apprehended , authorities found the remains of two mummies and some small artifacts with them			2
however , he said sunday , everything that had been damaged can be restored			0
it may be that @entity2 citizens ' national pride in their heritage works to the advantage of its treasures , experts said			1
a picture was posted on @entity113 of a " human chain " surrounding the @entity39 , although it was unclear when the chain was formed			1
in many ways , @entity28 said , that national pride is a tribute to @entity121 ' efforts in raising awareness and restoring pride in @entity2 culture			1
" you may be seeing the direct result " of his efforts , he said			0
" the @entity2 people are absolutely wonderful , " said @entity128 , an egyptologist at the @entity129 and curator at the @entity131			1
she said she believes they can be counted on to defend museums and archaeological sites			1
" with 80 million people in a country that suffers from poverty and rising food prices ... you have to expect that some people are going to be desperate and look for any means necessary to try to improve their lot , " said @entity136 , assistant professor of @entity2 art and architecture at the @entity139 , @entity140 , and host of the @entity142 's " out of @entity2			1
" but , she said , for every one of those , there are a thousand @entity2 who will defend ancient treasures			1
" the people who are best able to protect these monuments are already there on the ground , " she said			2
" ... i just have to hope and trust that they 're able to do what they can			0
" @entity136 said she had heard , but had n't been able to confirm , that authorities used a mosque 's loudspeaker to successfully urge citizens to come to the aid of the temple complex at @entity167 and defend it from looters			1
on monday , @entity41 said all sites in northern @entity2 , including @entity171 , were under the control of the army			1
museums , he said , are also safe , along with major tourist sites in @entity176 and @entity177 near @entity178 , and @entity179 and @entity180 farther south			1
so far , " only small things " have occurred , he said -- for instance , a storage magazine was entered in the @entity185 area and some objects were taken			0
in that incident , @entity41 wrote , a " large group , armed with guns and a truck " entered a site where antiquities from the @entity190 are stored and took some objects			0
" other groups attempted to enter the @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 of @entity171 , and @entity199 , " he wrote			0
" my heart is broken and my blood is boiling , " he wrote in the sunday post			0
" i feel that everything i have done in the last nine years has been destroyed in one day , but all the inspectors , young archaeologists and administrators are calling me from museums all over @entity2 to tell me that they will give their life to protect our antiquities			1
many young @entity2 are in the streets trying to stop the criminals			1
" despite @entity41 ' assurances , @entity11 said they are concerned both about damage that has not yet been discovered and about what the future might hold for @entity2 's artifacts			1
@entity28 said he had heard that when @entity2 police disappeared from streets over the weekend , some sites were left unguarded			1
there are hundreds of storage magazines around the country , which had previously been under the protection of @entity2 police , @entity136 said			2
now , it is unclear who -- if anyone -- is protecting them			2
reports of the incident at the @entity39 were " heartbreaking , " said @entity128 , who spent the summer working on a project in @entity179 involving the uncovering of tombs			2
she said she had heard " it was basically quiet " in @entity179 , " but that 's for now			0
we expect things may change			0
" the @entity237 and other important archaeological sites are located there , she said			2
@entity128 said she is " on @entity244 all the time " trying to make contact with @entity11 and archaeologists she knows , to see if they remain at certain sites			1
some have fled the unrest , she said			0
" this has been my life 's work , " she said			0
" ... we do n't know what the future will hold			1
i hope at least some things can be preserved			0
" @entity244 , @entity136 said , is " invaluable " as @entity11 try to share information			2
@entity28 said most of his work is done at @entity176 , and he expects the site there will be well protected			0
there is a " high - security wall " surrounding it , he said , and its proximity to @entity178 may result in better protection			0
he said he is more worried about the outlying sites			2
" some of these monuments are big , so it 's easy ( for a criminal ) to duck behind something			0
" he recalled incidents of artifacts and monuments being destroyed in @entity272 , saying his heart went out to colleagues who made those artifacts their field of study -- and wondered then how it might feel if it were @entity2 's artifacts in danger			1
he had hoped he would never find out			0
worries are compounded , @entity136 said , by the lack of reliable information -- experts have no way of knowing whether information is solid or if they are hearing a rumor			2
" some things have turned out not to be true , " she said			0
@entity28 said he had heard that sites in @entity290 and @entity177 had been broken into			2
@entity290 is a pyramid field on the left bank of the @entity293 , north of @entity177 , where many 5th dynasty pharaohs chose to site their burial monuments			0
@entity177 , one of @entity2 's oldest burial sites , has several royal pyramids			1
however , @entity41 said monday that while padlocks for tombs at @entity177 were opened , nothing had been taken , damaged or disturbed			0
work at some sites is continuing despite the unrest , @entity136 said , but colleagues at other sites have been asked to leave by @entity2 police			1
@entity41 said he has faith in both the @entity2 people and troops			2
he told @entity0 that when he left the @entity39 -- after rushing there saturday morning following the curfew being lifted -- " all the people in the streets were asking me , ' is the @entity39 safe ? we need to protect the museum			1
' " " a very small number of people tried to break , steal and rob , " he wrote in his blog post " sadly , one criminal voice is louder than one hundred voices of peace			0
the @entity2 people are calling for freedom , not destruction			2

@entity2 official : the army is protecting sites and museums
experts believe @entity2 ' national pride will help protect valuable artifacts
but @entity11 do n't know what the future will hold
citizens helped apprehend looters at the @entity39
