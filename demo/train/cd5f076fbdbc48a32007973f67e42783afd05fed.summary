@entity0 @entity3 's announcement on saturday to end his @entity5 show marked yet another significant move by a key player in the race for the @entity10 presidential nomination , bringing the 2016 contest further into focus as a deep bench of prospective candidates begins to test the waters			1
the former @entity17 governor said saturday night 's episode of " @entity3 " would be his last			1
it was a necessary step , he said , as he explores a second presidential bid , a decision he stressed he wo n't finalize until the spring			1
" i say goodbye , but as we say in television , stay tuned			0
there 's more to come , " he said at the end of his show			2
his announcement comes nearly three weeks after former @entity29 gov. @entity28 announced he will " actively explore " a possible run			2
a source close to @entity3 's political operation said the decision to leave @entity5 has been long in the works and argued @entity28 's timing had " zero " impact on @entity3 's strategy			1
@entity3 is set to take another typical pre-presidential step when he releases his book " @entity40 , " on jan. 20			1
his promotional tour is already scheduled to take him to @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			0
the @entity42 book signing takes place one day after he is scheduled to appear at a jan. 24 @entity49 event , hosted by rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 , a conservative nonprofit based in @entity0			1
all told , the former governor will make 30 stops in 10 states over 10 days for his book tour , according to the source , including visits to the early primary state of @entity61 , in addition to @entity51			1
his website says he 's also leading a group of people to @entity66 in february			0
@entity66 is a common stop for prospective presidential candidates , though it 's a trip he 's also made in the past			2
@entity3 rocketed to conservative fame in early january 2008 after he went from a long - shot candidate to the surprise victor of @entity42 's first - in - the - nation caucuses			1
the win catapulted him into a fairly competitive race against sen. @entity77 , but the @entity79 senator surged ahead and clinched the nomination in early march 2008			0
three years later , @entity3 considered another run but ultimately declined to throw his hat in the ring , announcing his decision on his show in may 2011			1
with @entity3 back in the spotlight as a serious prospective candidate and with his television show no longer a distraction , his focus will shift toward securing the financial footing that he lacked in 2008 to sustain a prolonged campaign			1
" if he decides to run this time , i think that 's something we will be able to remedy , " the source said			0
" it 's one of the things that he learned eight years ago : make sure you have the financial resources to compete			2
" in fact , @entity3 spent a considerable amount of time on the campaign trail last year , rubbing elbows with donors and activists as he made multiples stops to each of the three early primary states to help 2014 candidates and speak at conservative and evangelical gatherings			1
he has consistently done well in polls measuring support for the potential 2016 @entity10 field , ranking higher in many cases than other possible candidates who made more ambitious hints at a presidential run in the past year			0
a recent @entity1 / @entity124 poll showed @entity3 tied for fourth place with sen. @entity126 , @entity127 , with 6 % support in the hypothetical @entity10 horse race			2
@entity28 topped the list at 23 % , followed by @entity132 gov. @entity131 at 13 % and neurosurgeon @entity133 at 7 %			0
related : @entity3 ends @entity5 show to mull 2016 @entity3 , who served as the @entity17 governor for nearly 11 years , benefits by having strong name recognition , thanks in part to his 2008 campaign but largely because of his successful cable news show that 's kept him a mainstay in the conservative political dialogue for more than six years			1
popular among social conservatives , the @entity144 pastor 's prospects will likely have the biggest impact on sen. @entity147 of @entity148 and former sen. @entity149 of @entity150			0
both men are seriously considering 2016 campaigns and have strong appeal among socially conservative voters			0
@entity149 ultimately won the @entity51 caucuses in 2012 in a delayed vote count , though @entity157 carried the early momentum since he was initially declared the winner			1
@entity3 's announcements could speed up the timelines for @entity147 and @entity149 , given that they 'll be competing in the same donor pool â € ” a race , in many respects , that has already begun			1
it could also bring renewed attention in the race to social issues			0
but @entity3 could be considered a threat to the candidacies of 2016 hopefuls outside the social conservative wing of the party			0
@entity126 's political team was quick to pounce on @entity3 's announcement , buying ad space saturday on @entity178 and @entity179 so that links to @entity126 's website came up when people searched for @entity3 's name			2
they employed similar tactics when @entity28 announced his interest			0
and while having high name identification and an @entity51 win already under his belt can certainly be a boost , it does n't guarantee another round of success in the @entity42			2
@entity195 , for example , won the @entity51 caucuses in 1980 , but lost the contest in 1988			1
still , @entity28 went on to win the @entity10 nomination			0
" it 's not so easy because people are always looking for something new or they still want to be wooed , so to speak , " said @entity198 , professor of political science at the @entity200			0
" they still want you to come in and do the work			0
" @entity51 's caucus - going crowd is comprised of a three - pronged @entity10 base , made up not only by social conservatives but of mainstream @entity10 and libertarian - minded voters as well			2
@entity3 's success , @entity198 contends , will depend on who all gets in the race â € ” a move that no one , including the former @entity17 governor and now ex-tv host , has officially made yet			1
@entity1 's @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
