-- they are the little known @entity2 champions who have decimated the dream of @entity6 great @entity5			1
@entity12 , playing in @entity8 's @entity7 by virtue of @entity10 being hosts , will now face @entity15 champions @entity13 on saturday in a bid to be crowned the globe 's finest club team			1
they beat @entity21 's @entity20 3 - 1 in @entity22 to become only the second @entity24 side to make the showpiece final , and in the process deny @entity5 perhaps his last shot at landing the prestigious crown			1
the 33 - year - old has a host of titles to his name , including the 2002 @entity7 with @entity21 , and spoke of his desire to break into their squad before his home country host the next installment , in 2014			2
but though he got on the scoresheet with a brilliant , trademark free kick to level the game at 1 - 1 , his side could n't hold out and conceded two late goals			2
@entity5 was a losing finalist with @entity43 in 2006 and will now have to make do with a match against @entity46 champions @entity45 to determine who finishes third in the tournament that pits the champions of each continent against each other			0
the former @entity53 and @entity54 star is rumored to be leaving @entity55 when his contract runs out and could be a target for @entity59 club @entity58			0
when his curling free kick cannoned off the post and into the net just after the hour mark to make it 1 - 1 , @entity5 could be forgiven for dreaming of adding the @entity7 to his maiden @entity65 triumph with @entity55			2
it canceled out @entity12 's opener , scored when @entity68 drilled a low shot into the bottom corner from outside the penalty area			0
despite a flurry of pressure after they scored @entity55 then shot themselves in the foot as @entity77 brought down @entity68 inside the area , @entity79 converting from the spot			0
as @entity55 pressed hard for a second equalizer , @entity81 made the game safe to spark wild scenes of celebration in @entity22 in front of 35,000 fans			0
after spoiling @entity5 's night @entity12 will aim to do the same to @entity13 on saturday , as the @entity88 go for their fifth trophy of a remarkable year .			1
