as three tugboats towed the disabled @entity2 back to port in @entity4 , @entity5 , things went from bad to worse			2
the fire that caused the ship to lose power and drift aimlessly on rough @entity10 swells was just the beginning			2
raw sewage seeped into corridors and cabin ways			0
@entity15 had to be rationed			0
there were fears of looting			0
not surprisingly , passengers were furious and emotional			0
some were reported to be " acting like savages			0
" for carnival and the rest of the cruise line industry , the implications are potentially devastating			1
the deadly capsizing in january 2012 of the @entity28 ship off the coast of @entity30 still lingers in the public 's mind			0
about a month later , the @entity34 liner suffered a similar engine fire , lost power , and was set adrift in pirate - infested waters in the @entity38			0
carnival owns @entity40 , and now a third high - profile crisis for @entity39 in just over a year threatens to cement the perception among vacationers that cruising might not be worth the risk			1
five things we 've learned about cruises in the age of social and digital media , the problems faced by cruise lines are compounded			1
using mobile phones , passengers aboard the @entity53 have been providing concerned family members with constant updates			0
those enraged family members have immediately passed the horror stories along to the eager media			2
the public is getting the full play - by - play in virtual real time , leaving carnival playing catchup from an increasingly defensive posture			1
but as bad as the potential damage to @entity39 's image may be , the company , as well as the rest of the cruise line industry , has an opportunity to blunt the impact , if it acts quickly and wisely			1
it seems counterintuitive , but while the gruesome stories of the " cruise from hell " are still fresh , the crisis offers an opportunity for the cruise line to make a compelling statement about the industry 's commitment to its passengers			1
) crisis management experts know that customers and the general public are more likely to judge an organization by how it handles a problem than how it got into the problem in the first place			2
that means @entity39 has to go much further than mere reimbursements and vouchers for onward travel			1
the challenge to @entity39 's reputation is three-fold			1
first the company must articulate real concern for passengers and clearly communicate what it is doing to make things right for customers			1
this will require financial sacrifices , of course			0
but @entity39 has little choice but to pay now and win some badly needed goodwill -- or pay later in the courtroom , in the court of public opinion , and , of course , at the cash register when bookings decline			1
second , the company must clearly communicate what it is doing to fix the problem and prevent anything like it from ever happening again			2
how did an engine fire , serious as that might be , so quickly develop into a disaster of this magnitude ? my celebration trip on the @entity53 : from joy to misery how could it have been allowed to happen ? why was the widely reported chaos and disorder allowed to develop ? why did @entity39 not have emergency response plans in place ? what is the industry doing to prepare for what would seem to be a manageable situation ? the public will demand answers to these basic questions before it will begin to trust again			2
uncertainty breathes life into a crisis			0
accurate and timely information smothers it			0
third , @entity39 must aggressively and clearly deliver these messages now , and for as long as it takes to restore the public 's trust			1
so far , the story has been about the unthinkable conditions the passengers have been forced to endure			0
carnival must move aggressively to reshape that narrative to reflect all that it is doing to rectify the situation			0
after a bad cruise , can you cruise into court ? carnival has to resist the temptation to explain , minimize , or justify what happened and position itself instead as part of the solution to the problems that caused the disaster			1
that is what the public will focus on and remember , but only if @entity39 is able to communicate it fast and effectively .			2

@entity169 : for @entity39 , impact of ' cruise from hell ' potentially devastating .
passenger video , media puts @entity39 increasingly on the defensive , he says
he says it must show real concern , lay out plan , go a long way to make amends
do *n't* try to justify or explain , he says , but get *proactive* now about fixing problem
