@entity0 -- the federal government said it will recommend that new cars have rear - view video systems , a move immediately denounced as " insufficient " by safety groups who say the cameras should be mandatory			1
the camera and monitor system enables drivers to see whether people or objects are in the blind spot behind vehicles			0
the @entity16 said tuesday it will add the rear - view video systems to its list of recommended features under its @entity19 , designed to encourage car manufacturers to improve vehicle safety			1
but safety groups called the action a stalling tactic , saying the agency is dragging its feet in fulfilling a congressionally imposed deadline to issue a rule on rear visibility			1
passed in 2008 , the law had a 2011 deadline			0
the regulation is now two and a half years overdue			0
death toll from backover accidents grows the @entity16 action " is an inadequate substitute for issuing a mandatory safety regulation , " @entity35 , president of advocates for @entity37 and @entity38 , said in a statement			2
" in fact , safety advocates are concerned that @entity16 's announcement is an attempt to divert attention from their failure to act			0
" the @entity16 announcement tuesday came just one day before a group of safety advocates , including two parents who unintentionally hit their children while backing up , was expected to file suit against the @entity57 @entity56 , which includes @entity16			2
the suit is to be filed wednesday morning by @entity59 , who reportedly backed over his 2 - year - old son , @entity60 , in his driveway in 2002 , killing him , and by @entity62 , who backed over her 3 - year - old daughter , @entity63 , in her driveway in 2005 , injuring her			2
also joining in the suit will be the @entity68 of the @entity57 , advocates for @entity37 and @entity38 and @entity66 , those groups said in a statement			1
the lawsuit asks the court to direct the @entity56 to issue a mandatory rule within 90 days			2
rear - view camera systems are available on seven in 10 new vehicles , as either standard equipment or an option			1
but the safety groups say the government 's inaction has allowed the death toll in so - called " backover " accidents to grow			1
according to the @entity57 @entity56 , more than 200 people are killed and 17,000 injured every year in backover crashes , when drivers back up over unseen objects behind them			1
children under the age of 5 account for 44 % of the fatalities			0
in a high percentage of those cases , the motorist is a parent or family member			0
in december 2010 , @entity16 published a proposed rule and set out to meet a february 2011 deadline for enacting it			0
on - board cameras , @entity16 said at the time , could cut in half deaths and injuries due to backing crashes , at a cost of about $ 159 to $ 203 per vehicle , or about $ 1.9 billion to $ 2.7 billion a year for the nation 's 16.6 million fleet of new vehicles			2
( the price has since fallen , advocates say			0
) fatal wrecks underscore risks for young drivers but the @entity56 twice extended the deadline , first to december 2011 , and again to february 2012 , a deadline it has missed			0
the @entity56 said the extensions were necessary because of the " large volume of public comments and the complexity of some of the issues			0
" transportation secretary @entity119 said in a statement tuesday that he remains committed to implementing a new rear visibility rule			2
but adding rear - view systems to its list of recommended features " will encourage both automakers and consumers to consider more vehicles that offer this important technology			1
" @entity16 said it would include the video system into its @entity19 in two phases			0
starting immediately , the agency will begin identifying on www.safercar.gov vehicle models that have the video systems			1
next , as soon as the agency is able to verify that systems meet basic criteria , the agency will recognize those vehicles as having this recommended advanced technology feature on the website .			1

@entity57 agency recommends rear - view video systems on new cars
consumer groups argue that systems should be mandatory
technology helps *prevent* " backover " crashes
