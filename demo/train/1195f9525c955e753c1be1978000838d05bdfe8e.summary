editor 's note : on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity2 goes outside the @entity6 to report on the issues affecting communities across the country			1
@entity10 lives on a check of a little less than $ 17 a week and whatever he can pick up from odd jobs			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity5 ) -- the tiny one - room house rests on a hill ; no electricity and no running water			0
a creaky metal cot and a rusting wood - burning stove is all the comfort @entity10 says he needs			1
" all it is is logs , glue -- dirt and water put together -- then cement and the chicken string , " @entity10 says of his home			1
" long as the windows do n't break , it 's nice and warm in here			1
" the roof leaks a bit , and the floorboards are rotted in one corner , but @entity10 is n't one to complain			1
" it 's home , " he says , almost under his breath , as he invites a visitor to have a look			2
firewood is stacked in one corner inside , and more outside as @entity10 uses the summer months to stockpile for prairie winters , where 20 below zero is not all that uncommon			1
he also pulls bunches of long weeds in the prairie grass , to dry for use as a firestarter			0
" i have to be careful , " @entity10 says matter - of - factly as he pulls a few fistfuls			1
" sometimes there are some snakes			0
nothing to mess around with			0
" he is 54 years old , a member of the @entity58 tribe and part of two stunning statistics , even as communities across @entity63 deal with the pain and challenges of recession : @entity10 worked 16 years as a firefighter			1
but he began having some back problems in the early 1980s and then , " cancer caught up with me			0
i have a brain tumor			0
" he says he gets a check for just shy of $ 17 every week from a tribal welfare fund , and tries to find odd jobs to pay for his food and to help out a diabetic sister			1
but there 's a catch : tiny @entity78 has no such jobs			1
there are one or two one - room homes like @entity10 's , but it is mostly a collection of a couple dozen simple modular homes provided by a federal and tribal housing program			1
it does n't even have a gas station or general store			2
so @entity10 heads out most days toward @entity89 -- 17 miles up one road and then 21 miles more up the next			1
a few more twists and , " it 's about 42 to 43 miles , someplace around there			2
" @entity10 ca n't afford a car			1
" well , i take off , go to my sister 's , then get some water and take off			2
somebody along the way will pick me up			0
" often , that somebody is @entity99 , a member of the tribal council whose district includes @entity78			1
" it is bad , " he says of the area 's economic plight , walking a visitor through the gravel streets where many residents , idle because of the lack of jobs , are sitting out front or shout out a greeting from inside their small homes			1
to spend a day crossing the reservation is to see a place stunningly beautiful and seemingly forgotten all at once , small , poor communities tucked into the hollows of western @entity14 's @entity118			1
the poverty is all the more striking because of the richness of the setting : green and golden rolling hills , roaming horses and cattle , and tall corn and golden sunflowers sprouting from the fertile soil			2
" @entity129 is the no. 1 county statistically with child poverty , " he said			1
" now that alone is generational , with the trauma of poverty and the broken family			2
" breaking that cycle is @entity136 ' obsession			0
he highlights a bright spot : a building in the community converted to a makeshift classroom and library where residents can get tutoring help and then take the @entity145 --- the high school equivalency exam			2
" it is so difficult , " he says of the challenge facing younger reservation residents			1
" some of our young people join the services , the armed services , some of them go to college or apply to college , " @entity99 told us			0
" the majority , if they are staying here , end up moving to @entity160 or some of the bigger cities to try to find employment			2
" in @entity89 , the largest community on the reservation , a bustling construction site is a new source of pride			2
a medical center is under construction , thanks to funding from the @entity174 administration 's stimulus plan , and @entity175 says about 65 construction - related jobs so far have gone to tribal members			1
" at this point i am very appreciative of what we have received , " @entity178 , the elected tribal chairman , says when we ask if the stimulus funding is enough			2
" but as far as expectation , i can say no. there would be a lot more need to be fulfilled by the @entity63 government for our tribe before i can say yes			2
" outside , @entity178 's office is a " @entity193 " sign -- a reminder the tribe was an early backer of @entity174			1
@entity178 says he hopes the president remembers			0
" i can sympathize , empathize , with the demands , with the pressures that are on his shoulders , on his plate and put in front of him , " @entity178 said during a break from a @entity197 meeting			0
the biggest help @entity174 and @entity207 could give , the chairman and others told us , is greater water rights			0
the tribe has money for more housing , but ca n't build because the water pressure is too low and its treatment systems too outdated to handle increased demand			1
" i feel that we are forgotten because we do n't have that voice out there , " chairman @entity178 said			2
" it 's demoralizing in a way for some of our members that go out and receive an education and come back and are unable to get a job here			2
" to be clear , chairman @entity178 and @entity227 say not all of the tribe 's problems rest with the federal government			1
both mentioned obstacles and disagreements born of factional tribal politics and rivalries , which were in full evidence during just a few minutes of the @entity197 's debate			1
in the @entity136 is also a strong advocate for land reforms he says would get the tribe a better deal for grazing rights on its property			2
still , they would welcome more economic development help , from the state and from @entity249 , but say their voices do n't always get heard , even in the best of times			2
" when it comes down to a vote , a lot of the urban representatives , i do n't think they really know the plight on the reservation , " @entity253 said			1
" i think there is a stereotype out there that all tribes have casinos and that 's not true			2
" @entity10 shrugs when asked if @entity249 has a responsibility to help his struggling community			1
" i ca n't really say , " he said quietly			0
" i 'm not into politics to tell you the truth			0
i was when i was younger , back in the ' 80s			0
" now , he lives the simplest of lives			0
a few hours of work if he is lucky , and perhaps an hour or two collecting wood , even in the scorching august sun. the temperature neared 100 degrees on the day of our visit , yet @entity10 's wood stove was warm to the touch			1
prairie mornings can still be chilly			0
more important , memories of winter 's past remind @entity10 of the value of his growing stockpile			1
" sometimes it 's a long walk , " he says			0
twenty below and i have to walk			0
often no cars ... a few times i felt like falling asleep on the road			0
i told myself , ' fall asleep , you 're froze and you 're gone			0
' i pushed myself to keep walking			0
" once home , he has a battery - powered radio and uses a small kerosene lamp to pass time at night reading			0
he 's extra careful because he recently broke its glass chimney , so the flame burns without protection from the winds that can pick up suddenly			0
@entity10 's worries are more immediate than whether the president or any other politician understands his plight			1
" they never stopped up here , " he says			0
" if they did , i was n't home			0
" on the odd jobs in town , $ 1 here and $ 5 there adds up -- not too much , but his goals are modest			1
" you know , take the trash out			0
a few dollars a day would n't hurt			0
that 's as good as you need			0
that 's all i care about			0
one day at a time			0
