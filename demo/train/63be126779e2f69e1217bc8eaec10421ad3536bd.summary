@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 hops into a van , rubs his hands together and signals the passengers to quiet down			1
as he leans back to address them , his face breaks into a grin , his teeth glistening in the dawn haze			2
" today , we say goodbye to the north , " he says as young men and women cheer , peeking through woolen scarves and hats			1
@entity3 is among about 70 @entity18 natives gathered on a cold morning in a church parking lot in @entity20 , @entity21 , a metro @entity22 enclave popular with refugees			1
the group is heading to @entity0 to vote in a referendum that could split @entity18 into two : the north and the south			1
several million people in @entity18 are voting this week in the historic referendum on whether to declare independence from a government based in the north			1
about 55,000 southern @entity33 are casting ballots in the @entity35 and seven other countries			1
@entity3 drives in a convoy of more than a dozen cars			0
as it snakes out of the parking lot , some passengers sing a song by former guerrilla fighters who now lead the government and army of semi-autonomous @entity18			1
" we will never surrender ; we will keep fighting until we get what we want , " they sing in @entity48 , the national language			0
at the end of the song , they pump their fists in the air and chant : " yes to separation ! " the referendum is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end two decades of civil war , which left about 2 million dead			1
the war pitted a government dominated by @entity64 in northern @entity18 against black @entity65 or animists in the south			1
for @entity3 , the referendum is more of reparation			2
he 's one of the so - called @entity69 : a generation of children who fled the nation 's civil war and are now scattered across several continents			0
the @entity35 resettled nearly 4,000 of them about a decade ago			1
the men -- now mostly in their 20s and 30s -- have spent the past decade rebuilding their lives			0
the war forced @entity3 and others to trek hundreds of miles through deserts and swamps , fending off lions and other animals , during their journeys into neighboring countries			2
once there , they lived in sprawling refugee camps for years			0
@entity3 , 32 , says he has been dreaming of the referendum for years			2
" it 's time for them to hear our voices , for us to revolt against all the pain we suffered , " the graduate student says			0
" a lot of people have died for this day			0
... i do n't care what government comes after this			0
no government will be worse than what we have			0
" his voice trails off as he pauses and stares into space			0
" passing this referendum means my father did not die in vain			2
it means our children will not live scarred lives			0
... we will be the last ' lost boys ' @entity18 will ever see			1
" the conflict scarred an entire generation in remote @entity18 , which is the size of @entity121 but only has 30 miles of paved roads			1
through the years , hundreds of thousands of @entity33 fled the south to escape fighting and famine			1
about 80 percent of @entity18 's oil reserves are in the south , another flash point in the war			1
although the north has flourished , the south has not changed much over the years , according to @entity3			1
" this north claims they want to be one nation , " he says			2
" how can we be when they have schools and clean water , and their children are not dying of simple diseases ? in the south , people still drink stagnant water			2
" passengers chime in to add to the list of grievances with the north			2
some cite the north 's attempts to impose sharia , or @entity153 law , on non-muslims -- a key reason the nation erupted in civil war in 1983			2
@entity158 remains the law of the land in northern @entity18			1
" you see my hair			0
it would get me in trouble in the north because of sharia law , " says @entity164 , a bakery employee , as she points to her red cornrows			2
" i want my children to walk out of the house without being forced to cover their hair , to wear what they want , to go to church without being forced to convert to @entity153			0
" @entity33 president @entity175 has warned that he will tighten the application of sharia in northern @entity18 if @entity18 votes for independence			1
everyone in the vans believes that the south will split from the north			1
any attempt to introduce a different scenario is brushed off as negativity			0
@entity164 is admonished when she says she will " never " go back to @entity18 if @entity175 does not honor a vote to split			1
" how can ( @entity175 ) not honor the vote when the whole world is watching ? " @entity189 , 25 , shoots back			2
" you need to stop your negative thinking			0
" @entity3 says he will move home if @entity18 is reborn as a new nation			1
" when i graduate , i 'll thank the @entity35 for being kind to us , and go help my people , " he says			1
after about four hours , the convoy pulls up at the @entity197 , a one - story red brick building just south of the office towers of downtown @entity0			1
the center is one of eight polling stations across the @entity35 that will be open until saturday			1
more than 900 southern @entity33 are registered to vote there , poll officials say			1
other centers are in @entity206 ; @entity207 ; @entity208 ; @entity209 , @entity210 ; @entity211 ; @entity212 and @entity213			0
the vote is being organized by the @entity215			2
outside the @entity0 center , a crowd awaits			1
some are dancing while others wave @entity35 and @entity18 flags			1
at the front of the line , @entity221 , 42 , of @entity0 waits for his chance to vote , weeping quietly			1
" my crying is not for sadness ; it 's for happiness , " he says			0
" i never knew i would vote for this separation in my lifetime			2
we have been slaves for so long			0
we are now being liberated			0
" outside , @entity231 , 42 , a musician from @entity18 who traveled from @entity232 to vote , is busy ripping up his @entity33 passport			1
the crowd claps and cheers as the pages flutter into the windy , wintry air			0
" this passport has enslaved me for so long , " he says			0
" it has treated me like a second - class citizen , destroyed my dignity , and killed and separated my family			0
" the musician says he has been targeted by the northern government for criticizing it			0
" but ( the truth ) needs to be told , regardless of whether it will set us on fire			0
" @entity231 saunters into a waiting van and drives off , leaving shredded pieces of his passport outside the polling station			0
inside , @entity3 casts his vote and triumphantly holds up his ink - stained finger for flashing cameras			2
" bye bye , @entity158 law ; bye bye , slavery , " he says			0
" now ( the north ) should leave us alone , and we 'll leave them alone			2
we ca n't be one nation , but we 'll be good neighbors			0
" he makes his way out to the waiting vans			0
and in an unconscious defiance of the government he wants no part of , he steps over the pale green and pink passport pages scattered outside .			0
