-- @entity3 is " skating very close to a dangerous line " after weeks of saber - rattling , @entity2 defense secretary @entity1 warned wednesday as northeast @entity6 watched for an expected missile test			1
" their actions and their words have not helped defuse a combustible situation , " @entity8 told reporters at the @entity10			1
he said the @entity2 and its allies want to see @entity3 rhetoric " ratcheted down , " but if that does n't happen , " our country is fully prepared to deal with any contingency			1
" " we have every capacity to deal with any action @entity3 will take to protect this country and the interests of this country and our allies , " @entity8 said			1
@entity2 radar and satellites are trained on the east coast of the @entity33 , where the communist government of @entity35 is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for launch at any time , @entity2 and @entity29 officials warned			1
@entity41 has deployed missile defense systems around @entity43 , some @entity40 tour groups have canceled visits to @entity3 and the top @entity2 commander in the @entity46 said tuesday that he could n't recall a time of greater tension in the region since the end of the @entity52 in the 1950s			1
@entity53 to @entity55 leaders : ' we 're in deep doo - doo ' on @entity3 since december , @entity3 has put a satellite in orbit atop a long - range rocket ; conducted a nuclear bomb test , its third since 2006 ; and claimed to be prepared for pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the @entity2 , though most analysts believe it does not yet have that capability			1
the north has given ample warning to the world before previous long - range rocket launches -- but it is keeping everyone guessing about what it might do this time around			1
intelligence suggests that @entity3 may be planning " multiple missile launches " in the coming days beyond two @entity76 mobile missiles it has placed along its east coast , @entity10 officials told @entity0			1
the officials did not have specifics on the numbers of other missiles and launchers			0
one official said the @entity3 are military " masters of deception , " and may have planned all along to focus the world 's attention on the @entity87 while they plan multiple launches of other missiles			1
that 's a tactic they have used in the past , the official said			0
the @entity2 is less troubled about the other missiles , a second @entity10 official told @entity0			1
" we 've been seeing some launchers moving around			0
these are smaller and do n't cause us as much concerns , " that official said			0
" we think these movements are within seasonal norms for their exercises			0
" but he did n't discount the possibility that they might launch some of those , as they often do			0
the @entity76 is an untested weapon that @entity29 says has a range as far as 3,500 kilometers ( 2,175 miles )			0
that would mean it could reach as far as @entity113 , a @entity46 territory that is home to @entity2 naval and air bases and where the @entity2 recently said it was placing missile defense systems			2
after a launch , @entity2 satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as @entity41			1
the @entity2 and @entity41 would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down , @entity2 officials say			2
@entity130 foreign minister @entity129 on wednesday told @entity0 that despite being an ally of @entity3 , it stands with the @entity2			1
" on @entity3 , we have no differences with the @entity2			1
one just should n't scare anyone with military maneuvers and there 's a chance things might calm down , " he said			0
@entity2 , @entity3 officials met secretly in march a launch without warning ? @entity29 foreign minister @entity145 said at a parliamentary hearing wednesday that " according to intelligence obtained by our side and the @entity2 , the possibility of a missile launch by @entity3 is very high , " the semiofficial @entity29 news agency @entity144 reported			1
@entity145 said he was basing his assessment on @entity29 and @entity2 intelligence			1
on tuesday , a @entity2 official said that the @entity2 government believes a test launch could happen at any time and without @entity3 issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping that would warn planes and vessels to stay away from the missile 's path			1
the official , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information , cautioned that most of the information comes from satellite imagery , so it 's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the @entity2 can not gather information on the ground			1
he said the launch could be " imminent " but also cautioned that the @entity2 " simply does n't know			2
" based on what the @entity2 has seen , the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch			2
speaking at a @entity182 hearing tuesday , @entity180 said the @entity2 military would not want to shoot down a @entity3 missile whose trajectory would send it into the open sea			1
but he said if a missile 's path appeared to threaten a @entity2 ally , such as @entity41 , interceptor missiles could be used to try to bring it down			2
@entity41 poised to react ' calmly ' @entity41 's deployment of missile defenses in @entity43 follows similar measures taken ahead of the @entity3 's rocket launches last year			1
prime minister @entity196 told reporters tuesday that his government would do " calmly " whatever needed to be done to protect its population			0
in a sign of the level of concern , however , the port city of @entity201 had to apologize for prematurely publishing a warning of a missile launch on the @entity208 page of its emergency management agency			0
the tweet was up for about 20 minutes before being removed			0
the agency said that the misleading tweet was caused by human error and that it would work on changing its system to prevent the problem from happening again			0
since the @entity217 voted last month to impose new sanctions on @entity35 's regime over the latest @entity3 nuclear test , @entity216 has kept up a steady flow of words and acts that could give the impression of a nation heading inexorably toward conflict			1
on tuesday , it advised foreigners in @entity29 to secure shelter or evacuate the country in case of hostilities on the @entity33 , the latest in a string of ominous warnings			0
it also kept more than 50,000 of its workers from an industrial complex jointly operated with @entity29 , which had been a key symbol of cooperation between the two countries			0
@entity3 's war of words escalates : a timeline of the crisis ' @entity245 ' inside @entity3 but on the same day , state media published articles that described festive events and international visits , suggesting a much less fraught situation inside @entity3			1
the state - run @entity251 ( @entity251 ) reported that various sporting events were happening or scheduled to take place to mark the 101st anniversary next week of the birth of @entity256 , the founder of @entity3 and the grandfather of @entity35			1
" the ongoing sports tournaments make the country seethe with holiday atmosphere , " @entity251 said			0
@entity256 's birthday , known as the @entity262 , is a major public holiday in @entity3			2
the planned events include an international marathon sunday in @entity216 in which runners from @entity3 and other countries will participate			2
@entity251 also noted tuesday the arrival by plane in @entity3 of a delegation from the @entity41 - @entity271			2
such visits sit strangely alongside the @entity3 's warning last week to foreign diplomats in @entity216 that it would n't be able to guarantee their safety in the event of a conflict			1
some @entity3 watchers have observed that the regime 's domestic propaganda has focused recently on efforts to promote economic development , while the bellicose threats appear targeted primarily at a foreign audience			1
@entity3 's missile capabilities varying levels of concern the angry rhetoric has also failed to alarm @entity29 , who have lived through decades of @entity3 bombast			2
residents of @entity293 have continued to go unflappably about their daily business			0
" @entity29 has been living under such threats from the past , and we are always prepared for it , " @entity29 unification minister @entity295 told @entity0 on wednesday			0
he called the current climate " a very ordinary situation			0
" " @entity3 may launch missiles at any time , and our military is fully prepared for it , " he said			2
but the @entity3 's fiery words appear to have had an effect on the @entity2 public , with 41 % of those surveyed saying they see the reclusive nation as an immediate threat to the @entity2 , according to a recent @entity0 / @entity311 poll			1
that 's up 13 percentage points in less than a month , @entity0 polling director @entity312 said			0
" if @entity3 leader @entity35 wanted to get the attention of the @entity2 public , his strategy is starting to work , " @entity312 said			1
@entity319 , a professor of history at @entity321 in @entity293 , noted the varying levels of concern in an opinion article for the @entity325 published tuesday			0
" the farther one is from the @entity33 , the more one will find people worried about the recent developments here , " he said			0
the tense situation does appear to have prompted some @entity40 tour groups to call off upcoming trips to @entity3			2
@entity333 , a spokesman for the @entity334 , said wednesday that some agencies and tourists had canceled plans , but he said the @entity40 - @entity3 border continued to operate normally			2
western tourism agencies that organize visits to @entity3 have n't so far reported any changes to their activities			2
@entity343 : tensions high at knife - edge of korean conflict a troubled industrial zone the most tangible signs of disruption are in the @entity350 , the manufacturing zone on the @entity3 side of the border where more than 120 @entity29 companies operate			2
last week , the @entity3 started blocking @entity29 personnel from crossing the border back into the complex			0
and this week , it said it was pulling out the more than 50,000 @entity3 who work inside the zone and temporarily suspending activities there			0
it had blocked the border crossing previously , in 2009 , but pulling out the workers was a new step			0
as of wednesday lunchtime , only a few hundred @entity29 remained inside the complex , according to @entity29 authorities , down from more than 800 before the @entity3 started restricting entry			0
also on wednesday , @entity29 accused the @entity3 of carrying out a wave of cyberattacks that paralyzed the networks of major @entity29 banks and broadcasters last month			0
it is the first time that @entity293 has formally pointed the finger at @entity216 for the hacking , which affected more than 48,000 computers			0
@entity0 's @entity386 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 , @entity382 , @entity383 , @entity384 and @entity385 contributed to this report .			0
