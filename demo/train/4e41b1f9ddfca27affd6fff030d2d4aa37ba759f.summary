it starts with a tweet			0
the recruit has been slowly and carefully chosen from his local community -- perhaps at a mosque , or gym , or cafe -- by an @entity8 recruiter , aiming to send a westerner to fight alongside radicals in @entity11			1
according to a defector from the ranks of the @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity11 ( @entity16 ) -- whose stronghold in the @entity11 town of @entity19 punishes smokers and insists women wear a veil -- the jihadist group runs a series of internet welcome chat groups to begin the process of indoctrinating and filtering potential recruits from outside @entity11			1
the defector agreed to an interview with @entity30 but wanted to hide his identity , but his story was ratified by a witness and his extensive knowledge of life inside @entity11 under the @entity16			1
he fled @entity11 when two of his relatives were killed in the violence , and is now hiding in @entity39			0
he said that @entity41 recruits were more sought after and treated in a different class by the recruiters			0
" there was special treatment for the @entity41 , " he says			0
" one @entity47 guy said he was called @entity48 , then told me he was from @entity49			0
one asked my emir [ his unit 's head ] if he should fight in his own country , or come to @entity11			2
he was told if @entity54 does n't give you martyrdom in @entity11 , then he could wage war in his own country			0
" @entity59 officials have told @entity30 they are deeply concerned at not only the growing numbers of @entity59 passport holders who have traveled to @entity11 to fight , but also the potential for more and more of these radicals to return to the @entity65 and continue that jihad through acts of domestic terrorism			1
hundreds of @entity47 and @entity70 citizens have traveled to @entity11 , according to multiple official estimates , and several have returned			0
a briton was recently convicted of terror offenses after spending time inside @entity11 with radical groups			0
@entity76 officials have become increasingly concerned about @entity76 passport holders attempting the same , and anxieties have been amplified by the @entity79 confirming that @entity80 , from @entity81 , became the first @entity76 citizen to die as a suicide bomber in @entity11 last month			2
recruiters are the gateway from the @entity65 to @entity16			0
the first contact is made over @entity88 , when the recruit might send a message to @entity16 's @entity88 accounts saying " can i talk to @entity91 , " for example , the source said			1
the @entity88 account is then followed back , enabling a direct message to be sent with the e-mail address of the @entity16 recruiter			1
the conversations that continue , the defector said , over @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity88 , are extensively monitored by the emirs and supervisors of the recruiting unit			1
while the defector did n't speak @entity106 , he says he used online translating apps to talk to @entity70 and @entity106 recruits			2
" there are questions i am allowed to answer , " he said , " and then things i must ask my supervisor			0
i have to get their permission to message anyone			0
i ca n't talk on @entity100 , as everything is written down , so they can monitor everything			1
" the defector added his supervisor often dealt with the @entity41 recruits			2
he said the online chats , intended to provide basic information about life under the @entity16 caliphate , or strict @entity128 state , lasted about two weeks , and sometimes each chat could last hours			1
he said some of the potential recruits asked curious questions			2
" i remember one guy asked me for a video of a public execution " , he said , " but one that 's not been put online before			1
strange ones too about marrying @entity11 girls			0
i got mad once when i was asked if someone could marry three or four girls			2
" when the recruit is ready to come to @entity11 , a different part of @entity16 assists , and the defector said he was not supposed to meet those he helped recruit			1
he said the recruitment was first aimed at filling @entity16 ranks inside @entity11 , and that the return of these radicals to their home countries was carefully regulated by the emirs , or senior commanders , of @entity16			1
each recruit 's passport was taken from him on arrival and the defector recalls seeing dozens of foreign passports held in the same office , and overhearing one foreign recruit discussing how he might return home to act as a recruiter			1
the defector was himself jailed for one day by @entity16 for overstepping the permitted topics of conversation with recruits , and says he fled @entity11 with the clothes on his back after his relatives were killed			2
he says he still fears for his life and has given his phone number to only three people			0
" i did n't think @entity16 lied to me , " he says , " but they did play with my mind			0

@entity128 defector says @entity88 , @entity99 and @entity100 used to recruit foreign fighters
@entity59 is concerned foreign fighters will return to home countries with terrorist plots
@entity181 says foreign fighters are recruited over weeks
he says one recruit wanted to see an execution video ; others asked about marriage
