-- federal safety investigators cast new concerns about using lithium - ion batteries to power systems on commercial aircraft , saying they should be put through rigorous tests that produce " the most severe outcomes " before being approved for use in the skies			1
the @entity10 issued the recommendations on thursday as it continues to investigate lithium - ion batteries on @entity12			1
two batteries on those aircraft self - combusted on planes last year			1
the @entity16 and @entity12 have vouched for the safety of the @entity19 's re-designed battery system			1
and the @entity10 said those changes are consistent with its new recommendations			1
but the safety board said the @entity16 needs to revise its 2008 battery standards for all aircraft , which remain in effect			1
batteries should be tested in conditions that closely resemble the conditions on planes , the safety board said			1
they should undergo " abuse tests " in which cells are intentionally damaged			0
and they should be tested in ways that produce " the most severe outcomes			0
" such tests can show whether the batteries experience thermal runaway , an uncontrollable increase in temperature and pressure that can spread -- or cascade -- to adjacent cells			2
thermal runaways typically result in smoke , a known concern when the @entity16 approved the @entity19 battery			2
but smoke events were thought to be rare , and engineers designed ways to vent the smoke			0
but one witness to a dreamliner battery incident described " heavy smoke , " a small , 3 - inch flame coming from the battery case and material spewing out like molten wax aircraft manufacturers need to ensure that systems protect " against all adverse effects			2
" " the @entity10 is vitally interested in these recommendations because they are designed to prevent accidents and save lives , " the board wrote in a letter to @entity16 administrator @entity64			1
the @entity19 is the first large commercial aircraft to use permanently installed lithium - ion batteries as it main battery and for its auxiliary power unit , or @entity74			1
the batteries are valued because they are small , lightweight and powerful			0
the @entity10 says that in seeking certification of its batteries , @entity12 and battery manufacturer @entity79 of @entity81 , estimated that a " smoke " event would occur " less than once in 10 million flight hours			1
" but after 51,662 hours of commercial flight , two batteries failed , one culminating in a fire			0
in the first incident , a maintenance worker entered the aft electronics bay of @entity19 parked at @entity93 airport on january 7 , 2013 , and found heavy smoke and a small 3 - inch flame coming from the battery housing			2
the lithium - ion battery provided electricity to the plane 's auxiliary power unit , or @entity74			1
while the incident is still under investigation , he @entity10 said a short circuit in one of the battery 's eight cells resulted in a thermal runaway , and damage spread to adjacent cells			2
nine days later , the main battery on an @entity110 failed during a flight over @entity81			0
no fire was observed , and damage was confined to the battery housing			0
" this type of failure was not expected based on the testing and analysis ...			0
that @entity12 performed as part of the 787 certification process , " the @entity10 wrote			2
in a 2006 test , the battery manufacturer drove a steel nail into one of the battery 's eight cells to induce an internal short circuit , to see if the damage would result in smoke , fire and damage to the battery case			0
damaged cells emitted smoke , the test showed , but the smoke could effectively be handled by the airplane 's ventilation system			0
the @entity16 and @entity12 said they believed at the time that thermal runaway could only occur if a cell or battery was overcharged			2
so they took precautions to protect against overcharging , and adopted measures to vent smoke			0
@entity12 had considered the potential that a short circuit of a single cell would generate smoke , but it " underestimated " the effects of a thermal runaway			0
the safety board said it is concerned about the repeatability of tests that induce thermal runaways in batteries , and said researchers have found that current test methods " might not reliably produce failure effects as severe as those observed " in the real - world failures			1
@entity165 shorts , the safety board said , are hard to reproduce			1
but it is important to solve to improve safety , it said			0
a safety board spokesman told @entity0 the board could make more recommendations when it issues its final report , likely later this year			1
another battery incident troubles @entity12 's @entity175 @entity12 announces changes to @entity19 battery system aviation authorities find no big problems at @entity19 's battery maker			0

the @entity10 is investigating lithium - ion batteries on @entity183
its new recommendations follow battery fires on 787s last year
the safety board says the @entity16 needs to revise current standards on batteries
