-- judging by the dust on the label , the bottle has n't been handled for years , yet it feels warm to touch			0
perhaps that 's because it 's part of a wine collection that i 'm told belongs to @entity9 president @entity8 and my palms are perspiring			1
turning slowly , i half expect to be confronted by a bare - chested man in a judo stance , demanding to know what i 'm doing with his vino			2
i 'm imagining things , of course			0
@entity8 has more pressing matters to attend to than skulking around in catacombs in @entity19			1
i 'm in the state - owned @entity21 wine cellar , deep beneath the hills outside @entity23 , the capital			1
my paranoia is n't quite as foolish as it sounds -- @entity8 reportedly celebrated his 50th birthday right here			0
@entity19 , @entity26 's least - visited country , is separated from @entity9 by @entity27 -- although since the recent annexation of the @entity29 , it feels a lot closer			1
it certainly holds this complex little country 's fortunes in its hand			2
last year , when @entity9 ceased importing @entity19 wine because it said trace contaminants had been discovered , some said the move was really an expression of displeasure at @entity42 expansion			1
the countryside is covered by vineyards and @entity19 produces some of the world 's best wines , although you would n't know it looking at stockists in many parts of the planet			1
@entity54 's @entity53 was a fan , partial to a bottle of @entity56			2
@entity58 labyrinth the limestone labyrinth i 'm standing in is one of the planet 's biggest cellars			0
@entity21 's tunnels are vast wine - filled wormholes that extend for anywhere between 60 and 120 kilometers ( 37 and 74 miles ) , depending on who you believe			1
they 're so huge i 'm exploring them in a van			0
oceans of splendid sparkling white are made in this subterranean wine city using @entity76 's celebrated @entity75 , and conditions are perfect for storing all varietals			1
@entity8 is n't the only person to have a private stash here			0
i spy a collection labeled as belonging to @entity84 chancellor @entity83			0
there 's also a priceless group of bottles accumulated by @entity88 , including a 1902 @entity90 dessert wine			2
the @entity93 commander 's ill - gotten hoard was liberated by the @entity94 at the end of @entity96 and brought here			2
@entity19 sees only a few thousand visitors annually , with @entity21 among popular destinations			1
there have been some illustrious guests -- including @entity102 cosmonaut @entity101 , whose sampling tour reputedly lasted two days			0
@entity104 clearly does n't keep the country afloat , but wine sales do , which is why the @entity9 embargo causes such concern			1
@entity19 might be commercially dependent on @entity9 , but culturally the country looks west , to @entity110			1
@entity110 and @entity19 were unified for several decades in the first half of the 20th century and share a common language			1
@entity113 opposes a reunion , however , preferring to keep a meek and weak @entity19 on its doorstep than have to contend with a bigger , emboldened @entity110 with close ties to the @entity42			1
@entity117 and political arm wrestling on my next stop -- @entity125 , to @entity19 's east , sandwiched between the @entity122 and the @entity27 border -- this complicated cultural and political arm wrestle gets even stickier			1
border crossings are rarely fun , but the uniformed individual in the bleak hut straddling the line between @entity19 and @entity125 takes officiousness to a new level			1
finally , though , he stamps my form and i 'm in			0
exactly where i have got " in " to , however , is a point of contention			0
@entity125 is a nation in its own eyes only -- no other country officially recognizes it			2
for all its solemn theatrics , the grilling i 've just experienced was geopolitically meaningless and i 'm still in @entity19			2
culturally , though , everything has changed ; i 've crossed a line from a @entity143 - leaning land onto @entity145 soil			0
many @entity146 speak @entity9 and look more toward @entity113 than @entity23			2
now that parts of @entity27 have voted to cede to @entity9 control , people are pondering the possibility that @entity125 might be next on @entity8 's wish list			1
@entity125 : country roads the territory has a defiantly independent attitude			2
it has its own army and a currency you 'd be pushed to spend anywhere else on the planet			0
the local soccer team , @entity161 ( started by a @entity163 agent and sponsored by a supermarket ) regards itself as the national squad			0
given the @entity168 posturing at the border , it should n't have been a surprise when , at the @entity173 in @entity174 , on the banks of the @entity122 , i come face to face with @entity175			0
the @entity175 -- a @entity84 nobleman in real life , who became a captain in the @entity9 army -- was famous for his tall tales long before ex-python - turned - director @entity180 immortalized him on film in 1988			1
a renowned raconteur , @entity175 once claimed to have flown over @entity173 riding a cannonball during a battle with the @entity185			0
in a monumental salute to his overactive imagination , he has been cast in statue form just outside the fortress walls next to the saddled projectile he supposedly rode			0
less amusingly , the fortress also features a hideous torture chamber whose thick walls must have absorbed the screams of many unfortunates as control of the 15th - century fortress bounced back and forth between the @entity9 and @entity200 empires			1
i 'm glad to escape and thankful for the fresh air as we drive back across the @entity122 and through the bucolic countryside that sprawls across @entity19 and @entity125 , where people still live the kind of rural life that 's mostly extinct elsewhere in @entity26			1
wine - making monks we pull up outside @entity209 , a monastery that was shut down by the @entity102 in 1962 and transformed into a hospital			1
the monks moved back in shortly before @entity19 became independent in 1991 and , in between prayers , they 've been busy producing barrels of wine ever since			1
here , from the top of the region 's highest bell tower , i get an eyeful of the surrounding farmland , where donkeys pull cartloads of fresh vegetables past vineyards , and people congregate around wells at crossroads			1
i 'm shown around by a charismatic monk called @entity227			0
he tells me how the @entity102 cut the bell ropes in the tower , but when they tried to pull down one of the crucifixes with a tractor , it fell and killed the driver , so they left the rest standing			0
my tour finishes in the wine cellar , where we sample a glass of red straight from the barrel			1
@entity125 , though , is more famous for its fabulously smooth brandy , made in the regional capital by the @entity245 and @entity246 , otherwise known as @entity247			2
in @entity248 , i combine a shopping quest to acquire a bottle of brandy with some urban exploration and discover a highly eccentric city with a distinctly @entity102 aura			0
uniformed guards rebuke me for photographing official buildings			0
in the absence of playgrounds , kids climb on decommissioned @entity9 battle tanks ceremoniously parked in public spaces			2
clutching my @entity247 i stand in the street , under the stern gaze of one of several statues of @entity266			0
this bottle , unlike the ones in @entity8 's rack , is mine -- bought and paid for			0
@entity272 is a writer , photographer and editor who specializes in adventures on the darkside			0
he tweets at @ @entity277			0

@entity19 's state - owned @entity21 wine cellar houses private collections belonging to prominent figures
@entity21 's tunnels are vast , wine - filled wormholes that extend between 60 and 120 kilometers
people in the *breakaway* region of @entity125 look toward @entity9 while @entity19 *typically* lean toward @entity110
