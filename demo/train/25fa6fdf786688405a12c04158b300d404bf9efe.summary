there is no precedent in contemporary weather records for the kinds of droughts the country 's @entity2 will face , if greenhouse gas emissions stay on course , a @entity1 study said			1
no precedent even in the past 1,000 years			0
the feared droughts would cover most of the western half of the @entity15 -- the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
those regions have suffered severe drought in recent years			1
but it does n't compare in the slightest to the ' megadroughts ' likely to hit them before the century is over due to global warming			1
these will be epochal , worthy of a chapter in @entity29 's natural history			2
even if emissions drop moderately , droughts in those regions will get much worse than they are now , @entity1 said			1
the space agency 's study conjures visions of the sun scorching cracked earth that is baked dry of moisture for feet below the surface , across vast landscapes , for decades			1
great lake reservoirs could dwindle to ponds , leaving cities to ration water to residents who have n't fled east			2
" our projections for what we are seeing is that , with climate change , many of these types of droughts will likely last for 20 , 30 , even 40 years , " said @entity1 climate scientist @entity46			1
that 's worse and longer than the historic @entity55 of the 1930s , when " black blizzards " -- towering , blustery dust walls -- buried @entity58 homes , buggies and barns in dirt dunes			2
it lasted about 10 years			0
though long , it was within the framework of a contemporary natural drought			2
to find something almost as extreme as what looms , one must go back to @entity71			0
nestled in the shade of @entity76 mountain rock , earthen @entity73 housing offers a foreshadowing			0
the tight , lively villages emptied out in the 13th century 's @entity79 that lasted more than 30 years			2
starvation drove populations out to the east and south			0
if @entity1 's worst case scenario plays out , what 's to come could be worse			1
its computations are based on greenhouse gas emissions continuing on their current course			1
and they produce an 80 % chance of at least one drought that could last for decades			1
one " even exceeding the duration of the long term intense ' megadroughts ' that characterized the really arid time period known as the @entity100 , " @entity46 said			0
that was a period of heightened global temperatures that lasted from about 1100 to 1300 -- when those @entity103 dispersed			0
global average temperatures are already higher now than they were then , the study said			0
the @entity1 team 's study was very data heavy			1
it examined past wet and dry periods using tree rings going back 1,000 years and compared them with soil moisture from 17 climate models , @entity1 said in the study published in @entity115			1
scientists used super computers to calculate the models forward along the lines of human induced global warming scenarios			0
the models all showed a much drier planet			0
some @entity76 areas that are currently drought - stricken are filling up with more people , creating more demand for water while reservoirs are already strained			2
the predicted megadroughts will wrack water supplies much harder , @entity128 said			0
" these droughts really represent events that nobody in the history of the @entity15 has ever had to deal with , " @entity46 said			2
compared with the last millennium , the dryness will be unprecedented			0
adapting to it will be tough .			0

the current drought is bad , but it 's no megadrought
@entity1 : if greenhouse gas emissions do n't *drastically* drop , the nation 's @entity2 faces droughts that could last decades
