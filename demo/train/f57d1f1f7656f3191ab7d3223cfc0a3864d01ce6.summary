-- for goodness ' sake , it 's just like the @entity5 commercials			2
you know the ones , where they joke that " and " is better than " or , " whether it 's sweet and sour chicken or a bed and breakfast inn			2
same thing with working mothers			2
i am not a worker or a mother			2
i am both : a worker and a mother			2
this consistent , aggressive infighting about leaning in vs. leaning out -- reignited by the @entity21 story this week , " @entity22 , but @entity23 " -- is just more fodder for woman - on - woman mudslinging			1
and it does n't help anyone , least of all our kids , who are as a result groomed to think you ca n't be all you want to be			1
social media and listservs of professional women have been back and forth commenting on this seemingly neverending fight , fueled in part by media coverage and by the persistent attacks and retreats of women sniping at other women -- on both sides			1
it is belittling to assert that women can handle only one role at a time			1
and that one role is better than the other			1
no one is insisting a father has to choose between his work and his children in order to be a good dad			2
so why can a woman perform just one role at a time ? this latest @entity21 feature misses a key possibility : that it is entirely possible to be an ambitious good mother			1
the births of my three sons ( now 24 , 22 and 19 ) did not hormonally erase my desire to accomplish as much as possible professionally			2
the work that i love -- teaching journalism at @entity66 , writing books and articles , giving keynotes and leading professional workshops -- has not hindered my ability to attend every parent - teacher conference or scream their names from the stands for the past 20 years			0
but from this latest piece of work , you can gather it is not possible as a working parent to walk and chew gum at the same time			1
i recoil at the way working parents are characterized in this passage : " i never miss a baseball game , " said ms. @entity86 , uttering a statement that is a fantasy for millions of working mothers ( and fathers ) nationwide			0
( this attendance record is even more impressive when you realize that her children play in upward of six a week			0
) yes , @entity86 , you did your fair share			0
but i want to point out to the writer that like so many women , i went to way more than six games , matches , tournaments or conferences a week for three sons who played baseball , basketball , soccer and football before each finally settled into wrestling			1
there were weeks with nine to 15 games and practices for three boys			0
on the extremely rare occasion i missed ? it was because one son was in a game or match at the same time as another			1
there were plenty of saturdays where i drove from one gym to another across the suburbs of @entity122 , logging more than 100 miles			0
and on monday , i went to work			0
a whole lot of us do			0
according to a recent study from @entity127 , 40 % of all households with children younger than 18 include women who are either the sole or primary breadwinners			1
most of us -- 63 % -- are single mothers			0
what working women and stay - at - home mothers do not do is stop thinking of this as black / white either / or territory			1
millions of us waste time believing the grass is greener on the other side			1
even fashion designer @entity141 , 39 , feels that she may be missing out , and she comes home to @entity143			0
she told @entity144 this week , " it 's a huge juggling act , when you are a working mother and looking after your family			0
millions and millions of women around the world are doing this every day , but it 's not easy and yes , you feel guilty every time you walk out of the door to go to work			1
" as a single parent who is sole support and has been for many years , i have needed to work as hard as i possibly can , saying yes to every invitation to consult , speak , write or work in order to pay the mortgage , food , tuition , room and board and all else for three sons			0
i decided that it would be optimal to do work i love because there is no choice to opt out			0
for me , it works			0
i am not superwoman , and i am not hissing at the neighbors who stay home with their children as i pull out of the garage at 7 a.m. i am not perfect ; i do not do everything perfectly			0
i just really enjoy my life as a mother who is professionally ambitious , too			0
and i do not believe my children have suffered because of it			0
@entity181 , who recently completed the upcoming book " @entity183 : the @entity187 of @entity188 , " says her research shows that women do not want an either / or life			1
" i 've talked to scores of women who are trying to balance career and family			2
these women want fulfilling careers , and they are willing to do the hard work			2
but they are not willing to sacrifice their families , nor should they have to , " @entity181 said			0
but the issue is not entirely decided by mothers but by their employers			0
in her @entity21 story , @entity200 writes in defense of the story 's main character 's decision to scale back at work : " ms. @entity86 wants a rewarding career , but more than that she wants a flexible one			1
that ranking of priorities is not necessarily the one underlying best - selling books like @entity213 's ' @entity212 , ' which advises women to seek out leadership positions , throw themselves at their careers , find a partner who helps with child care and supports their ambition , and negotiate for raises and promotions			1
" @entity181 , a public relations executive , founder of the blog hello , ladies and mother of two , disagrees			0
" framing the issue as leaning in vs. leaning out is n't accurate , " she said			2
" for a variety of reasons , from overt and subtle gender discrimination at work , inflexible workplace policies , lack of support at home , outdated school schedules that do n't mesh with corporate hours , women are rejecting the corner office and businesses should take heed			1
" as women , we do not hesitate to claim that we can be wives , mothers , sisters , daughters and friends at the same time			1
why can we not be successful in our professions and parents at the same time without someone insisting it ca n't be done ? why ca n't we be good mothers and good employees ? i say it is about " and , " not " or			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			1

@entity256 writes that women sniping about whether to " @entity212 " does n't help
a recent @entity21 story *encourages* more infighting among women , she says
@entity269 : " it is belittling to assert that women can only handle one role at a time "
