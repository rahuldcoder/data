@entity0 -- the @entity5 is ramping up its @entity7 operations in anticipation of greater demand from inside and outside the country , but lack of access is proving problematic , the @entity4 group 's executive director told reporters tuesday			1
" most of my time has been spent with donors as well as the representatives from the neighboring countries regarding our operation in @entity7 , " @entity14 said at the @entity15 , which coincides with the meeting of world leaders here at the @entity18 the program , which provides services to 3 million @entity7 inside the country and 1.2 million outside , is making plans to boost those numbers next month to 4 million inside the country and 1.5 million to 1.7 million outside , she said			1
the program has 80 international staffers and 300 national staffers supporting the region			1
though some of them are working from @entity38 , @entity39 , others are spread across all 14 governorates of @entity7 , she said			1
but the group has had access " issues of access " to some areas " for some time , " she said			2
@entity14 did not say whether those issues were caused by the government or rebel forces			1
" what i 've said is that bullets do n't tell you what side they come from , " she said			0
" there 's enough complicity to go around we need all parties to provide us with access			2
" @entity5 is not involved in politics , she said			0
" we deal with the consequences of failed politics			0
" because of their apolitical stance , @entity5 representatives are able to talk to all sides in the civil war , " and that 's what we do , " she said			0
but the outlook is grim if access is not gained soon			2
@entity14 predicted that images of children suffering from severe malnutrition will emerge from the country this winter for a third year in a row			1
" those pictures will get worse and we , as the international community , should not wait until we have famine - like conditions before we bring attention to the fact that we do n't have access to too many of these areas			1
" she credited aggressive planning with helping authorities avert a famine last year in @entity84			1
the challenges can go beyond meeting nutritional needs , she said , citing one @entity7 man 's anger over the bread offered to him in a refugee camp in @entity39 where she was visiting recently			1
" he said , ' this is not @entity7 bread ; it is @entity39 bread , and they have their own recipe for bread , ' " she recalled			1
the program worked with @entity39 bakers to rejigger the recipe			0
" when we have the opportunity and the ability to meet not only nutritional needs but cultural needs , we try to comply , " she said , adding that that was not always possible			0
last year , @entity5 fed nearly 99 million people in 88 countries , she said			0
it is 100 % voluntarily funded , and each year it must raise the funds it expects to use by asking for them			0
last year 's total was just over $ 4 billion			0
but its resources are finite			0
some 10 million people in @entity121 are " food insecure , " meaning they live in hunger or in fear of starvation , she said			0
and @entity126 has reduced the size of its school feeding program , despite ongoing need , " because we 're underresourced , " @entity14 said			1
over the long term , more challenges await			0
she said @entity5 is working with the @entity4 @entity133 to prepare for the effects of climate change by getting more drought - tolerant seeds to farmers			2
