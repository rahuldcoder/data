-- the 20th @entity3 nominations were announced wednesday morning , and as one of the leading awards show salvos in what is expected to be a competitive season , what did n't get nominated was as notable as what did			2
so was anybody from " @entity12			0
" " @entity16 " missed out on a best ensemble nomination , and " @entity14 of @entity15 " came up completely empty			0
a number of films did get good news			0
@entity20 2014 " @entity29 " was nominated for four awards -- best ensemble , best male actor ( @entity28 ) , best supporting male actor ( @entity25 ) and best supporting female actor ( @entity23 )			1
though " 12 years " has narrowly missed topping year - end best - of lists so far -- and has even been left out entirely on some -- it 's been considered an @entity32 shoo - in since its release in october , and the @entity34 do nothing to stall its momentum			1
on the other hand , " august : @entity43 , " the sprawling comedy - drama based on the @entity40 play , has been generally ignored on critics ' best - of lists			1
( " good but not great " is the consensus so far			0
) but it also did well at the @entity34 nominations , earning three nods , for ensemble , lead female actor @entity49 and supporting female actor @entity50			1
" @entity55 " also did well , earning nominations for ensemble , lead actor @entity53 and supporting actor @entity54			1
" @entity62 " and " @entity63 " complete the list of nominees for best ensemble , the @entity60 ' closest equivalent to best picture			1
" @entity62 " also earned nods for stars @entity66 ( best actor ) and @entity68 ( female supporting actor )			1
@entity70 added to " @entity72 's " haul with a female supporting actor nomination			2
and " @entity16 , " though snubbed in the ensemble category , picked up nominations for star @entity75 and a surprise nod for supporting actor @entity77			1
" @entity16 " is the film debut for @entity77 , a @entity80 immigrant who plays a ship hijacker			0
but there are a number of @entity32 favorites that could n't get into the ring			2
" her , " the @entity86 work about a man who develops a relationship with a computer operating system , was completely shut out			0
so was " @entity14 of @entity15 , " the new @entity93 film , despite excellent early buzz			0
keep up to date on who has won what with our @entity3 tracker @entity10 , whose one - man show in " @entity99 " has made him a favorite for best actor , was left off @entity34 's list			1
so were @entity103 ( from the @entity104 ' latest , " @entity12 , " which came up completely empty ) , @entity106 ( " @entity107 " ) and " @entity63 's " @entity108 and @entity109			0
the most unlikely nominees were focused in the supporting actor category			2
besides @entity77 , @entity112 picked up a nomination for @entity115 's mostly overlooked " @entity114 , " and the late @entity116 was honored for his work in the comedy " @entity119			0
" though the actors ' wing represents the biggest bloc of @entity32 voters , the @entity60 are n't always a great bellwether of best picture success at the @entity32			1
though " @entity127 , " last year 's best picture , also won the @entity60 ' ensemble honor , the 18th annual @entity34 went with " @entity130 " over " @entity131 " and the 16th annual awards tapped " @entity133 " over " the @entity134			2
" the picks for actor and actress , on the other hand , are much closer to the academy 's selections			0
last year 's @entity141 went to @entity142 and @entity143 ; the year before honored @entity147 ( though @entity144 lost the @entity32 to @entity49 ) ; and 2010 @entity34 went to @entity145 and @entity146			1
does it mean anything ? thursday may muddy the waters further , when the @entity151 announces the @entity153 nominations			0
@entity154 and @entity155 will air the 20th @entity3 on january 18 .			0

@entity60 nominations leave out @entity10 for best actor
" @entity29 " earns four nods ; " august : @entity43 " gets three
actors are large bloc of @entity32 voters so @entity141 are examined for @entity32 forecasts
