@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 @entity4 winner @entity3 believes his country 's current crop of stars are capable of earning a record - extending sixth title in @entity1			1
the former striker , now 46 , was a member of 1994 team that triumphed in the @entity12 along with the likes of @entity14 and captain @entity15 , who is now @entity16 's national coach			1
he scored three goals in that tournament , and made the headlines after celebrating his effort in the quarterfinal against the @entity22 by racing to the touchline and rocking his arms back and forth in honor of the recent birth of his third child			0
that year @entity16 became the first country to win the @entity4 four times , having last triumphed in 1970			1
they managed it under the guidance of coach @entity34 , who is now in charge of 2010 hosts @entity1			1
@entity16 won a dour final on penalties against @entity39 after the match ended 0 - 0 following extra-time , and @entity15 has been criticized for instigating a similar tactical approach as he left out talented but faded stars such as @entity44 and @entity45 from his 23 - man @entity4 squad			1
but @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity48 that @entity15 deserves to be given time to impress , having opened the event with a hard - fought 2 - 1 win over @entity52 ahead of sunday 's second @entity54 clash with the @entity55 at @entity0 's @entity56			1
" i think that this squad is a very strong one			0
there already world champions in it : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , and others that already won the cup , " he said			2
@entity15 is working with a group of winners : they came top of their qualifying group , they won the @entity75 here in @entity1 [ in 2009 ] and they won @entity77			1
how it is possible to say something against this kind of squad ? " @entity3 agreed that there were similarities between @entity15 's team and that of 1994			1
" it 's a hard - working team			2
it will be very hard to score against @entity16 , " he said			0
" i think they have the best defense in the world , starting with our goalkeeper -- that makes them similar to the champions in ' 94			0
" when we won in ' 94 , we were already together for 40 days			0
and that helped a lot			0
so we need to be patient , and let @entity15 do his job			0
players like @entity65 and @entity99 can make the difference			0
" @entity101 too , even if he 's not in peak condition , and @entity65 as well			2
but a player like @entity65 , if he feels good , oh my @entity104 ... " @entity65 has struggled to find form after an injury - hit first season with @entity107 in @entity108 , having left @entity110 club @entity109 where he had been hailed as the best player in the world			2
forward @entity99 has regained the form that prompted @entity114 club @entity113 to break the @entity116 transfer record in 2008 , but only after returning home on loan to @entity119 .			0

former @entity4 winner @entity3 believes @entity16 can claim sixth title in @entity1
@entity3 played with current coach @entity15 in 1994 triumph in the @entity12
the 46 - year - old says @entity15 's squad have enough experience to do well in 2010
he believes *playmaker* @entity65 will be a key figure if he can regain his best form
