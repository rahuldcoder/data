-- when fans approach @entity3 for photographs , they do n't want the typical arm - around - the - shoulder celeb shot			1
rather , they want the former world heavyweight champion to pose as if he 's going to chomp their ear off			1
and he 's ok with that			0
the former world heavyweight champion sat down with @entity12 for a candid talk about his battles in an out of the ring with drugs and alcohol , and finally being at peace with his own life			1
@entity3 has been the fiercest fighter of his generation , done jail time , and even starred in a one - man show on @entity24			1
" it 's a big joke now , " @entity3 told @entity12 of the infamous 1997 boxing match in which he bit off a portion of @entity28 's ear			1
the incident disqualified him from the match and racked up fines and a host of legal woes for @entity3 , whose bad - boy reputation had gone off the rails many a time			1
both men starred in a recent @entity39 commercial in which @entity3 " returned " the ear , but he told @entity12 that he is sincerely sorry			1
@entity12 asked @entity3 about the turning point in his career that was his cameo in the 2009 smash comedy film " @entity44			1
" " for a lot of people ' the @entity46 ' movie was a real turning point , " said @entity12			2
" it was a very endearing performance			0
" like his " @entity46 " alter - ego , @entity3 actually has had " a few tigers " as pets			1
" you ca n't just throw them in the backseat like a dog , and have his head go out the window and go for a drive , right ? " inquired @entity12			2
" you could , " said @entity3 , however " they do n't like the wind ... hitting them in the face			2
" " so , you can go for a drive with your pet tiger , " asked @entity12 , " just do n't open the window ? " " well ... just crack it a little bit , " @entity3 laughed			1
" @entity72 , they pass gas			0
" in @entity3 's earlier days , at the height of his boxing career in the late 1980s - early 1990s , he was knocking out his opponents at just 30 and 40 seconds into the game			1
following what he described as a rough upbringing in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity3 told @entity12 he had been arrested more than 40 times by the time he was 12			1
but by 20 years of age , @entity3 had become @entity84			2
" once you get there , " asked @entity12 , " how difficult is it to deal with it ? " " it gives you a false sense of security , " @entity3 told the @entity0 host			1
" it makes you somewhat believe that you ca n't even die			0
and it turns you into a coward			0
this is what i know			0
people are n't born humble			0
human beings have to be humbled in order to really appreciate the value of life			0
" along with the fame and notoriety came great fortune			0
but the money came and went fast			0
" i could n't fathom the zeros , " @entity3 confessed			2
" just a lot of zeros ... that money put a lot of demons in me			0
i 'm not one of those guys that should have too much goodies and stuff			0
" chalking his monetary downfall to poor spending habits and managers who were n't looking out for his best interests , among other things , has inspired @entity3 , now 47 , to help young boxers avoid some of the pitfalls he fell prey to in his 20s in a new career turn as a boxing promoter			1
" how are you doing it differently than the guys who promoted you ? " asked @entity12			2
" i 'll make sure my guys get their money at the end of the day , " said @entity3 , " and they wo n't have to worry about that			2
they have to be responsible , like i was n't			0
i was n't a responsible fighter .			0
