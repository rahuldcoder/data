@entity0 -- former president @entity7 's " infitah " or open door policy was a megaproject touted as a fix - all to @entity5 's ailing economy			1
the idea seemed logical on paper -- attracting foreign investment as a means of reaching economic prosperity			0
in reality , however , the open door policy widened social disparities , yielding a boom in construction , hotel , and tourism industries and concentrating wealth in the hands of a few			0
by 1977 -- nearly three years after the project had been in effect -- nine out of 10 @entity5 were living in poverty and half of the country 's men did n't have regular jobs			2
@entity7 's decision to address the situation with a @entity33 loan was conditional upon cutting subsidies for basic foodstuffs			0
the result were the infamous " bread riots " of 1977			0
nearly 40 years later , a new $ 8.4 billion dollar @entity39 expansion project stands poised to -- as a @entity33 official put it -- " change the economic landscape of @entity5 " by engaging private business and creating at least one million new jobs			2
the project will likely create wealth -- but will it be shared by all ? @entity5 's recent history with such projects raises doubts			2
former president @entity51 embarked upon several neoliberal projects which were also billed as economic fix - alls that ultimately only benefited a select few			1
@entity0 2050 in the late 2000s and @entity55 in the late 1990s were two massive urban planning projects costing into the billions which did little to address @entity5 's social disparities and eventually failed			1
both of these projects hinged upon displacing something around 20 % of the @entity5 population -- many of whom were living in informal urban areas in the @entity66 -- to satellite towns in the desert			2
@entity69 relied on private sector investments while @entity0 sought to replace @entity66 valley residents with five star hotels , business parks , wide boulevards , and compounds			0
before these two projects was the smaller - scaled @entity77 , a private residence complex 17 km west of @entity0 designed for the upper classes seeking an escape from the din of the city			0
in his piece , @entity77 : the neoliberalism of your desires , @entity85 uses the example of the project to show the lopsided economic benefits of @entity51 's projects			1
@entity85 describes @entity77 as a complex featuring " luxury fiber - optic - wired villas , shopping malls , theme parks , golf courses , and polo grounds " staffed by employees who did n't earn enough in a month to attend its amusement park			0
@entity85 also points to nationwide social disparities yielded by @entity51 's neoliberal project focus , explaining that from 1990 to 1995 , public industrial sector wages dropped eight percent , and that by 1999 soup kitchens had reappeared and school teachers were making less than $ 2 a day			1
today @entity5 continues to suffer from a wide range of economic and social issues			1
many of them , like unemployment , and problems with sewage and running water , are more or less as they were when @entity7 came to office in 1970			0
others , such as public education , insufficient electricity , cases of @entity118 and poor hospital care have only worsened			0
recently , president @entity120 stated that the world 's poorest education system needed 30,000 new " quality teachers " -- but added that it was n't possible now as it would cost le 18 billion ( $ 2.5 billion )			0
but could n't the government tone down its megaprojects and allocate some of its funds to social programs like this one ? a smaller expansion of the @entity39 and following up on @entity131 's " expensive " suggestions to reform the education system would reduce illiteracy rates and improve performance in the labor market while also having a positive effect on the general health of the population			1
it would also strengthen the social contract by showing that the government is taking action that will directly affect the livelihood of more than just a few			2
if @entity5 's current economic situation was n't an aberration -- if this was the first time the government was faced with laundry list of economic problems -- then the focus on a project like the @entity147 expansion would be understandable			1
however , as the lights in @entity5 continue to flicker , it seems like the country needs something more than another fix - all megaproject to heal its same economic ails .			1

@entity5 continues to suffer from a wide range of economic and social issues , writes @entity163
former president @entity51 's fix - all neoliberal projects benefit a few , he says
he asks : could n't the government allocate funding to social programs ?
@entity163 : it would show that the government is directly affecting the livelihood of more than a few
