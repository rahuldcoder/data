@entity5 profile the @entity38 's projections raised two key questions rooted in @entity0 's complicated political past : has the @entity80 , a political party that critics accuse of being authoritarian and corrupt , changed its approach ? and will supporters of @entity12 protest election results as they have in the past ? @entity68 - @entity0 relationship @entity5 said sunday night that he was looking forward , not back			1
