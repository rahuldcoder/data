-- if you access @entity3 via the web browser on a " feature phone " -- a simpler , less powerful cousin to the smartphone -- your experience might improve significantly over the next few weeks			1
on friday , @entity3 announced an upgrade to its " lean " mobile site m.facebook.com			1
this upgrade integrates the full range of features found in @entity3 's mobile site for smartphones and other phones with touchscreen browsers : @entity16			1
this update is being rolled out gradually to @entity3 users			2
@entity3 product designer @entity19 explained : " with the new m.facebook.com , users with high - end touch devices will see a rich touch - friendly interface ; for users with feature phones , the site will look and work great			1
... there will no longer be a difference between m.facebook.com and @entity30 , we 'll automatically serve you the best version of the site for your device			0
" here 's why this is a smart move -- one that i wish more online sites and services would emulate			0
too often , as popular sites and services upgrade their mobile offerings , they cater primarily to smartphone users -- which means they end up leaving the vast majority of mobile users further behind			2
according to new numbers from @entity53 , currently only 29 % of handsets in use in the @entity51 are smartphones			0
a brief definition : while the lines between the two types of devices are becoming blurred , smartphones are defined as having operating systems capable of running " native " apps with a wide range of sophisticated functions , and fully featured web browsers ( usually based on the @entity65 browser )			2
feature phones tend to be cheaper , simpler , and more limited			0
often feature phones lack touchscreens , and they usually run simple apps based on @entity70			0
while smartphones are getting more popular , and many feature phones are getting smarter -- well , at least getting better web browsers -- most mobile users are n't yet willing to handle the costs and complexity associated with smartphones			1
consequently , feature phones will likely continue to be a huge part of the mobile market for at least a few more years			2
@entity81 reports that @entity3 currently has about 600 million users worldwide , and about 250 million of them already access @entity3 from their cell phones			1
with an enhanced experience for simpler cell phones , i 'd expect that @entity3 might quickly grow its mobile user base -- and probably also pick up a lot of new website users			1
that 's the point : @entity3 's business model hinges on getting as many people as possible engaged as much as possible			0
this means finding a way to efficiently serve the mobile devices they 're using today -- not just targeting the mobile devices they might be using a few years from now			0
the move to upgrade and unify @entity3 's mobile web experience also will streamline web development for @entity3			1
as if it is n't complicated enough to maintain native apps for each major smartphone operating system ( @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , etc. ) , maintaining multiple mobile website versions consumes considerable time and resources			0
" every time we launched a new feature , we had to build it multiple times across different code bases , " wrote @entity19			0
" once for @entity3 , then again for @entity114 , @entity16 , and in native applications as well			1
honestly , we were n't very good at doing this , so certain features were missing on different devices			0
" coupled with @entity3 's recent acquisition of @entity120 -- a popular platform for @entity70 - based apps that runs on most feature phones -- this consolidation of the company 's mobile web efforts indicates an unusually inclusive mobile strategy			1
@entity3 is clearly taking a hard look at the mobile market that actually exists , rather than the one that most developers and wireless carriers seem to believe , or wish , exists			2
if @entity3 can move fast to serve feature phone users well , while other social media services -- except @entity137 , of course -- tend to treat feature phones as an afterthought , it 's more likely to maintain loyal users for the long term			2
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity145 .			0
