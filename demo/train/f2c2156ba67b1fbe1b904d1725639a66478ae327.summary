-- literary circles were abuzz after three previously unpublished short stories by @entity4 author @entity3 showed up on the @entity5 this week			1
the reported works by the reclusive writer of " @entity8 " appeared numerous places online , including upload sites @entity10 and @entity12			2
they were previously only available for academic study			0
the 41 - page album is simply called " @entity16			0
" it contains these offerings : " @entity19 , " " birthday boy " and " @entity21			0
" so , could this be legit ? @entity23 book critic @entity22 says yes			0
" i 've never read " @entity19 " : it 's part of a collection of @entity3 material at the @entity29 and available only to scholars who are supervised as they read , " he said in the online edition of the paper			1
" i have read the other two stories , however , at the @entity33 ' @entity32 , and the versions of them in ' @entity16 ' are the real deal			1
" another affirmation comes from @entity3 scholar @entity38 , author of " @entity3 : a life , " who talked with @entity41			2
" while i do quibble with the ethics ( or lack of ethics ) in posting the @entity3 stories , they look to be true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies , " @entity38 told @entity41 in an e-mail			1
@entity51 had its own theories on how the stories could have made it to the public			2
" the story is probably an unauthorized version transcribed longhand in our reading room , " said @entity56 , a @entity51 spokesman			2
" it 's also possible that it came from photocopies of the typescript probably made before the mid- 1980s when we decided that we would no longer allow photo - duplication for any work by @entity3			0
" but several reports point to a september auction on @entity71 of " @entity73 @entity3 ( catcher in the rye ) @entity72 " which went for about $ 110 , as the source of the online material			1
the pages were scanned and uploaded , the reports suggest			0
a photo included with the listing says it was first printed in @entity81 in 1999 and identifies it as copy number six out of 25 numbered copies			0
ironically , the page also says : " the three stories in this book remain unpublished and locked by @entity3 for publishing			1
" @entity3 was known to fiercely guard his writings and only allowed a relatively small number to be published before his death in 2010 at age 91			1
rare book sells for $ 14.2 million			0
