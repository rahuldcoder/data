@entity0 -- former @entity3 spy @entity2 , who headed @entity5 operations in the @entity6 in the 1970s and later left @entity7 to live in @entity6 , told @entity1 tuesday he is " amazed " that @entity8 is engaging so heavily in espionage against @entity0			1
reacting to the recent arrests of 11 alleged @entity7 spies , @entity2 said that getting the type of information the @entity12 says the operatives collected " does not require such a massive assault " against the @entity6			1
" i am amazed , " he said			0
" it reminds me of the worst years of the @entity18			0
" @entity2 also said he was " amused " by reports of the arrests			2
" it is a sign of the decadence of the @entity7 intelligence services , " he said			2
" why do they need to use so many people to get information that is openly available ? " @entity27 : the spies next door ? the @entity30 announced monday that 10 people had been arrested in the @entity6 on charges of being @entity7 spies on long - term missions in the @entity6 @entity36 spokesman called the suspects " trained @entity7 intelligence operatives			2
" an 11th suspect was arrested tuesday in @entity40 , @entity40 police told @entity1			0
the government 's complaints against the alleged operatives say their mission was " to become sufficiently americanized such that they can gather information about the @entity6 for @entity7 , and can successfully recruit sources who are in , or able to infiltrate , @entity6 policy - making circles			1
" @entity2 said that has been a mission for @entity3 and @entity7 operatives for decades : to look for potential spies in the @entity6 with the ultimate purpose of placing them in key government agencies like the @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity58			1

the former @entity3 spy told @entity1 he did not believe that @entity7 president @entity68 knew of the pending arrests during his visit to the @entity58 last thursday , but his impression was that president @entity72 did know and it was reflected in a " rather strained " visit with @entity68			0

" @entity2 said former @entity7 president and now prime minister @entity89 -- himself a former @entity5 agent -- has restored the role of the intelligence agency , now called the @entity93 , and its arm that deals with foreign intelligence , the @entity96			2
