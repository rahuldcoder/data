-- as the number of children with autism has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades , experts have learned that the earlier a child gets diagnosed , the earlier specialized therapy can be initiated , which can significantly improve outcomes			1
now researchers have been able to show that a particular type of behavioral therapy called the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) not only improves autism symptoms , but actually normalizes brain activity and improves social behavior			1
autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts to become very apparent around age 3			2
the main signs and symptoms of autism involve communication , social interactions and repetitive behaviors			0
according to the latest statistics from the @entity26 @entity27 , one in 88 children currently is diagnosed with autism , including one in 54 boys			1
" early intervention alters the trajectory of the brain and social development in children with autism , " says @entity29 , the lead study author who developed the @entity12 therapy along with study co-author @entity31			1
@entity36 was a researcher at the @entity37 when she helped devise @entity12 ; she 's now the chief science officer for the advocacy and research group @entity38 and a professor at the @entity41			1
@entity42 is a professor and researcher at the @entity44			0
@entity12 therapy uses teaching methods from @entity47 , or applied behavioral analysis , the traditional one - on - one interaction between a child and the therapist			1
but rather than sitting at a desk next to the child -- where a teacher or therapist breaks down complex tasks into small components and gives tangible reinforcements -- children receiving @entity12 are sitting on the floor , playing with their therapist or parents			1
it can be done just about anywhere , and @entity36 says the play - based method of engaging a child helps him or her develop a social relationship			0
autism event pegged to @entity69 draws story of perseverance the study began with 48 children in @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity76 , who were between who were between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 years old			1
half of the children received a total of 20 hours of @entity12 therapy over five days a week			1
but since parents can be taught the methods in just a few hours , they could engage their children using the @entity12 method as well			1
the other half of the toddlers received community - based interventions , which included in some individual therapist sessions and some day care - based sessions			0
the number of hours spent with therapists was the same in both groups			0
three years ago , @entity42 and @entity36 published their first findings from this study and found that children receiving @entity12 therapy increased their iq and language skills three times more than children in the community - intervention group			1
that in itself was " very significant , " says dr. @entity106 , director of the @entity107 , because it proved that early detection and intervention leads to improved outcomes			0
in their latest study , published friday in the @entity112 , @entity42 and @entity36 show what parts of a child 's brain are active after two years of therapy , compared to typically developing children , using an @entity120 ( electroencephalogram )			1
in an @entity120 , electrical activity in different parts of the brain is measured using electrodes that attached to the child 's head			2
" if the child wiggles too much , the data is not interpretable , " says @entity36			0
in the end , researchers could only get 60 % of the children to sit still enough to get usable @entity120 results , she says , but that was true in both the group of children with autism and those without			2
fifteen children in the @entity142 group , 14 in the community intervention group and 17 typically developing children underwent eegs while looking at pictures of faces ( social stimuli ) vs. pictures of toys ( nonsocial stimuli )			0
technicians measuring the brain activity had no idea which children had autism and which did not			1
" children who received @entity12 now showed a normal ( brain ) response , identical to typical 4 - year - olds , " @entity36 tells @entity0			1
that was n't the case with most children who did n't have @entity12 therapy			1
with autism , no longer invisible babies are naturally drawn to people and faces , and their brains show greater responses when they look at a face , compared to an object or a toy , @entity36 says			0
but in young and even older children with autism , the opposite happens			2
the part of the brain that should be responding to a face or social activity does n't light up , but the part of the brain that responds to objects is more active			2
@entity106 says this study shows that the @entity12 form of therapy " not only changes behavior , it changes the brain			1
" the exact cause , or more precisely causes , of autism are unknown and there is no cure			0
parents and pediatricians are urged to look for early signs of autism including : little or no eye contact , lack of or delay of spoken language , repetitive use of language and behaviors and persistent fixation on parts of objects			0
since 2007 , the @entity204 recommends that pediatricians screen 18 - and 24 - month - old toddlers for signs of autism			0
when something is wrong in the brain -- not just in autism , but also in diseases like @entity211 's and @entity212 's -- what 's causing the disease is occurring much earlier than when symptoms appear , @entity106 explains			2
based on the new findings , perhaps using @entity217 to measure this type of brain activity could be a biomarker for autism , he says			1
a biomarker is a distinct characteristic that indicates a particular condition			0
measuring a baby 's brain activity as early as 3 and 6 months could identify changes in the brain before changes in behavior are noticed , he says , and therapy could begin even earlier			1
the @entity12 model could be applied as early as 12 months , say @entity36 and @entity42			2
more research will probably have to be done to confirm the biomarker			0
so until there is a definitive test for diagnosing autism , @entity36 says this it 's even more important that pediatricians screen children for autism as early as possible			2
" the average age of diagnosis is still 4 and 5 and even older in minority groups , " she says			0
" we really need to close the gap			0
" @entity38 has many tools on its website to help parents see what a child with autism looks like compared to a typically developing child			0
there are also many tool kits to help families of children with autism			2
why autistic kids make easy targets for school bullies			0

a type of behavioral therapy can actually normalize brain activity in kids with autism
the @entity12 is a type of play therapy
measuring brain activity could be a biomarker for autism , experts say
about 1 in 88 children are diagnosed with autism , according to the @entity27
