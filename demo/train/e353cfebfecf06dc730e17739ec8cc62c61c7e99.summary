if an airline loses or delays your bag , can you trust it to let you know how much money you 're entitled to ? one passenger says do n't count on it			1
she 's suing @entity8 for breach of contract , alleging that the carrier leaves fliers in the dark about the compensation they 're entitled to when their bags vanish			2
the @entity17 @entity16 requires airlines to pay up to $ 3,300 per passenger if bags are " lost , damaged , delayed or pilfered " on a domestic flight			1
but lawyers for @entity23 say @entity8 " uniformly and systematically " ignores this rule and often tells passengers they are only entitled to $ 25 to $ 50 a day in expenses			1
@entity8 has not responded to a request for comment , but it 's not the first time the company has faced this complaint : last year , the @entity16 fined the airline $ 100,000 for failing to comply with the government rule			1
@entity23 , a @entity34 resident , says she flew on @entity8 from @entity35 to @entity36 in november of 2010			2

the bag turned up a couple of days later , her attorney @entity50 said			0
@entity16 spokesman @entity54 declined to comment on this specific case , but said in general , carriers are not supposed to limit compensation when passengers are forced to buy essentials after their bags are delayed			0

" travelers should not have to pay for toiletries or other necessities while they wait for baggage misplaced by airlines , " @entity60 said in a 2009 memo warning airlines not to improperly limit reimbursements			2
a few weeks after her flight , @entity23 made a claim with @entity8 for her expenses , which was " rejected and / or ignored , " her lawyers say			0
" what happened to ( @entity23 ) happens every day to @entity8 passengers whose bags are delayed , " the complaint alleges			1
" such tactics allow @entity8 to pocket millions and millions it would have had to pay out if it had abided by its contracts with passengers			2
" @entity23 is suing on behalf of herself and other @entity8 passengers who have found themselves in a similar situation			0
the class action is asking for a jury trial to award direct , compensatory and punitive damages .			0
