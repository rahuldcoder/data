-- reigning world and @entity3 champions @entity4 set up the purists ' dream @entity8 final against host nation @entity9 but only after squeaking past a stubborn @entity11 side on penalties			1
the heavyweight @entity3 nations produced an entertaining game which somehow ended goalless after extra time , as both sides ' endurance was tested to the limit in the heat of @entity21			0
in contrast to the finishing seen in open play , the strikes at goal in the penalty shootout were of the highest standard until defender @entity29 skied the 13th effort well wide of goal			0
that allowed @entity33 to coolly fire @entity4 into sunday 's final as 7 - 6 winners on penalties -- so maintaining their hopes of holding the world , @entity3 and @entity8 titles all at once			1
having won the @entity39 ( 2010 ) , the @entity40 ( on three occasions ) and the @entity42 ( 1992 ) , @entity44 's so - called @entity43 -- which pits the continental champions against both the @entity39 winners and hosts -- is the one trophy missing from @entity4 's illustrious cabinet			1
yet @entity51 's side were not at their best against familiar foes and could have suffered an unexpected reverse had @entity55 not wasted a host of early opportunities , with @entity58 hitting a post early in extra time			2
the absence of injured striker @entity61 was keenly felt as @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 all missed gilt - edged opportunities in the opening 45 minutes			2
" i think it was an excellent performance from both teams , who proved they are right at the top of the @entity3 game , " @entity4 coach @entity51 told @entity44 's official website			2
" @entity55 were better than us for the whole first period when they put us in uncomfortable situations several times			2
" we could n't control the game properly and we looked very open			0
but , bit by bit , we got a second wind , improved after the interval and ended up being the better side come extra time			0
" then fortune went our way in the shootout , which put us through to a great final			0
we 're enormously excited about taking on @entity9 in the @entity88			0
" " despite all the things they 've won - our players feel like kids ! they 're playing @entity9 at the @entity88 and that 's taken them back to boyhood days			1
" the host nation ensured they will be playing in the iconic @entity97 stadium , which is set to host the @entity99 final , when beating fellow @entity100 2 - 1 in a tight contest on wednesday			1
@entity55 will feel they deserved more from the game than the chance to win third place when facing the @entity106 in @entity107 on sunday , even if goalkeeper @entity108 did turn a @entity110 effort against the post in the dying moments			1
" the lads played a great match , from the first minute to the last , and we created plenty of situations that could have won us the game , but once it goes to penalties anything can happen , " said @entity118 , whose tactics successfully stifled the @entity120			0
" @entity4 are currently ahead of us because they 've been following the same ideology for years , whereas we 're still forging our own path			0
" this match has been a great test for us , no doubt about that , and we passed it despite the result			0
we were convinced about how we needed to play , in both technical and tactical terms , and we proved that we have the quality to battle it out with the best			0
" @entity118 can reflect on a far superior display to the two teams ' meeting in the @entity40 final in @entity136 one year ago , when @entity4 romped to a 4 - 0 victory as they lifted the continental title for the third time following previous triumphs in 1964 and 2008			1
when the sides had met in the group stages in @entity145 last year , the 1 - 1 draw was built upon @entity55 's decision to play a three - man defense -- and @entity118 's decision to revert to that system once again restricted @entity120 creativity for large parts of the game			1
@entity9 coach @entity153 will have followed the tactical ploy with interest as his side bid to win the @entity8 for the third time in a row following successes in 2005 and 2009			1
as has become a feature of the @entity8 , the build - up to the match witnessed clashes between police and anti-government protesters			2
@entity9 has been hit by wave of mass demonstrations as its citizens clamor for better public services in a land where $ 15 billion has been set aside to host the @entity8 and next year 's @entity39			1
over a million people took to the streets in the early days of the tournament but there were just an estimated 5,000 protesting in @entity21 on thursday , with police saying they arrested 72 people .			0

@entity4 beat @entity55 7 - 6 on penalties after *semifinal* ends goalless after 120 minutes
@entity39 winners will now meet hosts @entity9 in sunday 's @entity8 final
@entity55 have chance to seal third place against @entity100 on sunday
