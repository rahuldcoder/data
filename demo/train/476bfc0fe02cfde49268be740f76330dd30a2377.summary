-- if you were a @entity3 fan who attended the @entity6 @entity5 at @entity7 in 2005 , it could be argued you witnessed one of the strangest races in motorsport history			1
a field of 20 cars should have lined up for the grand prix , but on that sunday of june 19 just six were on the starting grid			2
it was the result of a bizarre sequence of events which left motorsport fans feeling so shortchanged it nearly drove @entity20 out of the @entity6 for good			1
so frustrated was the @entity7 crowd that fans hissed and hurled bottles when @entity26 's @entity25 led home the six drivers -- as the other 14 brooded in their garages			1
" it was sad not to have the gp that we wished to have , " @entity30 , who finished second behind his @entity25 teammate , told @entity0			1
" the weekend was long			0
it was sad because of something we were n't prepared for and something the fans did n't understand			0
" it was a horrible feeling not to see the cars racing , but unfortunately it was n't safe for everyone to race			1
" tire trouble the controversy unfolded after a punctured tire during practice caused @entity48 's @entity47 to crash at the circuit 's banked final turn -- the fastest part of the track			1
@entity47 used @entity54 rubber and , after further investigation into the tire failure , @entity54 advised the seven teams who used their tires -- @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity47 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 -- not to race			1
faced with a dilemma over whether to risk racing on unsafe tires , nine of the teams -- including @entity70 and @entity71 , who along with @entity25 ran on @entity74 tires -- agreed only to compete if a chicane was added to the final turn to lessen the tire load			1
but @entity25 and motorsport 's governing body , the @entity78 , vetoed the plan			1
from there , the gp descended into farce			0
as all 20 cars circled the @entity7 on the formation lap , it was still unclear whether the @entity54 teams intended to boycott the race			1
@entity65 driver @entity87 even argued on the team radio : " if it comes down to my choice , i want to race			2
" but at the end of the parade lap , the seven @entity54 teams peeled off into the pit lane -- leaving only @entity25 , @entity70 and @entity71 to contest the race			1
" without question it was the strangest race i commentated on in @entity20 , " remembered commentator @entity96 , who was calling the race for @entity98			0
" i can clearly recall my heart sinking when one car after another peeled into the pit lane			0
" the full extent of the problem became apparent when the camera showed just six cars on the grid -- and in their original positions , separated by huge gaps			0
" i have no idea how my fellow commentator @entity113 and i got through the next hour and a half			0
i was praying the producer in @entity116 would switch to the @entity118 golf but she did n't ! " bitter taste for the six racers on track , the events of that day were no less bizarre as they raced strung out on the asphalt			1
@entity30 was involved in the race 's only incident of note , when @entity26 squeezed the @entity128 's car onto the grass as he emerged from the pit lane to retake the lead			0
" sometimes you do race alone so the @entity6 gp was n't strange for that , " said @entity30 with the pragmatism of a racer who has taken part in more grands prix than any other driver in @entity20 history			1
" but it was bad because mentally you knew that there was only six cars out on the track			1
for me , i still had to fight for it but it was a horrible feeling			0
" a weekend of petty squabbling and farcical racing undoubtedly left @entity6 fans with a bitter taste in their mouths			1
" the fans were incensed -- and rightly so , " said @entity96			0
" while the mood in the paddock was a mix of bewilderment , silent anger and resignation			0
" many felt then @entity78 president @entity161 had not done enough to find a compromise which would have allowed all 20 cars to race			1
@entity54 also faced criticism for failing to bring suitable tires to the race and the @entity168 company later agreed to refund disgruntled fans			1
" i thought that would be the end of the @entity6 gp , " @entity96 recalled			1
" but reparation by @entity54 and the passage of time brought a surprisingly large crowd back in 2006			1
" @entity62 fans in the @entity6 may be a small percentage of that huge sporting audience but they are very loyal and knowledgeable			2
" racing history over the last few years , the outrage at the events of the 2005 @entity6 gp has mellowed into rose - tinted nostalgia			1
" i call it the train wreck theory , " said @entity20 presenter @entity183 , who has been the voice of the sport in the @entity6 for nearly 30 years			2
" as time goes by people get over the shock of not being provided the show they paid their ticket price for			0
the 2005 race was the kind of event where people want to say ' yes i saw that , i was there for that			2
' " people look back at it now as a phenomenal moment in racing history			2
" at the time , however , that was not the way @entity62 supremo @entity206 viewed the race			0
when the contract for the @entity6 gp expired at the end of 2007 , @entity206 chose not to renew his deal with @entity7 for the following season			2
both parties insisted money was n't the only factor			0
@entity62 wanted to expand its horizons and in 2008 , the @entity6 race was gone as @entity217 rejoined the wold championship calendar			1
free gifts for @entity30 , the events of 2005 echoed another bittersweet race at @entity7			2
three years earlier he had taken his only @entity6 gp victory by just 0.011 seconds -- the second closest finish in @entity20 history			1
but there had been no breathless surge to the checkered flag to snatch victory from defeat			0
@entity26 , who had been leading the race , tried to lead the two @entity231 across the line in a dead heat			0
but the plan backfired and @entity30 edged the narrowest of wins			0
@entity237 , @entity26 suggested he had conceded victory to the @entity128 as a gesture of thanks after he had overtaken @entity30 under team orders to win the @entity242			0
many felt the result in the @entity6 was manipulated and cheated fans who had turned out in high numbers , even though @entity26 had wrapped up the 2002 title two months earlier			2
" that is a story that we never talked about , " recalled @entity30			0
" i was pushing @entity26 hard up to the last straight and he backed off and it was almost instant that i backed off too -- no thanks , i do n't want any free gifts like that			0
" then he backed off even more and i had to think ' i 'll go for it ' but then he may have thought ' ok he does n't want it , i 'll go for it ' -- and i think that is why it went so close			0
" when you dislike something you must try to see something in a different way and try to enjoy it when you do well			0
i had to think ' a win is a win			0
' " after a three - year absence , the @entity6 gp is back at a new circuit build outside @entity268 after an on - off agreement was finally settled and race fees were paid to @entity206 's company			1
and @entity30 is looking forward to the november 18 race -- though this time as a spectator			1
the 40 - year - old will travel to @entity268 to watch his first grand prix since calling time on a 19 - year @entity62 career at the end of the 2011 season			2
" i 've always loved the @entity6 gp , " said the @entity128 , who raced in the @entity6 - based @entity280 for @entity281 this year after losing his place with the @entity62 team			2
" @entity284 , @entity285 , i used to watch those races when i was a kiddo and i fell in love with it			0
" i 'd always wanted to race in the @entity6 as an @entity20 driver and so the year that they said we 're going to go back to @entity7 in 1998 i thought this is great , i 'm going to race at the famous track			1
" when i got there i loved the layout it was fantastic , it was 100 % enjoyment			0
i loved the place , i really did			0
" @entity300 is going to be awesome			2
we feel that @entity62 's reputation is bad in the @entity6 because that 's what people say , it 's something we create , but i had the opposite feeling this year when i raced in @entity307			2
" @entity6 are big fans of motorsport and @entity6 deserves not just one race @entity62 race , but two -- and , you know , @entity7 could be a good one to go back to			1

the @entity6 @entity5 of 2005 was one of the bizarre races in @entity3 history
14 cars sat out the race , with only @entity25 , @entity70 and @entity71 taking to the track
teams racing on @entity54 *branded* tires *elected* to not take part in the race
@entity3 returns to the @entity6 in @entity268 , @entity300 on november 18
