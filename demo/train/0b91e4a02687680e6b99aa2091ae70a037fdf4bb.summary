-- did you know that there exists an all - natural remedy for memory loss ? weight gain ? macular degeneration ? prostate enlargement ? these products are so successful that clinical testing has already begun ! just listen to the following testimonial from an unidentified person ... as these ads blare at you from your favorite am radio station , perhaps you wonder : how can this be legal ? since the late 1960s , aspirin makers have been trying to win the right to tell the public that a daily low - dose tablet can help prevent heart disease			2
they have been told no , and no , and no again			2
federal regulators are so nervous about over-selling aspirin 's benefits that they have restricted statements about aspirin to the most bland and basic			2
yet while the statements about aspirin have to be cushioned in the vaguest generalities , snake oil flim - flam can be huckstered in the most truth - defying way , thanks to a 1994 law coaxed through @entity31 by the people who make these drugs			1
the law bears the long title of the @entity36			1
it was sponsored in @entity38 by rep. @entity39 , @entity40 , and in the @entity41 by @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 , @entity45			2
the @entity36 law draws a line between synthesized medicines like aspirin and remedies made from herbs , minerals , vitamins and amino acids			1
this latter group was recategorized as " dietary supplements " -- that is , as foods rather than drugs			1
" drugs " are subjected to exacting scientific trial to prove them both safe and also effective			1
sellers of dietary supplements are not required to prove that their remedies work			1
they are not even required to prove them safe -- as " foods " they are presumed safe unless shown otherwise			2
" drugs " must disclose any risk of side effect			1
( that 's why those erectile dysfunction ads terrify tv audiences with their references to four - hour erections			2
) dietary supplements bear no such burden -- which is why @entity77 can be sold as an anti-depressant , without any mention of the disturbing indications that the herb weakens the effectiveness of birth control pills			1
" drug " advertising must be pre-approved by the @entity85 , which minutely reviews the ads ' accuracy			2
dietary supplement advertising is regulated by the @entity89			2
so long as supplements avoid promises to cure a specific disease , their sellers can say pretty much whatever they want , provided only that they have some kind of supporting evidence on file			1
that evidence does not have to meet any kind of scientific test : pretty much any pattern of ink on paper will do the job			1
i can not say , " my rosemary - sage - thyme - and - oregano tablets cure @entity107			2
" but if i pay my cousin $ 100 to do a few experiments , i can claim , " my tablets boost the immune system -- and clinical trials are under way ! " ( there is an exception to the permissive rules about advertising natural products : wine			2
there is substantial evidence that a glass of red wine a day reduces the risk of heart attack			1
the laws of most states forbid any hint or suggestion that moderate alcohol use might confer health benefits			2
still , if you ask the scientists , wine has better grounds to call itself a health food than does , say , echinacea ! ) fifteen years after receiving the favor of @entity31 , dietary supplements have grown into a $ 24 billion a year industry			1
most of the products sold by the industry are merely useless			0
for those who eat a balanced diet , scientists have found no quantifiable benefit from taking multivitamins			0
on the other hand , multivitamins probably wo n't do any harm			0
it would be better to give the $ 10 you spend on a jar of pills to the @entity155 , but at least you are not poisoning yourself			0
the same could not be said , alas , for the unfortunate customers of a @entity158 herbal dispensary who bought a supplement that contained the herb @entity162			1
the a. fangi herb is rich in aristolochic acid , a carcinogen -- and users experienced an outbreak of urinary tract cancers			0
@entity169 has since been banned in the @entity170			0
it remains legal in the @entity172			0
as outrages go , @entity31 ' special favor to the herbal supplement industry might seem relatively small stuff : a splash in the torrent of the $ 2 trillion per year that @entity172 spend on health and wellness			1
and yet in the midst of a great national debate over health care , this small outrage has some serious implications			0
advocates for the herbal supplement industry justify their special sweet deal by championing the right of consumers to make their own " health choices			1
" individual choice certainly sounds like the @entity172 way			0
but the fact is that most of us are not well positioned to make intelligent health choices			0
if we try to play our own doctor , we are going to expose our health -- and our money -- to risk and exploitation			1
as individuals , we have trouble distinguishing between anecdotes : " my neighbor took zinc for her cold and she said it really helped , " and data : most colds last four days , so you could smoke yak - dung cigarettes on day three and feel better on day four			0
we are poor balancers of risk : look at the rising number of @entity172 who resist taking vaccines because of astronomically remote chances that something might go wrong			1
we are vulnerable to placebos : " hey -- i took the 30 - day free sample and i feel sure my vision did improve ! " we are swayed by prejudice and ideology : the film - maker @entity224 wrote in @entity225 in 1992 : " i 'm convinced @entity107 is a government - engineered disease			1
" the reason we should defer to experts is not that the experts know everything			0
of course they do n't			0
it 's just that they know more than non-experts do			0
it 's not that science has all the answers			0
it 's just that astrologers , shamans , and natural healers have none of them			0
@entity172 spend over 50 percent more per person on their health than anyone else on earth			0
for all that extra money , @entity172 see very little benefit			0
@entity172 rank 42nd on earth in life expectancy , 29th in infant mortality			0
improving and rationalizing this costly and dysfunctional system is a gigantic , maybe impossible , task			0
but one small reform could strike a meaningful blow for reason and cost - effectiveness : apply the rules governing the advertising of aspirin to the advertising of oregano tablets			0
repeal the @entity36 law and give the @entity85 full authority over every manufactured substance that purports to promote health or relieve illness			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			1

consumers get *constant* pitches for herbal supplements as remedies
@entity270 says a 1994 law exempted supplements from scientific review
he says people who try to be their own doctor take on *unnecessary* risk
@entity286 : government should regulate supplements as it does drugs
