-- @entity1 set up a @entity3 semifinal clash with world no. 1 @entity4 after battling past @entity7 11th seed @entity5 on wednesday			1
third seed @entity1 was taken to three sets by the 2007 @entity11 finalist , who had raced to a 4 - 0 lead in the first set when their quarterfinal match was halted by rain on tuesday			1
@entity5 duly closed out the opener , but @entity1 fought back to claim the match 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 after two and a half hours			1
she has now won 12 successive times in matches that have gone to three sets since her third - round defeat in @entity22 last year , and 24 out of 25 since the start of 2011			1
" i think the rain delay gave me some time to think about things , " the @entity25 champion said			2
" i came out so flat yesterday , and she was playing so well			0
i just played a bad four games , but i knew the match was n't over and had a chance to come back and turn things around			0
" @entity1 will be seeking revenge for her thrashing by @entity4 in the final of the opening grand slam of the season in @entity38 , but has lost four successive matches in straight sets to the @entity41 on hard courts			1
" tough challenge , " she admitted			0
" she beat me in @entity38 quite easily and i would love to get my revenge at a grand slam			2
" the @entity46 reached the last four at @entity48 for the first time since 2006 , when she claimed the second of her four grand slam successes			1
in june she beat @entity52 in the final at @entity25 to complete a full set of the majors , and she could potentially face the @entity56 again in a title match in @entity22			1
however , the 10th seed must get past the imposing figure of @entity60 , who needed less than an hour to dispose of fellow former world no. 1 @entity61 in the closing quarterfinal			1
the @entity63 , seeking her fourth @entity3 title but first since 2008 , demolished the @entity65 6 - 1 6 - 3			1
" i felt much better moving , " said the @entity11 and @entity67 champion after winning 26 of her 29 first - serve points and firing 12 aces			2
" i was excited i 'm moving faster			0
" i feel like i 'm going to get more focused and serious and start playing ' @entity71 ' in the next couple of rounds , if i get to play two rounds			2
" @entity52 has lost all three meetings with the 14 - time grand slam champion , with two of those on hard courts in 2009			1
she became the first @entity56 to reach a grand slam semifinal outside of the @entity25 after beating compatriot , best friend and doubles partner @entity85 6 - 2 6 - 4			2
" a quarterfinal with your best friend is difficult , " @entity52 said			2
" there was a lot of tension			0
we know each other very well and have played together many times			0
" normally when we walk out on the court we go together and we speak -- today was a bit strange , especially to see her on the other side of the net			0
" they have reached the semifinals of the doubles event in @entity22 , and next week @entity52 will be ranked as the format 's top player for the first time , with @entity105			1
" it 's the best year of my life			0
i 'm playing very well and my ranking is very high , " said the 25 - year - old , who has won four singles titles in 2012			0
" i just go on the court , fight the best i can and that 's it -- and by winning more matches i get more confidence , and with that you go on the court thinking you can win more than before			0
" meanwhile , 12th seed @entity61 was able to take positives from her defeat , having reached the last eight of a grand slam for the first time since her breakthrough victory at the @entity123			2
" overall i 'm very satisfied , " said the @entity65 , who had never before featured in the @entity22 quarterfinals and who at one stage dropped out of the top 50			1
" i played some really good tennis to get into this position , and even tonight i felt i was striking the ball so nicely on both sides			0
that 's something i 've worked hard for			0
it 's a big step for me			0
