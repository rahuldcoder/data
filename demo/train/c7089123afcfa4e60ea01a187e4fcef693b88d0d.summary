-- you might think you 're a big deal on @entity2			1
but unless you 've got more than 20,000 followers there 's a five - year - old horse out there tweeting you into a cyber hole			1
their posts mostly involve eating carrots and racing , but that has n't stopped champion thoroughbreds @entity14 and @entity15 amassing a legion of followers to rival most b - grade celebrities			1
the pair , along with @entity21 and @entity23 champ i 'll have another , are some of the growing number of racing horses using @entity2 to reach out to fans			1
like any sports star , it 's no longer enough to simply perform well on the turf			2
today , the job of being a champ is an all - encompassing juggernaut of marketing , fanbase and legacy			2
@entity38 is a presence on social media			1
and if it 's good enough for our footballers , tennis players and athletes , then why not our winning horses ? marketing mare their reasons for setting up a @entity2 account are overwhelmingly commercial			1
in short , @entity15 's pr team did it so no one else would			0
" once we trademarked the name ' @entity15 ' we had to protect it and stop unauthorized use , " marketing manager @entity53 told @entity0			0
" the brand ' @entity15 ' is one that 's quality , stylish , feminine , fast , sleek			0
we wanted to stick to that brand			0
" we also believed that this was a good way to communicate with a younger audience			0
" so there 's a definite emphasis on self promotion in @entity15 's feed , with the majority of tweets flagging up media appearances			1
and much like @entity72 sprinter @entity71 urging followers to download the @entity75 app named after him , race horses are also utilizing the marketing power of social media			1
the @entity79 winner recently promoted her own line of equipment : " win 1 of 10 @entity83 9 piece grooming kits visit @entity84			0
" meanwhile @entity14 urged fans to get behind him before racing at @entity87 on wednesday : " thanks for all the tweets , as you can imagine i 'm resting ready for tomorrow ... .10length victory tomorrow i can feel it ... " @entity93 it 's a platform that offers horses -- or at least their managers -- an interactive relationship with fans			1
when @entity100 set up an account for three - year - old bay filly @entity93 , it was in the hope of giving the public a unique insight into owning their own race horse			1
the @entity109 mare bills herself as " @entity111 , " tweeting about everything from enjoying the sunshine to her rigorous training regime			0
instead of the acronym lol , the friendly filly ends her posts with @entity119 ( nay out loud , for the uninitiated )			0
" it gives people a taster so they can experience what it 's like to own a racehorse -- without forking out the money and paying for one , " said @entity120 , pr executive for @entity121 , the commercial arm of the @entity123			1
" people follow her out of curiosity			0
it 's an amusing way of bringing the horse to life			2
" horsing around so @entity93 is n't actually knocking her hooves against the keyboard for our reading pleasure , but according to social media expert @entity139 , that 's half of the appeal			1
the author of " a @entity144 : 365 days in 140 characters " points to the success of @entity147 the cat and the @entity150 cobra as irreverent animals endearing themselves to the cyber masses			0
@entity147 , known simply as " @entity155 's cat , " boasts almost 1.5 million followers			2
and all it took was posts like this : " @entity160 snug snug snug @entity162 roll roll roll relationship status it 's complicated			0
" as @entity139 says : " @entity2 is a format that really does lend itself to humor			2
the whole point is to be pithy			0
" it 's just a funny way to kill a few minutes			2
" paws for thought with an estimated 6 % of all pet dogs in the @entity172 now boasting a @entity2 account , who is behind their newfound digital prowess ? " we 're seeing this parallel trend now of people setting up funny , jokey accounts , " @entity139 said			1
" @entity2 or @entity179 are addictive and it 's proven you get that endorphin buzz if people ' like ' you or retweet you -- even if you 're an anonymous celebrity			1
" much like the cobra that went missing from @entity150 last year , sometimes the simplest headline can spark a social media sensation			1
when a gray - and - white tabby wandered onto the @entity190 pitch during an @entity192 match in february , it became an internet hit			0
the @entity195 and @entity196 match was brought to a standstill and the " @entity199 " quickly assumed its own @entity2 account			2
" @entity204 disappointed @entity205 is n't able to take a penalty , this game has lacked comedy # meow , " is one of the posts that has now attracted more than 75,000 followers			0
the brains behind the hugely popular cat are anonymous			0
but perhaps that 's the perfect excuse to say things your human persona never could .			0
