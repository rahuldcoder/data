-- even before @entity2 came out with its @entity3 five years ago , it was experimenting with @entity5 - like tablets			1
@entity6 did some digging in court filings and unearthed some of the earliest known photos of an @entity5 prototype			1
@entity12 then fleshed out the discovery with color photos of the device next to an actual @entity5			1
called the 035 mockup , the glass - screened device was double the thickness of the first @entity5 , about an inch thick compared to .5 inches for the @entity2 tablet that hit stores in 2010			1
( the latest version of the @entity5 is even thinner , at .37 inches			2
) the mockup is longer and wider than the @entity5 , closer in size to a @entity25 then the current @entity5			1
it has the @entity5 's rounded corners and dark black frame around the screen			2
one feature that 's notably missing is the home button			0
the back is a glossy white shell , similar to the classic ipods , with a nice big @entity2 logo in the middle			0
@entity39 's @entity38 tablet ships this week the court documents are part of the ongoing patent fights between @entity2 and @entity43			1
as part of the case , @entity44 , @entity2 's senior vice president of industrial design , was deposed in december of last year			1
@entity44 was shown the mockup of the big tablet and said , " i recognize this as one of the ... models that we made as part of the design process , as part of the exploration			2
" he believes it was kicking around @entity2 as early as 2002			2
@entity43 is fighting @entity2 's claims the the @entity59 infringes on the @entity5 's design			1
the latest interesting ruling in the case came on thursday , when a @entity64 court said @entity2 had to post a note on its @entity64 site for six months and run a notice in @entity64 newspapers saying that @entity43 did not copy the @entity5 design			1
@entity2 is appealing the ruling			0
the idea that @entity2 was playing with glass - screen tablets before the @entity3 is not new			0
@entity72 first talked about the unusual evolution of the @entity75 product line at the @entity77 conference in 2010			0
" i had this idea about having a glass display , a multitouch display you could type on with your fingers			0
i asked our people about it			0
and six months later , they came back with this amazing display			0
he realized the technology could be used to create a phone , and the rest is history			0
of course , the @entity5 was actually @entity2 's second try at a tablet computer			1
the short - lived @entity93 line was released in 1993			0
