@entity0 , @entity1 -- murder victim @entity6 's family can not forgive anyone until they know the truth about her killing , @entity4 's sister said tuesday as @entity12 flew out of @entity1 , a free woman after four years			1
@entity14 and her @entity1 ex-boyfriend @entity15 were dramatically cleared of the murder monday , in a jury ruling that left @entity14 sobbing and almost unable to walk out of the court unaided			1
the decision stunned the @entity4 family , who were visibly downcast tuesday morning			1
it sends them " back to square one , " @entity4 's brother @entity22 said			1
@entity4 , the victim 's sister , demurred when asked if the family is ready to forgive @entity6 's killer or killers			1
" until the truth comes out , we ca n't forgive anyone , " she said			2
analysis : truth about student 's slaying remains elusive she said the family looked forward to reading the judge 's explanation of how the jury reached its decision , which by law must be published within 90 days			1
not knowing why one jury two years ago convicted @entity14 and @entity15 of murder , sexual assault and other crimes related to @entity4 's killing , while another said monday they are innocent is " the greatest disappointment , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 's mother , meanwhile , did not speak ill of @entity14 , even when asked what she thought of the @entity53 's assertion that her life had been destroyed by the ordeal			1
" that 's probably true in a way , " @entity56 said			0
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity59 said the family accepts the decision , as it accepted the decision in the original trial			0
" we have the utmost respect , obviously , for the decision and the integrity of the court , " he said , adding , " we will abide by that			0
" no end to @entity14 as pop culture obsession @entity14 , who arrived in @entity73 to cheers just after 8 p.m. et , thanked her supporters and those who helped her family in emotional remarks at a brief news conference			1
" i 'm really overwhelmed right now , " she said			0
" i was looking down from the airplane and it seemed like everything was n't real			0
" she told her supporters , " thank you for being there for me			0
" @entity14 spent monday night with her mother before leaving @entity1 , her lawyer @entity86 told @entity2			2
prosecutor @entity88 said tuesday that he will appeal the ruling to @entity1 's @entity90			0
when the appeal reaches the @entity90 , the hearing will be very short and dependent on key technical issues and arguments , not a review of the actual trial itself , according to @entity99 law professor @entity98			0
@entity4 's family said it would support such an appeal , but added it was the state 's decision			1
if @entity1 's highest court overturns the lower court 's decision , it effectively revalidates the trial court 's sentence , which means 26 years in prison for @entity14			1
@entity1 would then have to put in a request to @entity53 authorities for extradition , and it would remain to be seen if that would be granted			0
if the court does not overturn the appeals ruling , @entity14 could not be tried again for the same crime under the " double jeopardy " rule			2
how 4 - year saga unfolded @entity14 and @entity4 were students at @entity0 's university for foreign students when @entity4 's partly clothed body was found stabbed and with her throat slashed in the house they shared			1
monday 's ruling prompted a wave of euphoria by @entity14 , her family and supporters , as well as howls of disapproval outside the courtroom			1
" @entity0 is a quiet town			0
the fact that people came and cry out loud ' shame ' on the ruling means something , " @entity88 said			0
after the ruling , @entity14 broke down sobbing and was escorted out of the courtroom by two people			2
@entity144 : @entity73 reacts to @entity14 's release " we 're thankful that @entity12 's nightmare is over , " @entity14 's sister , @entity146 , said on the courthouse steps			1
" she suffered for four years for a crime she did not commit			0
" co-defendant @entity15 : ' my nightmare ' @entity14 and @entity15 were convicted in 2009 of murder , sexual assault , possession of a weapon , interfering with a crime and theft			1
the jury cleared @entity14 and @entity15 of those charges , freeing them from their respective 26 - and 25 - year sentences			1
but the jury monday upheld @entity14 's conviction on the charge of defamation against @entity6 , an early suspect in the case whom @entity14 accused of killing @entity4			1
@entity168 was arrested , but released after his alibi checked out			0
he later sued @entity170 , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages			0
@entity14 was sentenced monday to three years on the defamation charge , but received credit for the years she has already spent behind bars , her attorney said			2
a third person , drifter @entity6 , was convicted separately of involvement in the killing and is serving 16 years			0
defense teams for @entity14 and @entity15 have suggested @entity182 could have been the sole killer			1
the jury evidently believed @entity14 's impassioned final statement to the court , delivered in a voice trembling with emotion			1
" i am not what they say i am -- perverse , violent			0
... i have n't murdered			0
i have n't stolen , " @entity14 said in the most important speech of her life			2
@entity15 put his claim simply in his own closing statement			2
" i have never hurt anybody , " he said			0
as he concluded , he dramatically removed his plastic " @entity197 and @entity15 " bracelet , saying : " i have never taken it off since it was given to me			2
... i think now is the moment to take it off			0
" following the rulings , @entity14 returned briefly to the prison and was greeted by cheers and shouts of " well done , " said @entity204 , a member of the @entity1 parliament who became an advocate for the 24 - year - old @entity53			2
" her first desire is to lie down on a green field , " he said @entity2 's @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 and journalist @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
