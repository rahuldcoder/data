@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a beautiful morning in my hometown of @entity0 , @entity1 , i sat watching my daughter playing in the park			1
there she was , along with many other kids , swinging , sliding , and running with the kind of pure joy you see only in children			1
behind us lay a green soccer field , filled with two teams of kids competing for nothing but bragging rights and team spirit			2
their parents along the sidelines were enjoying the action			0
my daughter is just 2 years old , but i looked forward to the day i would be one of those parents , cheering her on to victory			0
if it were 60 years ago , many children on this playground and soccer field might have been crippled or died from childhood diseases for which we now have vaccines			1
children growing up in that era were at risk for infections like polio , measles , whooping cough , meningitis , and many other diseases that infect , maim and kill without prejudice or warning			1
all of this changed when some dedicated , hardworking doctors and scientists discovered a way to protect children from these scourges : vaccines			1
like a suit of armor , vaccines shielded children against these infections			1
even better , as more children got vaccinated , that protection extended to kids who could n't be vaccinated , like those who were too young to get shots			1
in the time before vaccines , there were years where measles infected , maimed or killed half a million people ; polio paralyzed nearly 16,000 ; whooping cough infected nearly 150,000 people			1
the victims of these illnesses were mostly children like mine , yours , and those at the park			2
but as children everywhere got vaccinated , communities banished these diseases into medical history			1
by 2001 , there was a 99.99 percent reduction in measles compared with the pre-vaccine era ; the reductions in whooping cough and meningitis were 96 percent and 99 percent , respectively			1
no child gets polio anymore			2
it 's easy to give the credit for that success to doctors and vaccine makers , but it 's really parents and communities who deserve praise			1
they did the hard work of making sure their children and their neighbors ' children got vaccinated			2
for all that success , however , the reputation of vaccines got a black eye about a decade ago , when a doctor in @entity104 called a news conference and dramatically announced that the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine caused autism			1
the shock of that discovery sent ripples of fear through parents and communities in @entity114			0
like a contagion , that fear soon spread to @entity117			0
many parents began refusing to get their kids shots because of a growing anti-vaccination movement			1
that movement , though small , is well - funded , vocal -- even violent at times -- and supported by some prominent people : politicians , doctors , celebrities and media leaders			0
these folks took a claim against one vaccine and , by twisting rumors and innuendo into " evidence , " advanced a conspiracy theory that all childhood vaccines caused autism			1
what nobody knew was that the @entity114 doctor who claimed vaccines caused autism , @entity140 , had his own secrets			1
among them , that he had performed some very risky , invasive experiments on children without approval from the hospital he worked at ; that he had accepted nearly a million dollars from legal firms suing vaccine manufacturers ; and that he had applied for a patent for a replacement vaccine to the one he claimed caused autism , which would have made him a very rich man			1
more important was the fact that anybody who tried to reproduce @entity140 's research could n't get the same results			0
further , study after study on the mmr and other vaccines showed no link between any of them and autism			1
but by the time the truth about @entity140 came out in 2004 , it was too late			0
the notion that vaccines cause autism became conventional wisdom in many places			2
as a result , in pockets of our country , vaccination rates have dropped precipitously			0
and , to nobody 's surprise , that choice has resurrected long - gone diseases			2
in 2008 , a @entity180 , @entity1 , child , whose parents had refused to vaccinate him , returned from vacation with measles , exposing children too young to be vaccinated to the disease			1
any child who had been exposed had to be quarantined for several weeks at home			0
in early 2009 , a child in rural @entity192 died from meningitis caused by the bacteria @entity195			0
his parents had refused to vaccinate him against the disease			0
four other children were hospitalized with the exact same disease			0
two of those were also children of parents who had refused vaccines			2
the fourth was a 5 - month - old baby who was just too young to have been completely immunized			0
the fifth was a child who has an immune deficiency			0
this year , in my home state of @entity1 , more than 900 cases of whooping cough have been recorded so far , up from around 200 last year			1
three months ago , the @entity214 , the journal which first published @entity140 's work , formally retracted his original research paper , expunging its existence from the canon of medical research			0
shortly afterward , he was banned from practicing medicine in the @entity114			0
doctors and scientists may be satisfied with that outcome , but what happens next is n't up to us			0
rather , and just like 60 years ago , it 's up to you			0
you 're going to have to decide whether to vaccinate your children			0
and if you decide , as i hope you do , to protect your children against these deadly diseases , then you 'll be choosing health			2
you 'll be choosing health for your child and family			0
you 'll be choosing health for your community , because every child who 's vaccinated helps to create an ecosystem of protection for those too young to get shots			2
you 'll be choosing to keep your kids out of my doctor 's office and keep them on that playground , in school , on that soccer field , which is right where they belong			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

@entity251 : before vaccines , polio , measles , whooping cough , meningitis *afflicted* children
@entity251 : diseases virtually wiped out , but an anti-vaccine trend *threatens* to bring them back
doctor who linked vaccine with autism has been *discredited* , barred from practice , he writes
as whooping cough cases mount in @entity1 , he says , it 's clear kids need shots
