-- from @entity4 hackers to embarrassing emails about our favorite stars , the recent hack of @entity2 seems to have all the makings of a @entity10 movie			1
and maybe one day it will be			2
after all , there seems to be a new plot twist almost daily , the latest coming wednesday with news that movie theaters across the country were canceling plans to screen " @entity23 " after a group calling itself the @entity19 warned that moviegoers would suffer a " bitter fate " if they went to see the film			2
but as surreal as the @entity2 story sounds , it actually holds a number of valuable lessons on cybersecurity for all of us			1
1 ) different types of cybercrime have different goals			1
the hack of @entity2 has often been lumped in with stories ranging from run of the mill online credit card theft to the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 breaches to the time that @entity45 - linked hackers allegedly " erased data on three - quarters of @entity43 's corporate pcs. " in fact , most of these crimes have little more in common than the fact that they were committed using computers			1
it 's a lot like lumping together every incident in @entity55 that involves a gun , whether it 's a bank robbery , a murder or a football player accidentally shooting himself			1
what made the @entity2 hack distinct is that it mixed an evidently organized effort , using advanced tools ( what is known as an " advanced persistent threat " ) that some have linked to the @entity4 state , but with the goal of maximizing attention and embarrassment for the target			1
that is , they were n't a few hackers phishing after any target , nor were they trying to keep quiet , so that they could continue to secretly exfiltrate data			2
rather , they appear to have wanted to cause havoc -- and make sure everyone knew			2
differentiating between these kinds of threats is critical , because different risks require different types of responses			2
the claims some have made that the @entity2 hack is an act of " cyberterrorism " are a case in point			1
the @entity93 definition of cyberterrorism requires " an act that results in violence , " which stealing scripts about @entity96 carrying out acts of violence would n't meet			2
this also applies to the recent threats by the hackers to create 9/11 style events at any movie theater that shows the film			0
rapidly becoming an illustration on how not to handle online threats , virtually all the major @entity108 theater companies have now said they wo n't show the movie			0
yet the ability to steal gossipy celebrity emails is clearly not the same as having the capacity to undertake physical attacks at thousands of movie theaters across the country			0
so , at least based on their actions so far , the " bitter fate " the hackers promised moviegoers is most likely to be the price they pay for popcorn			0
2 ) there is no such thing as 100 % security			1
there is no perfect security system , and even those organizations that take information security extremely seriously may find that attackers have been successful			1
and while the @entity37 and @entity39 breaches differed greatly , what they shared is that both their it teams were well respected by the cybersecurity industry , and yet they still got hit			0
companies should therefore expect that the bad guys will get in , and , indeed , should plan for it			0
as @entity148 reporter @entity147 put it , " security is n't just about detecting malware -- it 's about preventing it from succeeding in stealing data once on your system			1
" large organizations have to understand their new responsibilities that come with storing large amounts of sensitive information			0
whether it 's your scripts or employee @entity141 numbers , protect it on the inside , not just the outside			1
3 ) your email privacy will not be respected , so act like it			0
one of the stranger aspects of the @entity2 breach is how executives acted like their communications were taking place behind an inviolable wall			1
the sad reality is that as more of our data inevitably finds its way into the public eye , we 'll have to assume that private emails may not always remain private			0
so the rule your parents told you that you should never write something you would n't be ok with seeing in a newspaper holds all the more true now , even as newspapers disappear			0
and if you wo n't listen to your parents , then at least listen to what @entity181 recently told @entity0 on this			0
frankly , this was common sense over a decade ago ; @entity187 's analysts , for example , got caught joking about cheating " @entity188			1
" while it would be great if media outlets ( and the government , for that matter ) respected our email privacy , the fact is that they 'll choose to disclose based on their own protocols			0
indeed , it has been telling that while many of the media outlets called for respecting celebrity privacy when it came to leaked nude photos of celebrities , they have been happy to report on the @entity10 gossip revealed by this hack			1
4 ) the cost of a cybersecurity breach is n't just about the technical cleanup			0
when businesses think about the costs of a cybersecurity incident , they usually only contemplate the hard numbers on the technical side , roughly the cost of the technical and legal investigation and cleanup added to the business lost from being knocked offline			0
with this in mind , some have estimated this particular breach may cost @entity2 as much as $ 100 million			1
the reality , as the studio is now experiencing , is that the costs often go well beyond			0
the hit for the firm encompasses everything from future business opportunities missed to lost customer trust to a certainly unwanted new role in the debate over gender pay disparity			0
this means that while most of us wo n't have to face a lifetime of icy stares from @entity240 , we do need to think of cybercosts in a different , broader way			0
indeed , a survey by @entity244 of business executives found that only 39 % of them weighed the impact of a cyberattack on their brand image and only 25 % on lost secrets and other intellectual property			2
this gap is important , because how you weigh the potential costs shapes what you are willing to do to prevent them			2
5 ) attribution is hard , and sometimes does n't matter			0
victims understandably want to know who hit them , but knowing with certainty who is responsible for an attack is incredibly difficult			0
in the @entity2 case , most signs point to @entity4 linked hackers ; the government of @entity4 had expressed deep anger over " @entity23 , " and there are similarities to other attacks traced back to @entity4 in certain reported attack techniques			1
but these are mostly context - based , good enough so far only for the court of public opinion			0
but even if we felt a high degree of confidence , it 's unclear what @entity2 could or should do next			1
@entity4 's government would likely still deny its direct involvement even in the case of damning evidence			2
and even if it admitted its role , @entity2 's actual recourse appears to be limited			1
this means that whether one is looking at the @entity2 breach , the @entity45 hack of the @entity288 or the massive @entity290 campaign of theft of corporate secrets , the real problem is n't one of attribution , but accountability .			1

@entity299 and @entity300 : @entity2 hack has lessons for us all
it 's important not to treat all cybercrime the same , *authors* say
there is no such thing as 100 % security , they argue
