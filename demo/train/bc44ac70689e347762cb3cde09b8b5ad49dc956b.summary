@entity0 -- the @entity3 will receive a classified document thursday that seeks to justify the administration 's policy of targeting @entity7 overseas via drone attacks , chairwoman @entity2 said			1
" i am pleased that the president has agreed to provide the @entity3 with access to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations , " the @entity10 @entity9 said in a statement wednesday			2
" it is critical for the committee 's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations			0
" the announcement came shortly after an administration official said president @entity27 had yielded to demands that he turn over to @entity29 the classified @entity31 legal advice that seeks to justify the policy			2
" today , as part of the president 's ongoing commitment to consult with @entity29 on national security matters , the president directed the @entity31 to provide the @entity29 intelligence committees access to classified @entity14 advice related to the subject of the @entity31 white paper , " an administration official said wednesday			0
the 16 - page white paper -- titled " @entity43 who is a senior operational leader of @entity45 or an @entity46 " -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document			1
that policy paper was sent to key congressional committees last year but became public just this week			0
the president , the official said , was turning over the legal opinion related to the policy because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy			0
the @entity3 is expected to receive the document the same day @entity27 's pick for @entity59 director , @entity58 , faces a confirmation hearing			1
@entity58 's hearing thursday comes amid complaints from senators , including several @entity64 , about secrecy surrounding the drone policy			1
@entity67 also weighed in on the debate , saying @entity29 should grill @entity58 on his claim that the @entity27 administration 's drone strikes are " conducted in full compliance with the law			1
" @entity74 says it has footage from downed @entity7 drone " furthermore , @entity29 should immediately hold public hearings with independent experts to examine the administration 's legal reasoning and ensure that the administration is following the ' rule book ' for the use of lethal force that already exists : international human rights law and , in the very narrow circumstances to which it applies , international humanitarian law , " the group said			1
in a 2012 speech at the @entity91 in @entity0 , @entity58 asserted that the drone strikes are legal under the @entity94 resolution passed by @entity29 after the 9/11 attacks			1
in addition , " there is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield , at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat , " @entity58 said at the time			2
this does not appear to be the view of @entity113 , @entity115 special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights , who announced plans in october to investigate @entity7 drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties			1
opinion : @entity58 , @entity27 's counterterrorist the drone campaign against @entity45 and its allies has been one of @entity58 's biggest legacies in the four years he was the president 's principal adviser on terrorism			1
according to a count by the public policy group @entity131 , at least 28 of @entity45 's leading members have been killed in drone strikes , including the @entity7 citizen @entity133 , who played an operational role in @entity135			1
@entity137 's teenage son died in a separate strike			0
on wednesday , the chairman of the @entity140 said the attack that killed @entity133 was justified			0
" this is somebody who had said that he did n't want his @entity7 citizenship anymore , " rep. @entity142 , @entity143 , told @entity147 's " @entity146			2
" he said @entity133 had officially joined @entity45 , and @entity45 had declared war on the @entity7			1
" " the legal basis of this goes back many , many years when @entity7 citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the @entity7 , " @entity142 said			2
" so what they were saying is , once you 've made that choice , you no longer get the protections that you would			0
i mean , if you join the enemy overseas , you join the enemy overseas			0
and we 're going to fight the enemy overseas			0
" in his speech at the @entity91 , @entity58 said drone strikes are " ethical " because of " the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage ; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an @entity45 terrorist and innocent civilians			1
" and @entity27 himself defended it in an appearance last october on " @entity177			0
" " there are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world , and you 've got to make a call and it 's not optimal , " he said			0
" and sometimes you 've got to make some tough calls			0
but you can do so in a way that 's consistent with international law and with @entity7 law			2
" opinion : bring drones out of the shadows			0
