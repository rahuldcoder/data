-- many @entity1 were stunned when the @entity2 released a study last month showing that suicide now kills more @entity1 than car accidents			1
but as a primary care doctor , i am not surprised			0
over the past decade , the period in which suicide deaths spiked , i have witnessed how the @entity1 health care system approaches the treatment of depression			1
it is outdated and ineffective , and it too often fails at protecting @entity1 from the consequences of mental illness			1
with each passing year , the @entity1 falls further behind other countries in finding cost - effective ways to care for our citizens ' mental health			1
on monday , president @entity22 and vice president @entity23 are holding a conference at the @entity25 aimed at broadening access to mental health care and removing the stigma from seeking treatment			2
they have their work cut out for them			0
depression is a leading cause of disability in the @entity1 most people with depression will see a primary care doctor before they see anyone else			1
we physicians are supposed to identify depression , help patients get the right treatment , and prevent suicide			1
but every time i see a patient with depression , i feel my hands are tied			2
yes , i can prescribe an antidepressant and adjust the dose , but many depressed patients also need psychotherapy , more intensive medication management , and close follow - up			0
i can not get them all the treatments they need			0
in the @entity1 , mental health treatment is largely delivered by specialists who are not integrated into primary care clinics			1
it is reimbursed separately , often with restrictions on the number of visits and at a high cost to patients			0
the best i can do with a depressed patient who is not responding to initial treatment is to say , " i can give you a referral , but you need to check with your insurance company to see if it will pay for this			2
" often the patients do not follow through -- either because the wait time to see a mental health provider is too long , they can not afford the treatment , or they are simply too depressed to act on the referral			2
the @entity80 projects that by 2030 , depression will be the leading cause of disability in the world , with huge economic and social costs			1
even some developing countries are surpassing the @entity1 in creating innovative and effective ways to deal with this coming tide			1
the @entity1 @entity89 , passed in 2010 , requires insurance companies to provide equal coverage for mental health and may improve depression care for @entity1			1
the @entity94 will also expand mental health benefits to 62 million more @entity1 by including mental health as an @entity96 and by mandating mental health parity within the health insurance exchanges			1
however , in light of ongoing state budget and sequestration cuts , mental health services continue to erode			0
in april , for example , the @entity104 governor of @entity105 revoked $ 7.2 million in funding for mental health			0
as shocking as this was to mental health advocates , policymakers across the country -- even in comparatively liberal states like @entity105 -- are arguing that in the face of other urgent and competing priorities , strengthening the mental health system is too expensive for states to pursue			0
but that would n't be true if we consider alternative , more cost - effective delivery models			2
in a rigorous study in @entity123 , which has very scarce resources , researchers trained community members to deliver group interpersonal therapy to depressed men and women in 30 villages			1
the groups met weekly for four months			0
during the meetings , participants shared their experiences , and the group leader facilitated support and suggestions for change from other group members			0
this approach dramatically reduced the percent of people in the study with depression , from 80 % to 28 % , and improved people 's ability to do the things that matter most , such as taking care of their children and themselves , going to work , and socializing			0
countries such as @entity151 and @entity152 , which have huge populations and many competing economic and social priorities , are also experimenting with task - shifting , in which mental health counseling can be delivered by lay health workers trained to provide scientifically sound counseling with supervision			1
the benefits go beyond cost reduction			0
studies in @entity152 show that lay health workers also help people to better accept mental illness and necessary treatments			2
to be sure , some mental health innovation can also be found in parts of the @entity1 @entity170 , partly funded by the @entity171 , is using telephone and internet technology to link specialists at the @entity175 with primary care doctors , community health workers , and health educators in rural parts of the state			1
through technology , specialists train and support nonspecialists in treating people with mental illness and addiction , a lethal combination that often leads to suicide			0
suicide is the culmination of many complex forces			0
but it is often preceded by mental illness that could have been treated			0
the dramatic spike in suicide deaths among @entity1 is a stark warning to those in charge of the @entity1 health care system			1
if the @entity1 ignores the innovation and alternative delivery models that are advancing mental health care in other parts of the world , the cost will continue to be measured in @entity1 lives			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity211 : @entity2 says suicide kills more americans than car accidents
depression is leading disability in @entity1 , which lags on treatment , she says
she says nations like @entity123 , @entity151 , @entity152 find training community to help is effective
@entity211 : the @entity1 must get ahead of depression *epidemic*
