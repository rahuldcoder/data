-- as the @entity4 prepares to build its first new nuclear power reactors in three decades , concerns about an early generation of plants have resurfaced since last year 's disaster in @entity7			1
the @entity9 nuclear power plant -- the subject of a battle between state authorities and the @entity13 over its continued operation -- uses one of 23 @entity4 reactors built with a @entity18 - designed containment housing known as the @entity19 it 's the same design that was used at @entity7 's @entity22 nuclear power plant , where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed @entity7 's historic earthquake in march 2011			1
the disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes			0
@entity18 says the @entity19 design has operated safely for more than 40 years and has been modified periodically to meet changing regulations			1
no nuclear plant could have avoided a meltdown after being swamped by a tsunami and losing power to cooling systems for an extended period of time , the company says -- and at least one expert @entity0 spoke to agrees			2
but concerns about the @entity19 's ability to contain the consequences of a severe accident have been raised for decades , and critics say the @entity22 accident shows it ca n't survive a real - world disaster			1
the structure was designed so steam that builds up in an overheating reactor can be diverted into a doughnut - shaped water tank known as the suppression pool , or torus , where it condenses back to water to reduce pressure inside the reactor containment building			0
that allows utilities to build a much smaller containment structure -- as little as one - sixth the size of those used at some @entity4 plants			2
@entity66 , a former top safety official at what was then the @entity68 , warned in 1971 that in an accident in which the core slowly loses coolant and overheats , the @entity19 containment " would overpressurize			1
that could lose the torus water source , hence @entity76 [ emergency core cooling system ] as well as leak out fission products			0
" read the 1971 @entity68 document ( @entity79 ) in 1978 , the @entity13 , which replaced the @entity68 , decided that the design was safe			2
@entity66 agreed with that decision , which @entity18 and plant operators have pointed out			1
but the following year , there was a partial meltdown at @entity85 in @entity86			0
@entity85 used an entirely different design , but the @entity13 began an extensive safety review after the accident that resulted in several changes to the @entity19 one of those was a 1989 push for utilities to install a vent system that would release steam from the containment during an emergency			1
but as critics point out , that also raises the odds that radioactive material will escape the containment -- even with a " hardened " vent , one that tries to filter out the reactor byproducts			0
read the 1989 @entity13 recommendation for @entity4 nuclear plants to install vents ( @entity79 ) " a hardened vent is just a way of saying we 're going to uncontain the containment , " said @entity107 , a former physicist at the @entity108 in @entity109 , who took part in the @entity13 review			2
" the question comes up now -- and this is a really important question -- can the @entity19 containment be made better ? " @entity117 , a former nuclear engineer and a leading critic of the @entity9 plant , says the @entity7 accident shows the @entity19 containment system ca n't prevent a release of radioactivity in a meltdown			1
watch an excerpt from @entity0 's @entity127 report on @entity9 in an october hearing before the @entity13 's @entity130 , he said the vents were a " @entity133 fix " for the design that failed " not once , not twice , but three times " at @entity22			2
" true wisdom means knowing when to modify something and knowing when to stop , " said @entity117 , who leads a state commission set up to monitor the @entity9 plant			0
half of @entity4 reactors are more than 30 years old the @entity13 has rejected a petition by anti-nuclear groups to immediately shut down all reactors using the @entity18 @entity19 containment			1
but it said it would examine several of the issues the petitioners raised as part of its review of the @entity7 disaster			1
@entity107 called the @entity19 containment the smallest and weakest of those used in @entity4 plants			1
but he said the @entity13 " punted " in the face of industry resistance by calling only for utilities to install vents			0
as for @entity18 , he said , " they got the rule book from the federal government , and they said ' this is all you have to design it for			2
' the real question is : what should have been done after 1979 , when you found out the rule book was flawed ? " @entity18 says it has made several changes to the @entity19 design since 1980 aimed at improving safety in the event of an accident			1
the manufacturer , which has a partnership with @entity7 industrial giant @entity174 , stands by its product and says the tsunami that struck @entity22 would have devastated any plant			1
" there is no nuclear plant operating today that would have performed differently , " @entity179 spokesman @entity178 told @entity0			0
@entity107 agrees that no power station could have survived the long - term loss of power that occurred at the @entity7 plant without a meltdown			2
but he noted that at @entity85 , the worst @entity4 accident to date , there were " essentially zero emissions " from its much larger containment structure			0
" from the point of view of public safety , that 's a home run , " he said			0
@entity178 said the nuclear industry is still studying what happened in @entity7 , " and there will undoubtedly be lessons learned that will need to be implemented across the industry and across all types of nuclear plants , including the @entity19 " but he added , " the @entity18 @entity19 containment structure design is a proven , reliable technology			1
it fulfills all regulatory requirements in one of the most highly regulated industries in the world			0
" commission : @entity4 nukes are safe , but ... @entity7 will need decades to clean up after @entity22 , the world 's worst nuclear accident since @entity215 in 1986			1
about 110,000 people are still displaced from homes , a @entity7 government commission reported in december			0
a 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) radius around the plant remains off - limits			0
workers have peered only briefly into the damaged reactor buildings , and experts say a full damage report may take years			0
" we need still a little bit more time to find out what really happened , " said @entity226 , a nuclear engineering professor at the @entity228			0
" it took three years at @entity85 to be able to open up the pressure vessel , " @entity226 said			0
" so we 're not quite there yet			0
" 2011 nuclear power report : no changes needed @entity238 nuclear plant cited for safety violations the @entity4 nuclear industry has n't built a new reactor since @entity85			1
but on february 9 , the @entity13 approved two new reactors at the @entity244 nuclear plant in @entity245			2
the reactors are of a different design than the @entity18 plants at @entity22 and in the @entity4			1
@entity0 's @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 oks new nuclear reactors a year after @entity7 disaster
23 ge @entity19 reactors in @entity4 share same design as @entity22 plant
many are aging , but have *undergone* safety improvements
@entity18 says design is proven , reliable technology that is safe to use
