the @entity1 government has thrown down the gauntlet to the jihadists of @entity4 and their fellow travelers in @entity6 -- and insists its goal is nothing short of eradicating these militant groups			1
it is a major undertaking , even with @entity12 logistical and intelligence help and the prospect of reinforcement from @entity17 states			0
and the outcome is far from assured			0
@entity19 seeks to push @entity21 groups out of northern @entity6 's key cities as well as smaller towns dotted through this vast region			1
but these groups have had nine months to establish defenses and a chain of command and improve their arsenals			0
as i found out last summer on a journey north from the capital , @entity34 , into the dusty heartlands of @entity6 , the seizure of the north by @entity21 groups has traumatized tens of thousands of civilians			1
many have fled their homes ; others have endured hunger or cruel punishment for " offenses " that did n't exist before the @entity44 arrived			0
so ordinary @entity6 are welcoming the @entity1 intervention			1
but their enthusiasm may wear off , if the result is prolonged urban warfare and destruction			1
on my trip up the @entity54 last june , one of the few roads in @entity6 worthy of the description , i met @entity55 , a noted @entity56 artisan from @entity57			2
at that point , @entity6 's security forces had melted away in the face of the @entity44 ' advance			1
@entity62 told me he had seen no vestige of the state in @entity65 , a town of some 50,000 people , contradicting the assertion of a high - ranking military officer who assured me his forces were deployed there -- precisely to deter a possible push southward by the @entity44			0
in reality , @entity65 was in the middle of an ungoverned buffer - zone rather than a well - guarded front - line town			0
and it stayed that way for months , perhaps lulling foreign governments and even the @entity6 army into a false sense of security			2
that is until last week , when militants of @entity4 made a sudden move southward to take the town and get within striking distance of the important town of @entity88 and the airport at @entity90			0
that provoked the immediate arrival of @entity1 air and ground forces in @entity6 to help local troops push back the advancing jihadis			1
over the weekend @entity98 warplanes launched sorties against @entity100 , near the border with @entity102 , as well as the key hub of @entity104 and the town of @entity106			0
now @entity1 armored personnel carriers are heading north from @entity34			2
the @entity108 is pledging to help the transport of troops from neighboring @entity17 states , and the @entity12 will employ its vast technical capabilities to assist in the overall operations			0
but @entity1 will be the essential external actor in the conflict			2
@entity6 's meltdown began in mid-january of last year when the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , an ethnic @entity56 separatist outfit , and @entity4 , a newly formed @entity119 - jihadi group , attacked the northeastern town of @entity121			1
following a succession of lighting raids by heavily armed rebel groups in late march 2012 , @entity6 security forces evacuated three northern regions : @entity104 , @entity57 and @entity127			1
@entity6 's army , national police and paramilitary gendarme force , who had been stationed in the north , relocated to the safety of garrisons and cinder - block station houses south of a rapidly created front line			1
and for a while the disparate rebel movements worked together in an ad hoc alliance despite their very different ideologies and goals			0
but before long the highly divergent agendas of @entity4 and the @entity117 led to clashes between them			0
@entity4 is led by a @entity56 by the name of @entity145 -- a veteran separatist - turned - @entity21			2
however , @entity148 's @entity4 is just one of three salafi - jihadi groups in northern @entity6			1
his turban - clad men were soon joined by the @entity153 contingent of the @entity155 - led @entity154 ( @entity154 ) and another hitherto unknown group , the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) , believed to be run by a @entity102 national named @entity158			0
on december 7 , 2012 , the @entity159 listed @entity158 as a " @entity160			0
" the loss of the north -- and resentment among army officers that they were inadequately equipped to fight the rebellion -- led to a coup against the democratically elected president , @entity167			0
he was overthrown by a military junta led by an obscure army captain @entity170 , who accused him of appeasement when dealing with @entity154 and @entity56 separatists			0
the well - armed @entity21 groups may have decided not to advance further south after their initial seizure of territory because they were occupied in consolidating their power in the areas already under their control			1
a fragile status quo left the international community with the illusion that there was sufficient time to plan for military action , while leaving room for negotiations that might lead to a political solution			0
the @entity1 were the most bullish in supporting military intervention by @entity190 ( @entity190 ) , but the scale of the task was recognized as enormous			1
the @entity6 military was low on morale and equipment , the distances vast and the territory difficult			2
@entity6 's neighbors dithered with their own military planning as a series of fruitless , drawn - out talks with various rebel factions were led by @entity203 , @entity204 's longtime president and his foreign minister , @entity206			1
president @entity203 , a one - time confidant of the late @entity208 dictator @entity207 , has a reputation for meddling in the affairs of his @entity17 neighbors , including past conflicts in @entity213 , @entity214 , and @entity215			0
much to the consternation of pro-junta @entity6 hardliners , @entity204 invited the rebels to talks at a plush @entity221 hotel and sent a high - level delegation to @entity104 and @entity127 led by @entity206			2
@entity223 , the recently ousted transitional prime minister in @entity6 ( and former @entity225 scientist ) said in november that he was open to talks in @entity204 with both the @entity117 and the jihadists of @entity4 on the condition that they were @entity6 citizens with a purely @entity6 agenda			2
soon thereafter , he lost his job -- once again displaying the complete dysfunction of @entity6 politics			2
it seems @entity223 's initiative ran afoul captain @entity236 , who wields considerable influence despite formally handing over to a civilian president			0
on december 20 , the @entity242 @entity241 passed resolution 2085 under @entity244 of the @entity245 , allowing for the eventual creation and deployment of international troops in @entity6			2
the @entity242 allowed for the creation of @entity17 - led @entity250 in @entity6 ( @entity251 ) in concert with @entity190 and the @entity253			2
members of the international community hoped for certain benchmarks to be met among @entity6 's political elites and the military junta that still wields considerable power			1
but it seems @entity4 and @entity156 were operating on their own strategic timetable , catching many off guard -- including civilians who were forced to flee the fighting			0
the @entity12 has watched the deteriorating situation in @entity6 with concern -- but with no appetite for direct intervention			1
after the september attack on the @entity12 diplomatic compound in @entity272 , secretary of state @entity269 seemed to suggest that there may have been a link between @entity154 operating freely in @entity6 's ungoverned spaces and the tragedy in eastern @entity208			1
" they [ @entity154 ] are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions under way in @entity281 , as we tragically saw in @entity272 , " she said			0
but it 's been difficult to stitch together a coalition of @entity17 countries willing or able to go to war on behalf of @entity6 's weak civilian government			1
many of @entity6 's neighbors were rightly concerned about the prospect of a wider regional conflict and the risk of terrorist blowback at home			1
and they were concerned that a substantial part of @entity6 's population might not welcome them			1
these are not states with well - trained @entity300 , nor the airlift or support to inject a sizeable presence into hostile territory			0
but now at least seven west @entity17 countries are ready to supply troops to a regional intervention force			0
the two principle hawks on @entity6 have been @entity1 president @entity309 and @entity311 president @entity310 ( who 's offering soldiers to the @entity190 force ) , two leaders who believe they may have the most to lose , should @entity6 's conflict worsen			1
@entity1 still has a number of hostages in northern @entity6 , including four of its citizens captured by @entity6 - based militants in neighboring @entity311 in 2010 while working for @entity320 , the @entity1 uranium mining consortium			1
@entity154 has been holding the men as bargaining chips and could potentially execute them in response to the @entity1 intervention			1
in @entity311 , president @entity310 fears armed conflict ( and a tide of refugees ) could spill into the country 's northern regions and re-ignite its own @entity56 troubles			0
despite the relatively small number of militant fighters , there is little simple about the @entity1 operation			2
the distances are huge , the geography difficult , and the risk of neighboring countries being dragged into @entity6 's crisis can not be discounted			1
the @entity1 defense minister has acknowledged that the militants are a determined adversary that is well equipped			0
it will take more than a few air strikes to dislodge them .			0

@entity19 seeks to push @entity21 groups out of northern @entity6 's key cities
@entity1 insists its goal is nothing short of eradicating these militant groups
flood : most ordinary @entity6 are welcoming the @entity1 intervention
but enthusiasm may wear off if result is prolonged urban warfare , he says
