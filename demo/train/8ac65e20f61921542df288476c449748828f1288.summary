@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly 10 years after the deadly crash of an @entity6 jet , a trial began tuesday to determine who 's to blame for the doomed flight			1
the judge began the trial by reading out the names of all 113 people who were killed when the plane burst into flames and smashed into a hotel on july 25 , 2000			1
three @entity1 people responsible for the design , testing and certification of the @entity6 face charges of involuntary manslaughter			1
also on trial are @entity22 and two of its @entity25 employees , accused of the same crime because a @entity22 jet was found to have played a key role in the crash			1
the @entity25 were not present for the opening day			0
the head of an organization representing the victims of disasters criticized the trial as it began			2
@entity35 of @entity36 said the trial would be a dehumanized battle of experts as @entity22 and @entity38 sought to blame each other			1
@entity38 is not on trial			2
a lawyer representing @entity22 said @entity6 's problems were apparent decades before the crash			1
then - @entity1 president @entity45 told his @entity46 in 1980 that the @entity6 needed to be improved , lawyer @entity44 said tuesday			2
@entity47 , who was president at the time of the @entity6 crash , saw it take place and reportedly said @entity6 is dead , @entity44 said			0
in fact , that is what @entity45 should have said in 1980 , he argued			0
@entity44 said the trial should be suspended because it is not fair to @entity22 , but presiding judge @entity56 said she would not rule on the request until after some expert testimony , which could take months			1
an investigation revealed a tragic chain of events that brought down @entity63 shortly after takeoff from @entity0 ' @entity66 airport : a tire under the left wing blew on takeoff when it struck a small strip of titanium metal on the runway			1
the blown tire sent debris into the wing , causing the fuel tank to rupture and sparking the catastrophic fire that led to the crash , which killed 100 passengers , nine crew and four people on the ground			1
@entity44 said the plane was on fire before it hit the metal fragment			2
according to the charges , the @entity6 engineers on trial could have acted much earlier to correct well - known design flaws in the plane , whose tanks had insufficient protection from debris			2
prosecutors are likely to present evidence that because of its higher - than - normal takeoff speeds , there were more than 60 tire blowouts over the @entity6 's 25 years in the air			0
only one @entity6 ever crashed			0
the titanium strip that is said to have played a major role in the crash allegedly fell off a @entity102 , which took off just before the @entity6			0
judicial investigators say the strip was improperly installed on the @entity102 engine , prompting the charges against the airline and two of its employees			0
@entity38 and @entity110 introduced supersonic commercial service in 1976 , but the disaster , combined with high maintenance costs and falling passenger numbers , led both airlines to retire the @entity116 in 2003			0
the trial is expected to last about four months			0
@entity2 's @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report			0
