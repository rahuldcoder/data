@entity0 -- @entity2 , the @entity3 , the @entity4 ... the leading horse - racing nations of the world all have a showpiece event that makes aficionados and casual observers alike stop in their tracks for 10 short minutes as a nation collectively bates its breath over the winner			1
but few sporting venues can match the rich history and heritage of @entity19 's @entity18			1
the @entity21 racecourse celebrates its tri-centenary this year -- it was founded in 1711 by @entity23 -- with its 300 years of pageantry , fashion and traditions firmly intact			1
as well as being one of the most important elite race meetings in the world , this week 's @entity18 is the jewel in the crown of the @entity21 " summer season " -- a whirl of society events in the warmest months of the year that includes the likes of rowing 's @entity37 and the @entity39			1
" to our mind , since the middle of the 19th century @entity18 has always been the pinnacle of the whole season , " explains @entity40 , chief executive of @entity18			2
" people like to come out , see their friends , dress up and enjoy a great day at the races			0
" @entity49 famously described the races as " a garden party with racing tacked on			0
" in fact , many of the classical social occasions that make up the @entity21 season are , first and foremost , world - class sporting events			2
the @entity21 season traces its origins back to the 17th century , although its heyday arguably came in the @entity61 era			2
originally devised to keep everyone entertained while @entity64 was still sitting , the season has not only survived into the 21st century , but the events that make up the season are , for the most part , more popular than ever			0
purists cite the duration of the season as running from @entity71 to august 12 , when grouse shooting begins			0
but it is with @entity18 , a perennial favorite of the current @entity75 , that the season seems properly to get underway each year			1
@entity18 occupies a distinctive place in @entity19 popular culture : it 's no coincidence that @entity81 's character in the film " @entity83 " was unveiled as a fully paid - up member of the upper classes at @entity18			1
the mystique lies in its long association with @entity19 's royal family			1
nestled in the @entity21 countryside just six miles from @entity90 , on land still owned by the @entity94 , successive generations of royal patronage have endowed @entity18 with many of its unique traditions			2
not least of which is the @entity23 's arrival each day by horse - drawn carriage			1
" because it 's effectively an event which is royal , the royal family arrives by carriage , " @entity40 says			2
" @entity23 says ' hello ' to a few people then she goes up into her private box , where she watches racing all day			0
" sometimes she 'll come down and see horses in the parade ring , some days she 'll present prizes , and if she 's got a runner she 'll go down to the pre-parade ring to see them saddled			0
" @entity75 has a well - documented interest in all things equestrian , and has been attending @entity18 since before her reign began in 1952			1
" the industry 's tremendously pleased that we have a monarch who 's so keen , " @entity40 says			0
" she 's probably been coming to @entity18 more than anybody else ! " known for her love of racing , the @entity23 has enjoyed more than 20 winners at the @entity123 course 's blue riband event -- a streak that began with her first victory in the @entity126 with @entity127 in 1952			1
the real spectacle of @entity18 , however , is arguably the fashion -- in particular the hats			1
the wearing of hats is another tradition that traces its origins to the royals : it was not considered respectful to have one 's head uncovered in the presence of the monarch			2
the @entity23 is often at the center of feverish speculation as to what color and style of hat she will wear on a given day			0
on @entity143 , the hats often range from the exquisite to the eccentric			0
as one of the few remaining social occasions that requires ladies to wear hats , in recent years fashionistas have raised the bar with sculptural designs that are works of art in their own right			0
as the celebrated course celebrates the busiest week of its 300 - year history , @entity40 knows the eyes of the world will be on @entity18 from june 14 - 18			1
" it 's this fantastic pageant : amazing carriages , wonderful colors , the best thoroughbred horses flashing past , an opportunity for people to dress up in top hat and tails and lovely hats			0
to me , it is just the best race meeting in the world			0

@entity19 's most *glamorous* horse - racing event celebrates its tri-centenary this week
@entity18 is the jewel in the crown of the @entity21 summer " season "
@entity75 has been attending @entity18 since before her reign began
the real spectacle of @entity18 is arguably the fashion -- in particular the hats
