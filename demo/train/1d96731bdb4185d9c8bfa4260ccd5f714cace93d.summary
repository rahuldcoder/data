-- 2005 champions @entity2 take on neighbors and arch - rivals @entity4 in the @entity7 quarterfinals this weekend -- their first tennis clash since becoming independent nations following the break - up of the old @entity11			1
the tie in @entity13 gives @entity2 home advantage , but in terms of world rankings @entity4 , headed by @entity15 , will start as narrow favorites to reach the last four			1
what is guaranteed is a tinderbox atmosphere in a @entity21 filled to the brim with about 1,000 @entity4 fans in the 10,000 capacity crowd			2
mindful of recent incidents at the @entity26 where @entity4 and @entity28 fans have been involved in ugly scuffles , extra security measures have been laid on by local police			0
@entity11 reached the @entity7 semifinals three times , the last being in 1991 , the year @entity2 declared independence , leading to a bloody @entity36 war with the @entity4			1
fortunately , relations have improved at all levels between the countries and @entity15 told @entity0 's @entity40 earlier this year that players in the @entity2 team were among his best friends on the circuit			1
" i mostly get along with tennis players from my country , from @entity4 , @entity49 , and from @entity2 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , all these guys that i speak the same language with , it gets easier to have a friendship with and have a good connection , " he revealed			1
that friendship will be put aside when action in the best - of - five tie gets underway on friday with the opening singles rubbers			0
@entity2 have been hit by injuries to @entity51 and big - serving @entity64 , with @entity50 coming out of @entity7 retirement especially for this tie			1
with the reshuffles , a heavy weight of expectation falls on the shoulders of @entity2 number one , 21 - year - old @entity52 , who said the tie was going to be a " memory for life			2
" " it 's going to be a clash of two great nations , " he told the official @entity7 website			2
" there 's going to be a lot of tension in the air but hopefully everything is going to go all right			0
" @entity52 , who lost in the first round at @entity87 , like @entity50 is at his best on the indoor hard court surface being used in @entity13			0
they will need to be with @entity15 , newly installed as world number two , leading a @entity4 team boasting @entity92 , @entity49 and doubles world number one @entity93			1
@entity15 is confident of victory but also wary of @entity2 's home advantage			1
" given the quality of our team , it is logical to expect victory , " he told his official website			0
" of course , it is hard to predict what will happen there , because being a host in @entity7 matches is an advantage			0
@entity15 wants top spot in rankings " but , as i said , we have quality , which we 've been confirming years back and we can challenge any team on any surface in any country			2
i am optimistic , " he added			0
@entity4 knocked out the @entity115 3 - 2 in their last 16 @entity7 tie to reach the quarterfinals for the first time but @entity15 wants them to go all the way			1
" we have a good chance to pass the @entity2 , and i think we can go all the way to the finals , " he concluded			0
@entity15 opens against @entity50 in the first singles match friday , with @entity52 then playing @entity92			0
in saturday 's key doubles clash , @entity2 @entity125 and @entity126 are up against @entity49 and @entity93			2
in other ties , defending champions @entity128 will be without world number one and @entity87 champion @entity132 as they take on @entity133 at @entity134			1
@entity128 are bidding for a hat - trick of titles while @entity133 are hampered by the loss through injury of their top - ranked player @entity139			2
