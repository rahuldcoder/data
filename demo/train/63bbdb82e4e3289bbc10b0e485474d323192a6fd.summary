a @entity1 executive said saturday that a cyberattack was to blame for the network woes that have been plaguing playstation and others since christmas day			1
" the video game industry has been experiencing high levels of traffic designed to disrupt connectivity and online gameplay , " @entity7 , @entity1 's vice president of @entity8 said on @entity5 's blog			1
" multiple networks , including @entity16 , have been affected over the last 48 hours			2
@entity16 engineers are working hard to restore full network access and online gameplay as quickly as possible , " she said			2
" if you received a @entity5 console over the holidays and have been unable to log onto the network , know that this problem is temporary and is not caused by your game console , " @entity21 wrote			1
@entity31 's @entity30 network also were hobbled by a slowdown on one of the busiest gaming days of the year			1
but , unlike @entity1 , @entity36 spokesman @entity35 told @entity2 that " we do n't share info on the root cause of specific issues			1
" @entity5 gamers exasperated @entity21 's announcement was an about - face compared to @entity1 's previous messages since the ordeal began -- mostly tweets that were sparse , vague and almost always ended with ' thank you for your continued patience			1
" but based on the overall sentiment expressed in the comments posted to message boards and on @entity50 , the collective patience among @entity5 users had long since run out -- especially when rival @entity36 appeared to be back online			1
" @ @entity55 any chance you guys could consult with # xboxlive engineers on how to get # psn back up ? " @ robbhunt asked on @entity50			0
" they seem to have things figured out			0
" @ @entity63 _ tweeted a picture of her entertainment console at her house in @entity67 with this caption : " i wish @entity16 would come back online			0
bought hubby a @entity70 for @entity71			0
only thing its good for right now is a tv stand			0
" a great deal of the contempt however was reserved for @entity76 , a band of black - hat hackers who said from the get - go that they were behind the attack			1
" this is so frustrating , " wrote calin75			0
" the hackers think they 're hurting @entity1 , but the ones that really pay for this bull crap are the innocent users			1
" @entity2 can not confirm the identity or claims of @entity76 , but @entity1 's acknowledgment that this was indeed a cyberattack gives little reason to doubt their claims			1
in august , the group said it took down the @entity16 in the same fashion : by flooding it with illegitimate traffic , something called a distributed denial - of - service attack ( @entity98 ) in the video game world			0
as @entity101 reported at the time , when @entity102 , president of @entity103 , tweeted about those " large scale " attacks , he became a @entity76 target himself -- even at 30,000 feet			2
" we have been receiving reports that @ j_smedley 's plane @entity110 from @entity111 to @entity112 has explosives on - board , please look into this , " the group tweeted to @entity107 , resulting in the flight being diverted			0
earlier this month , @entity1 was again hit with a similar outage			2
@entity76 not only took credit for that one too , but it promised more " @entity71 presents " would soon be coming			2
" unlike @entity119 , we do n't like giving all of our @entity71 presents out on one day			0
this entire month will be entertaining , " @entity120 tweeted			0
@entity2 's @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 contributed to this report .			0
