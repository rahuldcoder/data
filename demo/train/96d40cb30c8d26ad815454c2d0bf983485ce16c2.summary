-- an angry bunch of @entity2 has taken to the streets to protest government spending and the direction of the nation , and judging by the massive media coverage , it 's as if we have been invaded by a foreign entity , marching on state capitals and @entity12 ready to lead a coup d'Ã©tat against our elected officials			2
the rise of the @entity16 is being chronicled as a threat to democracy , or a grassroots collective unlike anything we have seen in many years			1
as @entity23 wisely put it with their hit song in 1988 , " do n't believe the hype ! " first , let 's deal with the @entity16 haters			1
how can any liberal , progressive , moderate or conservative be mad about a group of @entity2 taking to the streets to protest the actions of the country ? what they are engaged in is constitutional			2
the freedom to assemble , march , walk , scream and yell is right there in the document we all abide by			2
do i object to idiots holding up clearly racist signs , as well as the stupidity of images of president @entity43 as @entity44 ? of course			2
that ignorance detracts from whatever commentary they are trying to make on the status of the nation			2
when i debated @entity16 leader @entity50 on @entity0 's @entity51 360 show a few months ago , i was appalled when he was unwilling to say that if someone came to one of his rallies with a racist sign , he would tell them to take it down			1
he tried to invoke the @entity57 , but he was clearly offering people comfort for such shenanigans			2
but it 's clear that most of the folks attending @entity16 rallies are not bigots and homophobes			1
there are ignorant fools in all groups , and the @entity16 is no different			1
if anyone wants to oppose the @entity16 for spreading misinformation , do that			1
but to assert that it 's wrong to take part in civic engagement is utterly silly			2
the best of this country came out of the action of those in the streets			0
for those who oppose the @entity16 , you have every right to gather with those who agree with you and take to the streets			1
if they oppose the policies of president @entity43 , and you support them , demonstrate your support for his agenda			2
do n't whine about someone else making noise			0
men and women , stand up and be heard			0
and if you want to oppose the @entity16 , do so on the facts			1
it 's laughable when a @entity94 laments taxes in the @entity2 when , for the middle class , they are virtually at their lowest level in more than 50 years			1
to suggest that 95 percent of @entity2 did n't get a tax cut in president @entity43 's first year is just dead wrong			0
the reality is that the @entity16 is more aligned with @entity102			1
according to a @entity105 / @entity104 poll released last week , 18 percent of @entity2 say they view themselves as a member of the @entity16 ; 54 percent are @entity102 ; and 89 percent are white			1
sen. @entity107 received 59 million votes to @entity43 's 69 million votes			0
those 59 million voters did n't move to @entity111 or @entity112 , so they are predisposed to oppose the president 's agenda			0
so what we really have here is a group of people who are more likely than not to support @entity102 candidates nationwide			0
i do n't view the @entity16 as being some new entity that is drawing out disenfranchised voters who have long been absent from the process			1
they are no different in 2010 than what @entity125 was in 1998 : a group of disgruntled @entity2 operating outside of the traditional two - party apparatus and expressing their own self - interests			0
i more than welcome the @entity16 folks			1
protesting is @entity2 at its finest			0
but i 'm also not fooled one bit by them			0
they are a rowdy , loud and forceful bunch filled largely with republicans who oppose the policies of the president			0
there were a bunch of rowdy , loud and forceful liberals and progressives taking to the streets to oppose the policies of president @entity147			0
folks , this is n't a radical transformation of the nation shaping up			0
it 's the latest effort by citizens primarily in one party or professing one ideology to rise up and allow their voices to be heard			0
and that 's a good thing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			1

@entity16 supporters have protested against taxes , big government
@entity160 says their protests should be welcomed as expression of basic rights
he says @entity16 supporters should note taxes on middle class are at *historically* low levels
@entity160 : those who disagree with @entity16 should demonstrate to *air* their views
