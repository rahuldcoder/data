@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , one of the most famously secretive companies in the world , is giving the public a rare peek into how it makes and markets its products			1
two major @entity3 executives took the stand at the @entity3 patent trial against @entity13 friday in @entity0 , @entity1 , discussing the history of the @entity15 and @entity16 and the impact of @entity13 on the company			1
@entity3 is suing @entity13 for $ 2.5 billion , claiming it copied the design of the @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity13 is countersuing @entity3 for patent infringement and seeks a portion of all @entity15 and @entity16 profits			1
@entity24 , @entity3 's senior vice president of marketing , and @entity26 , senior vice president of @entity27 , both talked about how the @entity15 came to be , sharing some color about the device 's early days			1
the origin stories were meant to depict the @entity15 as an original , breakthrough technology and show that developing it was a risky undertaking for the company			1
addressing attorney behavior the day began with judge @entity34 taking the attorneys to task for recent behavior , including " messy " objections and possible jury tainting			0
earlier in the week , @entity13 released documents to the press that the court had already decided should not be seen by the jury			2
" i will not let any theatrics or any sideshow distract us from what we are here to do , " said judge @entity44 before asking each member of the jury if they had seen any of the press coverage of the case			0
one juror admitted to seeing headlines , but all said they could still be fair and impartial			0
judge @entity44 promised to print out and collate every article about the case to give to the jurors when the trial is over in exchange for their cooperation in avoiding the news until then			0
" we can scrapbook it for you , whatever you like , " she promised			0
remembering a secretive start @entity24 said the company was high on the success of the @entity72 in 2004 and trying to think of what to do next			0
executives threw out many ideas : " make a camera , make a car , crazy stuff			0
we were searching for what to do , " said @entity24			0
" we all had cell phones and we all hated our cell phones , " said @entity26 , who was in charge of the @entity15 's user interface and operating system			2
@entity3 was already experimenting with touchscreen tablet designs when top executives , including @entity87 , thought to use that technology and make a phone instead			1
the group began prototyping and a super-secret project was born			0
@entity87 split the work between separate groups : hardware , design and @entity26 's software group			0
@entity87 told @entity26 he could only hire existing @entity3 employees to work on the phone , dubbed the @entity99 , and employees were not told what they were working on or who it was for			1
a floor of one of @entity3 's @entity107 buildings was locked down tight , with security cameras and multiple badge readers			2
they called it the " @entity115 " and " @entity113 " motto was posted on the door			0
" the first rule of @entity99 is that you do not talk about it outside of those doors , " said @entity26			2
damage done @entity24 accused @entity13 of " ripping off " the @entity15 and @entity16 design , and said the imitations could confuse consumers and create problems for the @entity3 marketing team			1
when he first saw the @entity125 , @entity24 said he was shocked at how much it had copied @entity3 products			2
asked what he felt when the @entity129 came out , @entity24 said : " even more shock			0
my first thought was they 've done it again , they 're just going to copy our whole product line			0
" @entity3 spent more than $ 647 million marketing the @entity15 in the @entity137 , and $ 457 million on the @entity16 in the @entity137 it has spent money marketing the device in a number of ways , including billboards , magazines , bus shelters and product placement in movies and tv shows			1
according to @entity3 , a consumer could easily mistake the similar - looking @entity13 products for an @entity15 when briefly spotting it -- zipping by a billboard on a highway or in a 30 - second tv spot -- and could accidentally buy a the competing gadget			1
@entity3 and @entity13 products are sold at many of the same stores , including @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			1
@entity3 is not exactly hurting for sales			2
the financial success of @entity3 's @entity15 line is the stuff of @entity165 legend			1
@entity24 said there was even an internal joke that " each new generation sold was approximately equal to all the previous generations combined			0
" but part of that continued success is the halo effect -- customers buy their first product with a company and , when they have a positive experience , continue to buy related products and stick with the ecosystem			0
@entity24 said losing one customer who is confused and buys the wrong device is n't about the one smartphone or tablet			0
that could be a lost customer for years because they would be inclined to stick with whatever hardware and software ecosystem they started in			0
" i absolutely believe it 's had an impact on our sales , " @entity24 said			0
fighting over features a seemingly small feature developed and then patented by @entity26 's software group was the focus of much attention in the courtroom			0
the feature lets users double - tap on a web page to zoom in just to an exact area of text			0
an early selling point for the @entity15 was that it let you see the " whole web " instead of the bare - bones version of the @entity209 phones typically accessed at the time			1
this type of zooming was key to making the full sites usable on the @entity15 's screen			2
@entity24 was asked by @entity13 's council about the rounded corners on the @entity15 , and if they were chosen because they were necessary for the phone to easily fit into a user 's pocket			1
@entity13 has argued that @entity3 does not have a monopoly over the rectangle - with - rounded - corners design on smartphones			1
later in the day , @entity223 , @entity13 's chief strategy officer , testified that there are common industry reasons for phones to have rounded corners , including feeling more natural in the hand , fitting into pockets and withstanding drops better			2
much of the case hinges on @entity3 's claim that @entity13 imitated the design of @entity27 products , including those rounded corners			1
@entity24 read from internal @entity3 customer surveys that found a large percentage of customers cite design as a reason for choosing @entity3 devices			2
foreshadowing one of the more exciting e-mails put into evidence could show what 's to come next from @entity3			0
in january 2011 , @entity245 , @entity3 's senior vice president of internet services , forwarded @entity26 , @entity247 and @entity24 an article about switching from the @entity16 to @entity13 's @entity129 7 - inch tablet			1
" i believe there will be a 7 - inch market and we should do one , " said @entity245			1
@entity26 testified that @entity245 had used the @entity129 in the past , and it 's been widely rumored that @entity3 is working on a 7 - inch version of the @entity16 to be announced in september			1
while details about @entity3 's past products have been flowing , very little has emerged about any future gadgets the company may be working on			2
@entity13 's own counsel could n't resist trying to get secrets out of @entity24 , asking the executive if the design of the @entity262 would be changed from the @entity263			1
@entity24 declined to comment .			0
