@entity8 's oil spill response agency , @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , said in a statement that the ship has sustained " some damage from current movement and there is a significant amount of oil leaking from the vessel			1
" @entity11 estimates that 130 - 350 tonnes of oil have leaked from the vessel , which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters ( 450,000 gallons ) of fuel			1
the agency said that the vessel was still intact , but was being moved around by strong seas			2
clumps of oil from the leaking ship have been found on @entity25 beach in the @entity26			1

oil began leaking from the @entity30 , a @entity32 - flagged vessel , after it struck the @entity33 , about 12 nautical miles off the coast of @entity35 , on the @entity7 , on wednesday , creating a five - km ( three - mile ) slick			1
efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship , now heading south down the coast , are being hampered by high winds and strong swells			1
approximately 10 tonnes of fuel oil was transferred to tanks on board a barge before the recovery operation was suspended on monday			1
@entity11 said dispersants are being tested on the oil that has leaked			2
however , there are sea swells of up to four meters , which can make it difficult for the dispersant to work			0
worsening weather prompted the ship 's crew to be evacuated as a precautionary measure after a mayday call was made on tuesday			2
@entity58 architects and salvage experts on board the @entity30 are monitoring the vessel and have placed sensors to provide advance warning should the ship 's structure come under too much stress			1
@entity11 has established a one - kilometer maritime exclusion zone around the ship due to the health risk posed by the oil spill			2
national on - scene commander @entity71 said the operation to remove the oil from the ship , led by @entity75 , would be complex			2

@entity103 expressed " extreme concern " about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants			0
" this is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea , " the organization 's @entity108 said			0
" even a slow , and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched @entity8 's response capability to its limits			1
" it is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area , as well as numerous other marine species			0
" @entity8 prime minister @entity124 said two inquiries had been launched into the incident to discover how the ship hit the reef			1
" this is a very large ship , that in calm waters has hit an extremely well documented reef , " he told @entity99			0
