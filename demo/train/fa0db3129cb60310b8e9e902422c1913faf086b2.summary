-- eleven years ago this week , the world faced the outbreak of @entity3 , or @entity3 , a new epidemic that infected some 8,000 people , took the lives of 775 individuals , and inflicted $ 30 billion in damage to regional economies			1
the emergence of @entity3 was a wake - up call for the @entity12 and its members , including the @entity14			1
the world had to do more to prevent , detect and respond to new biological threats			2
this is not just a health challenge ; it 's a security challenge as well			1
infectious diseases -- whether naturally occurring , deliberate or accidental -- have the potential to cause enormous damage in terms of lives lost , economic impact and ability to recover , just as with nuclear , chemical , or cybersecurity attacks			1
during the anthrax attacks of 2001 , 22 people were infected and five people lost their lives here in in the @entity14			2
the cleanup cost was more than $ 1 billion			0
the global @entity35 influenza pandemic of 2009 killed 284,000 people worldwide in its first year alone , according to the @entity37			1
in the decade since the @entity3 outbreak , we have made notable progress			1
@entity42 , for instance , has shown leadership in its transparent approach to the ongoing and rapidly escalating @entity46 influenza outbreak			0
under revised @entity12 regulations , many countries have increased capability and made event reporting more transparent			0
but 80 % of the world 's nations still are not prepared to deal with new pandemics , and more can and must be done across the health , agriculture and security sectors to elevate this issue and steer resources toward it			2
the @entity14 has made addressing infectious disease threats a priority			2
on thursday in @entity63 and @entity64 , we are convening 26 countries to launch a @entity66 that will accelerate progress on addressing a wide range of global health security threats			1
with our partners and allies , we 'll be intensifying our efforts to meet the challenges of an increasingly globalized world , whether that means the emergence and spread of new microbes , the globalization of travel and food supply , the rise of drug - resistant pathogens , or the risk of an inadvertent or intentional release			0
at the same time , we 'll continue to work to prevent terrorists from developing , acquiring or using biological agents for harm			0
new diseases are inevitable , but in the 21st century we have the tools to greatly reduce the threat posed by global epidemics			2
we can put in place a safe , secure , globally linked , inter-operable system to prevent disease threats , detect outbreaks in real time , and share information and expertise to respond effectively			0
to achieve this goal , we must work more effectively across sectors and governments , harmonize our efforts , identify what works and measure our progress			0
we invite national leaders , international organizations and nongovernmental stakeholders from around the world to join us in this endeavor			0
our security and the lives and livelihoods of our citizens depend on it			0
