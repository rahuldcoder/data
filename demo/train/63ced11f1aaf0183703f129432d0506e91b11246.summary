@entity0 , @entity1 -- a long - running conflict between the @entity1 government and the @entity5 over old corruption cases against president @entity7 appeared to move close to a resolution wednesday as the two sides reached agreement on a crucial letter			1
but the accord left open the question of whether @entity7 will ever have to stand trial over the cases			0
after three years of quarreling , the @entity5 approved a draft of a letter from the @entity1 government to the @entity21 authorities about the corruption cases , said @entity24 minister @entity23 after meeting with the judges			1
the cases relate to money - laundering charges from the 1990s against @entity7 and his late wife , former prime minister @entity28			1
