, there 's more to look forward to in season 4			1
we 'll also meet his recurring character , the firm 's appointed trustee @entity15 , in the season premiere			1
" he becomes a foil to everyone , but primarily @entity21 and @entity22 , " co-creator @entity20 says			1
" we 've been studying a lot about law firm bankruptcies , and when you want to restructure to give yourself relief from your creditors , sometimes a bank or court will order in a trustee			1
a trustee is someone who represents the creditors ' interest , and he or she is brought in above the managers , or the partners in this case			1
he basically can veto any decisions of the partners			1
" it 's an especially interesting time for @entity22 , who 'll be practicing again now that his suspension is over			1
" because they are in this kind of bankruptcy limbo where they have to make a certain amount to pay off the creditors in a certain amount of time , it 's a very bad time to find a conscience			1
just like we 're all struggling with that in this economy : how much do you let your ethics lead , and how much do you let your pragmatism lead ? will 's gon na be struggling with that almost daily			2
" and do n't forget about @entity58			2
" @entity58 's someone who has new clout given this bankruptcy and the fact that family law is doing so well			2
given the world of @entity65 and how much it 's struggling , @entity58 is a commodity and will have a lot of confrontations with the @entity13 character			1
we felt we painted ourselves a little into a corner having him over at the @entity74 's office			2
it really was good for cases when he was on the other side , and it was really good with the @entity80 relationship			1
we got to see what that developed into			2
but we feel so much better having him again in - house , " @entity20 admits			2
" you just want to see more of him			2
you want to see more contact with @entity88 , with @entity5			2
so we feel we have a mature @entity89 coming back to the @entity65 fold			1
the irony , of course , is the moment he comes back is when things are just miserable financially over there			2
so it 's both good and bad for him			2
@entity89 started as someone who was more pragmatic and then become more ethical over the last three years			1
we want to see how that plays out now in this new environment where it 's kind of dog eat dog			2
" and how will things be between @entity89 and @entity5 ? " there 's a difficulty there , because now @entity5 's husband 's in town , and so , the @entity89 - @entity5 relationship is n't a straight line			1
it never has been , but it gets even more crooked , " @entity20 says			2
" and i think the other thing with @entity89 is we want to see a little bit more of people 's home lives this year			1
it 's hard for the show to go too far in that direction , because it ca n't take you too far from other plot lines			2
" @entity121 's focused again on @entity80			1
" we felt we made a mistake with @entity121 last year			0
sorry to admit it now , " @entity20 says , with a laugh			0
" but the thing is , @entity121 seems to have more fun when he has one overwhelming goal for the year , as opposed to little goals			0
and the goal for the year is to get @entity80 elected governor			1
and @entity121 has never played in the big leagues like this before			0
and to see an @entity121 , who is unhinged , try to get @entity80 elected is just going to be very fun i think both for @entity134 and the audience , who will see him dealing with a lot that we see now nationally with @entity138 and @entity139 — the mix of serious issues but also being tainted by frivolous issues			1
how do you separate the two and should you ? how do you keep what 's frivolous in the public 's eye so they do n't start questioning about @entity80 's past with a prostitute or @entity80 's time in prison ? it 's not just a defensive game , it 's an offensive game , and @entity121 becomes a master at that game			1
" @entity157 and @entity121 ! " you 're gon na see @entity157 first in episode 4 , and she 's gon na have a stronger presence this year , partly because @entity157 is someone who will use anything to get what she wants , and now she 's using her potential illness as another weapon in her arsenal			0
the other thing is for the campaign , it 's very important when you 're going state - wide in @entity167 that you get the senior vote			0
and @entity157 can pull in seniors who would otherwise be reluctant to vote for someone who slept with prostitutes , " @entity20 says			0
" so obviously , what we love about that is her fights with @entity121			0
so @entity134 and @entity175 are for us a couple from comedy heaven			0
we want to see more of those struggles as they go through the campaign this year			0
" a different kind of @entity80			1
" the third season was a @entity80 who wanted to do things differently			1
this year is a @entity80 who really wants to win , and how do you keep your ethics when you really want to win ? do you just let other people around you do the dirty work for you , or do you engage on that ? " @entity20 says			1
" some of the issues from the year before will come back for him , supposed racism in his department and other issues			0
so what we want to see a @entity80 who has to deal with these things sometimes by ignoring them and letting @entity121 just handle them			1
" how @entity80 's campaign affects @entity88			1
" there 's a more engaged @entity88 this year because she really wants her husband to win , too			1
not for any power move on her part , but because she 's afraid of what the opposition will bring , " @entity20 says			0
let 's start with the kids : " @entity209 's 17 , @entity208 is 15			0
@entity209 really wants to be involved with the campaign			0
@entity88 does n't want it			0
but at a certain point , the kids reach the age where they 're not off - limits anymore			0
how do you keep them from being involved with the campaign when they 're kind of being dragged into the campaign by the press ? " @entity20 says			0
" and what we like about that is what it does for @entity88			0
her natural instinct has always been to protect her kids , but then it becomes a question mark : is it really appropriate anymore to protect them as much as she wants to ? " as the issue of race becomes part of the campaign , the fact that @entity209 is dating an @entity232 young woman could be useful			0
" the difficulty obviously is where does @entity88 draw the line when she knowingly is being used : do you just start having a jaundiced eye toward the fact , or do you really draw the line and say , ' i will not allow our family to be used this way ? ' and that 's a struggle within @entity88 because she 's not a kid anymore and she 's not naive about how the world works			0
" there 's also @entity88 's friendship with @entity254 's recurring character , wealthy businesswoman @entity255 , who makes her first appearance in the second episode			1
@entity121 will want @entity255 to endorse @entity80			1
" the difficulty dramatically for characters on our show is where do you draw a line between the personal and the professional			0
and sometimes , more often than not , people do n't draw the line			0
everything that 's professional is personal and everything that 's personal is professional			0
and for @entity88 , that 's a very difficult balance			0
sometimes she wants someone to be a friend and not there to be an agenda			0
