-- as has frequently been the case in the last two - and - a - half years , i found myself this past weekend caught in an intense conversation about the ongoing civil war in @entity5			1
this time it was with a supporter of the @entity9 government			0
he was relentless , insisting that there was no choice but victory , at any cost , especially since the government has been facing foreign fighters from " 83 countries			0
" it 's a common refrain i 've heard in different variations from all sides of the conflict -- there is no choice but victory			2
as the world debates the efficacy of a military strike against the @entity9 government in response to its use of chemical weapons on civilians , the fighting on the ground shows no signs of abating			2
it is clear that the @entity5 people are caught between a zero - sum political game being played by the regime and rebels , and their respective backers			1
despite lofty rhetoric from a number of countries , diplomatic efforts towards a political solution could have been more vigorous			0
opinion : @entity5 a distraction from real @entity49 challenges calling for an immediate cease - fire on all sides is the only path towards peace			1
but will the @entity49 and other key players go down that road ? the @entity5 uprising began in march 2011 , partly in response to the imprisonment and brutal treatment of teenagers in the southern city of @entity62 , who had tagged some buildings with anti-government graffiti			2
initially , the protesters avoided mentioning dictator @entity67 by name			0
but the demonstrations quickly intensified in the face of continued government crackdowns			0
by august of the same year , over 2,000 @entity5 had been killed and the security apparatus of the regime was out in full force , attempting to crush any dissent , peaceful or otherwise through the dastardliest of means			1
it was no surprise then that the standoff turned violent , as ragtag militias formed to contest government forces			0
soon , there was an influx of weapons from neighboring @entity84 and distant @entity85 , as well as foreign reinforcements on the side of the fragmented rebel fighters			0
by the spring of 2012 , the conflict had clearly transformed into a civil war			0
since then , the violence has only escalated and the death toll climbed , as the battles have moved from city to city across the country			0
entire neighborhoods in @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and elsewhere have been destroyed to rubble			0
four questions for backers of @entity5 mission the @entity9 government ultimately bears responsibility for the conflict and most of the deaths			1
however , both sides have committed crimes against humanity			0
with over 100,000 @entity5 dead and millions more displaced internally or as refugees in neighboring countries , the @entity49 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and others have mostly looked on			2
instead of bringing the contesting forces to the table to force them to a solution , the @entity49 and @entity113 and their regional allies continue to send money and arms into the conflict			2
when was the last time president @entity126 called for an immediate cease - fire ? when was the last time that the @entity49 and @entity113 said simply and with integrity : stop the violence			1
opinion : a @entity49 strike would be self - wounding this call has been missing for fear it could undermine the rebels ( or for @entity113 , the regime )			1
nowhere was this more apparent than in the battle for @entity140 , which unfolded in front of the world 's eyes earlier in the summer , with @entity146 forces buttressing the @entity9 regime on one side and foreign fighters helping the opposition on the other side			2
the @entity153 envoys , including @entity154 and @entity155 , have tried to facilitate talks , but with little result , mostly because they were sent to @entity5 with their hands tied behind their back			1
without the political backing from the permanent members of the @entity164 , what authority could their initiatives have ? we can not give up on the political process and negotiations , even if the @entity49 carries out a military strike , even if there are countless bombings in coming weeks , and even if we can only achieve a brief reprieve from the violence			0
opinion : on @entity5 , @entity126 must show strong grip we need to revisit the @entity176 discussions , which began in 2012 and outlined roughly a " transition plan			1
" there 's also the oft - touted @entity176 2 meeting -- which has yet to be scheduled -- where a future power - sharing agreement in @entity5 would be discussed			1
the @entity176 2 meeting would bring together key constituents , including the rebels and the regime			1
while this process , held under the auspices of the @entity153 , is far from perfect and may well be a long shot , it offers the best chance towards a political solution to the @entity5 conflict			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity193 : the world is debating whether military action in @entity5 makes sense
@entity193 : calling for an immediate cease - fire on all sides is the only path to peace
he says the @entity176 2 meeting would bring together the rebels and the regime for talks
@entity193 : the best chance for a solution to the @entity5 conflict is through negotiations
