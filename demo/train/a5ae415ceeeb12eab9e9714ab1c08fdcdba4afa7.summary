i got an urgent call from the doctor			2
come to my office immediately , he said			2
the test results have arrived			2
a few days earlier , i suddenly felt so ill that i asked the doctor to test for everything and find out why i had been feeling this way			1
two months prior , my new husband and i returned from our honeymoon in the @entity12			1
he became severely ill on the 11 - hour flight home			2
his headache and high fever lasted for days but then went away before his doctor could determine the cause			2
and now i felt horrible			2
nothing in life prepared me for the test results			0
had the doctor said " you have diabetes , " that would have made sense			0
my mother and grandfather had diabetes			0
but when he said " you have @entity31 , " it blew my mind ! and it made no sense , no sense at all			1
in the next breath the doctor said " your husband needs a test " and " you need to contact everyone you 've had sex with to tell them you have @entity31 , they all need to get tested			1
" " fortunately for you , " he said , " i have expertise in this area			0
" he sent me to his office 's social worker who asked if my husband would become violent with news of the diagnosis			1
she filled the rest of our time together trying to connect with me , sharing stories of her excessive drinking habits , as if i could relate			0
i called my husband and asked him to meet me at home			1
i broke the news to him about the diagnosis and got him tested			0
my new husband also tested positive for @entity31			1
the doctor told us that i had the disease for a long time and did not prescribe me any medication			0
he also said i gave my husband the virus so he prescribed antiretroviral drugs for him			1
how could this happen ? was this a death sentence ? how long did we have to live ? what did we need to do ? and oh my @entity70 ! the doctor says i 'd given my new husband a disease of the " wicked and amoral			1
" without any question , he and his staff decided i was a whore and / or addict			0
this was stunning ! i was a wreck			1
it was only later that i discovered e-mails that proved my husband had been living life on the " down low " -- secretly having unprotected sex with many men -- and had likely given me the disease			1
that was 2000 , more than 10 years ago			2
in fact , i thrive			0
looking back , i realized i was very fortunate			0
several weeks after the diagnosis , i was referred to a therapist who really was an expert in hiv / aids			1
he was my sole support in navigating the strange and disturbing world of @entity31			1
my therapist 's first task was supporting me in finding a medical doctor with @entity88 infectious disease credentials			2
fortunately , i had the financial resources to pay for therapy as my life slowly and painfully unraveled			0
for me , my therapist showed me why mental health care was as important in treating @entity31 as a knowledgeable , supportive medical doctor			1
but most others are n't so fortunate			0
fear of judgment and discrimination force people diagnosed with @entity31 or @entity88 to live in isolation			1
lack of money and access to support services prevent them from getting the emotional help required to cope in a life - affirming way			2
with the stigma of getting @entity88 , coupled with the myth that life is over , i felt like the entire system was telling me to go into the corner and die			0
but it does n't have to be that way			0
for women like me -- heterosexual , vibrant , who may have contracted @entity31 through their male partner -- there needs to be more resources available to help us deal with the mental landmines that this situation creates			1
too many people in our society are grossly uninformed and still cling to misguided beliefs about hiv / aids			1
consequently , the lack of accurate information about @entity88 increases the risk of transmission and decreases the likelihood for women to escape the downward spiral			0
at first , as a working professional and career engineer , i was fortunate to have access and the ability to pay for extensive mental health care			1
but tending to this crisis eventually cost me my career , and then the money ran out			2
it was n't until i was the subject of a segment on the " @entity151 " in september 2010 that my struggle started to gain more meaning			0
i found there were many more women out there like me			2
according to @entity157 , a professor of psychology and neuroscience at @entity160 , " persons living with hiv / aids have disproportionately high rates of psychiatric disorders , with mood and anxiety disorders being the most common			1
ca n't go to sleep			0
ca n't get out of bed			0
these were all foreign concepts to me until i was diagnosed			0
i had little background in dealing with mental illness , @entity31 and even less experience in how to get help			1
so i launched the @entity176			0
" @entity176 " was my @entity178 alias used during a lengthy court battle with my former husband , a battle that went all the way to the @entity183 and resulted in a $ 12.5 million negligence and fraud judgment against him			2
and no , i have yet to see a penny from him			0
the new foundation is dedicated to providing access to mental and other health services for @entity193 women with @entity31 while respecting their need for privacy			1
we have a lot of work to do			0
@entity31 is deadly serious , but it does n't have to be a death sentence			1
however , without access to mental health services to help women cope with the inevitable struggles , too often it is			1
today , i am doing well			0
the loves of my life -- my daughter , her father ( both @entity31 negative ) -- and i are living each day to its fullest			1
and we know tomorrow will be even better			0

@entity212 : in 2000 , i found out i have @entity31 , and that my new husband has it , too
@entity215 : i was a wreck , i asked : how could this happen ? was this a death sentence ?
she says luckily she found a therapist who helped her navigate her through the crisis
@entity215 : for those who live with hiv / aids , access to mental health care is *critical*
