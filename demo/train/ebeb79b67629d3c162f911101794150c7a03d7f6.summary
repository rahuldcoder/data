-- sometime around the mid- 1990s , the reality show was born			2
since then , the genre has taken the world by storm : audiences continue to love these shows and they cost next to nothing to make ( cheap video , cheap sets , amateur " actors , " etc. )			1
so the profit margins are huge			0
if you 're a producer , what 's not to like ? of course , there are few who would have much positive to say about the artistic values involved			2
still , we seem to find reality riveting			2
until it comes to @entity21 's space program			1
here , general audiences greatly prefer fiction			1
the much - anticipated film " gravity , " for example , opened in the @entity21 this past weekend to rave reviews and a record - breaking box office take of $ 55.8 million			1
ask anyone on the street , and chances are they are aware of the film , or at least have heard something about it			0
5 things that could n't happen in ' gravity ' then consider : two weeks ago , a @entity38 rocket launched the next astronaut crew to the @entity40 and there was barely a collective yawn , because practically nobody in the general population knew or cared ! why do general audiences love " @entity48 , " " @entity49 , " and other science fiction films , but do n't seem to care about what is going on in real space exploration ? here is my take on it : 1			1
we 've made it look easy for so long that the only time people pay attention is when there is an emergency or an accident			2
people got used to everything going well			2
that 's boring to them			0
i have to admit that i ca n't sit through films of myself doing spacewalks			0
we did n't mess anything up , or go floating off into space to a slow terrifying death , so where 's the excitement ? 2			2
reality space exploration is done by professionals			1
the back and forth between astronauts and mission control is intentionally succinct and to the point , with no unnecessary emotion			0
better to watch an exciting reality tv show with name calling , hair pulling and other tantrums ! who knows what will happen next ? 3			0
reality space hardware does n't look cool enough			1
i was training for my third space mission when @entity88 and crew came to @entity90 to film parts of " @entity92			1
" later , i had a chance to visit a set in @entity95 during additional filming			0
i have to say that their fake space suits , spacecraft and other hardware looked very cool indeed , much more cool than the reality stuff i was going to use ! 4			1
the physics of reality spaceflight are also boring			1
orbital mechanics can be quite complex			0
maneuvers and orbit changes are performed precisely and deliberately , and take some time			0
much more exciting to have spacecraft " fly " like winged jet fighters in space , like in " @entity48			0
" how boring would those battle scenes have been had their maneuvers been technically accurate ? what @entity112 thinks of ' gravity ' nonetheless , the actual experience of spaceflight trumps all movie cool			1
there is nothing like working hard in a space suit helping assemble a space station , while every now and then stealing glimpses of the surreal view of continents and oceans rolling by below			1
there is nothing like riding a rocket to orbit , or watching the plasma glow envelop your spacecraft during entry , as bits of burning heat shield go flying past the porthole			0
there 's nothing like approaching a space station and actually flying the spacecraft to a docking			1
i 'll take reality space any day			1
now , having said all that , i have watched " gravity			0
" ignoring technical inaccuracies , i enjoyed it			0
and i am newly grateful that @entity90 had no such technical inaccuracies during my flights			0
watch for my review ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			2

@entity152 : @entity21 love reality shows . when it comes to space program , prefer fiction
he says " gravity " well known , but do people care a crew just rocketed to space station ?
he says we 're inured to space flight , movies make it look , sound cooler , less *workaday*
@entity152 : truth is , space travel trumps all movie cool . spaceflight surreal , *thrilling*
