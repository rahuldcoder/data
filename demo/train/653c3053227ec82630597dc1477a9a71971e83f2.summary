@entity0 -- chancellor @entity3 's popularity will not be enough to ensure a continuation of the government she would like to lead after @entity6 go to the polls - and a newcomer on the political scene could throw a wrench in the gears of her plans for the nation			1
despite standing 20 points higher in the ratings than challenger @entity18 of the @entity19 , @entity3 's conservative @entity14 ( @entity15 ) are unlikely to secure enough votes for an absolute majority			1
it is actually the chancellor 's own camp in the political spectrum of the right that threatens the current government , made up of the @entity14 and their junior partner , the liberal democratic @entity29			2
the upstart @entity31 ( @entity31 ) party could deliver payback to @entity34 's paymaster , because of chancellor @entity3 's ad hoc reactions to financial instability in the @entity38			1
with a populist platform cloaked in its profile as the " party of professors , " the nascent @entity31 touts an anti-euro platform , and is channelling supporters away from the right and enticing protest voters			2
together , they could be enough to help the @entity31 garner the five per cent of the vote they need to gain seats in @entity6 's parliament , the @entity51			1
the party currently scores between 2 % and 4 % in the polls			0

just as suddenly as the @entity31 party appeared on the scene earlier this year , consensus on @entity6 's role in @entity34 may disintegrate in @entity0 , since there is now a conservative political voice breaking the taboo on questioning @entity6 's integration within the @entity68			1
neither the political parties nor the @entity6 electorate has mobilized around any burning issues this campaign season , but the @entity31 has tapped into an undercurrent of frustration about the euro and unease about @entity6 's economic resilience			2
@entity3 has steered @entity34 's biggest economy well during the global economic crisis : today , unemployment is under 7 % and @entity6 's export engine is the envy of many countries			2
two decades after reunification , the nation seems to have reached the zenith in economic indicators , but looming in the background are structural factors such as a demographic decline and income disparity which , coupled with aiding @entity38 countries in the periphery , creates unease among this nation of savers			0
according to the 2013 @entity97 , a majority of @entity6 would like to see each @entity68 member state maintain authority over its own economic and budgetary policies			0

as a result , there is ample recruiting ground for parties like the @entity31 to generate a critical mass. even if it does n't enter the @entity51 this time around , its mere existence could create more political fragmentation and upend @entity3 's current center - right coalition			1
just as election campaigning swung into gear at the end of the summer , finance minister @entity118 predicted another bailout for @entity123			0
this was the moment for @entity3 to outline a plan for the @entity34 project in order to neutralize the opposition complaining about her lack of a plan and calm the euroskeptics in her midst , reinforcing her credibility as a measured leader in times of crisis			0
instead she is riding on @entity6 ' current sense of prosperity to usher in a third term as chancellor			0
but as long as the @entity31 remains a potential player in @entity0 , @entity6 will always be reminded of the solidity of the @entity146 , and @entity3 may soon see the conservatives splinter , just as the @entity6 left has done over the past decade			1
