-- in its halcyon days , the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity1 boasted of going the extra mile to make guests " feel privileged			0
" it sent flowers and cooled towels to their rooms , and made porsches and @entity11 -- even helicopters -- available at a moment 's notice			1
but by early wednesday , the remaining guests at the luxury hotel in the @entity1 capital were reduced to raiding cabinets for cheese and fruit			2
about 35 journalists who were allowed into the @entity23 country to cover the conflict with the blessing of the @entity27 regime are trapped at the hotel for a fifth day			1
and about five more journalists covering clashes in the area fled into the hotel wednesday morning and were briefly barred from leaving , said @entity0 's @entity33 , who is among those at the hotel			1
four were later allowed to go , she saw			0
but armed @entity27 loyalists ring the hotel 's perimeter and patrol its corridors , barring most journalists there from leaving			1
it 's for their protection , the guards say			2
@entity0 's @entity45 , who is also at the hotel , urged other journalists in the city not to come for fear they , too , would be trapped			1
" we are not being allowed to leave			0
we are obviously in a very fragile position , " he said			0
they have enough snack food and bottled water to last for several days , he explained			0
" after that , we 're going to be in trouble , " he added			0
so , as battle rages outside for control of @entity3 between pro-regime and rebel forces , the reporters can do little but sit and wait			0
with no air - conditioning and sporadic electricity , they walk the halls with the glow of candlelight to guide them			0
giant paintings of @entity1 leader @entity27 stare down at them from hotel walls			1
snipers keep a wary eye from rooftops			0
" the concern we have now is that we seem to be in one of the few remaining patches of territory in @entity1 which is still controlled by @entity27 's forces , " chance said			1
" and so we 're kind of very anxious about what might happen at this hotel in the hours ahead			2
" the reporters spend their days in helmets and bullet proof vests			0
at night , they sleep on bedsheets in the hallway to avoid shards of glass from windows shattered by gunfire			1
" this is not a comfortable position , but ... all in good spirits , " @entity91 correspondent @entity90 tweeted tuesday			0
chance said the journalists would like to " negotiate an exit , " but have been prevented from doing so			2
the reporters have put up white bed sheets from the top floor balconies of the hotel			2
in large black letters , they scrawled the words " tv , press , do n't shoot " on them to leave no doubt they are impartial observers in the conflict			0
" @entity27 loyalists have basically regarded the international media as being on the rebels ' side in this conflict , even though that 's obviously not the case , " chance said			1
" we 're just here trying to report the government 's side of things in this conflict			2
" the hotel has served as a de facto media hub approved by the regime for international journalists and scores of government officials who relocated their families there during the civil war			1
it also made headlines along the way			0
in march , @entity133 , stormed the hotel in tears while journalists were having breakfast and said @entity27 forces had raped her			1
in may , @entity27 himself made an unannounced appearance to hold a meeting with tribal leaders			1
his sudden appearance , and the fact that the hotel is now being guarded so closely , has led to some speculation that @entity27 himself is there , or that he has access to the hotel through secret tunnels from his bunker			1
but @entity45 said he and other journalists had " scoured " the hotel " from top to bottom " and had seen no evidence of tunnels			1
on tuesday , @entity27 's son , @entity159 , turned up to debunk reports that rebels had captured him			1
hours after the son 's defiance stance , rebel fighters and throngs of citizens stormed the ruler 's fortress compound in @entity169 not far away			2
celebratory gunfire rang out as residents took off with souvenirs , including reams of documents and weapons			2
but away from the action , the journalists waited as dawn gave way to another day wednesday -- and more clashes erupted outside the hotel			1
chance said their goal is to avoid agitating the guards			2
" we do not want to prompt any dangerous action , " he said			0
" we are trying to stay as safe as possible			0
" he hopes the nightmare , as he called it , ends soon			0
" in a fizzle , " he said			0
