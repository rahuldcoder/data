@entity0 -- the planned large rally by @entity3 and radio talk show host @entity4 on saturday on the @entity6 is causing controversy because of its location and timing			1
saturday is the 47th anniversary of the rev. @entity12 's " @entity13 " speech , and @entity4 's rally will be in front of the @entity16 , where the civil rights leader delivered his historic address			1
@entity4 , a hero to many conservative voters across the country , says that the mission of the rally is to honor @entity24 troops and that the event is nonpolitical			1
a news release for the " @entity28 " rally says " this non-political event benefits the @entity30 and pays tribute to @entity24 's service personnel and other upstanding citizens who embody our nation 's founding principles of integrity , truth and honor			1
" @entity41 activists from across the country are expected to attend , and former @entity43 gov. @entity42 , a @entity3 contributor , is expected to have a prominent speaking role			0
" @entity47 , our national coordinators , are going because our supporters from around the country by the thousands are going to be there tomorrow for this event , " @entity47 national coordinator @entity46 said friday on " @entity1 's @entity48			2
" @entity4 has been heavily promoting the event on his @entity3 program and on his radio broadcasts , and he says that the timing of the event was n't intentional			1
" it was not my intention to select 8 - 28 because of the @entity12 tie			0
it is the day he made that speech			2
i had no idea until i announced it , " @entity4 said on his radio show in june , soon after the announcement of the rally			1
" whites do n't own @entity71			2
blacks do n't own @entity12			2
those are @entity24 icons , @entity24 ideas , and we should just talk about character , and that 's really what this event is about			1
it 's about honoring character , " @entity4 said thursday on his @entity3 program			1
also speaking at the event will be @entity84 , a niece of the late civil rights leader			1
while the @entity88 put out a cautious statement regarding the rally , there has been plenty of criticism of the event			2
" it 's offensive because it 's out of line with the fact			0
it 's out of line with the truth			0
the reality is that the conservative movement in @entity24 historically has always opposed expansion of civil rights for all kinds of people , " @entity100 , an assistant professor of public policy at @entity102 , said friday on @entity1 's @entity48			1
" from my perspective , there 's no real evidence that @entity4 is serious about trying to bring people together and to reclaim the civil rights movement , in my opinion ; it 's really about trying to confuse the civil rights movement and to delegitimize it and in fact dishonor it , " @entity100 said			1
expect a lot of debate over the size of the crowd			0
while the @entity123 long ago stopped giving crowd estimates for events along the @entity6 , organizers of the rally are putting out predictions			0
@entity127 , director of state and federal campaigns for @entity130 , which has been helping to organize the event , predicts a crowd of 250,000 or more			0
he thinks the crowd will fill up the @entity16 area , the reflecting pool and reach the area by the @entity137			0
@entity130 is a nonprofit organization that helps train volunteer activists and provides some of the organization behind the @entity41 movement , including last year 's 9/12 taxpayer march on @entity0			2
" @entity130 has been sharing our logistical notes from organizing the huge @entity144 in 2009 with @entity4 's staff , " @entity127 said			1
" they are doing the heavy lifting on the 8/28 event , and we 've tried to be as supportive as possible in terms of promotion , sending volunteers their way , helping them navigate the bureaucratic obstacles to doing events in @entity0 , and most importantly , turning out @entity130 members for the weekend 's events			2
" one hour after the start of the @entity4 rally , @entity88 president and ceo @entity157 will join the rev. @entity161 and his @entity162 and other civil rights leaders in a mass rally just a few miles away			1
education secretary @entity165 is also participating			0
following an event at @entity0 's @entity168 , the participants will march to the site of the future @entity170 just a few blocks from the @entity16			2
it 's possible participants in both events could cross paths			0
organizers of the @entity4 rally and @entity130 say they have not coordinated their efforts with @entity179 officials			1
and officials at the @entity181 , the @entity182 and the @entity183 all say they are not involved in the event			0
but a top @entity186 @entity185 charges that @entity4 's claim that the rally is nonpolitical is nonsense			1
" it 's blatantly political , " rep. @entity189 of @entity190 , the chairman of the @entity191 , said at an appearance friday at the @entity193			0
" i mean , come on			0
you have seen @entity4 and a lot of the talk show hosts on @entity3 out there talking about this election for the last 15 months since the day president @entity200 was elected president			1
" " you 've had a constant tirade against the president , against @entity191 efforts to get the economy turned around			0
let 's call it what it is			0
it 's a blatant political effort			0

@entity4 's " *restoring* honor " rally will be on same day , near spot of " @entity13 " speech
@entity4 says timing is n't deliberate , his event is nonpolitical and it aims to honor @entity24 troops
critics say event dishonors civil rights movement
the rev. @entity161 , other civil rights leaders plan mass rally just a few miles away
