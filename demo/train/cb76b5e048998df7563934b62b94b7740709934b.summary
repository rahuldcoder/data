-- for weeks , @entity2 officials said that more than 200 @entity2 school girls would finally be freed			1
when it fell apart , there was nothing but devastation			0
over and over , sources told @entity0 's @entity9 that negotiations between the government and @entity12 , the group that snatched the girls in april , were getting somewhere			1
the journalist was assured that the @entity16 terror group had agreed to a cease - fire , and as part of that deal , the girls would be able to return to their families			1
for once , @entity9 allowed herself to feel optimistic			1
a native of @entity24 , the journalist was personally drawn to the tragedy that inspired the global campaign " bring back our girls			1
" " those girls were poor , from a remote part of @entity2 , " in @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity9 said			1
the area has been long ignored , and the people there have gotten by on very little , she said			0
the girls were kidnapped while they were at school			1
" they were just trying to get an education , " @entity9 said			2
" but for the grace of @entity40 , i come from an educated family and my life has been different			0
it 's the power of education that has allowed me to become a @entity0 anchor			1
these girls were in school to change their circumstances			2
" @entity9 got on a plane to @entity2 days ago as sources told her that the girls ' freedom was imminent			1
when she landed she started to hear more from journalists who have extensively covered @entity12 , and from those who knew how the terror group operated			1
they were suspicious , and doubted that the government was really in talks with the terrorists			0
there were other red flags			0
no one from @entity12 said anything about the supposed cease - fire			2
in fact , members remained active in northeastern @entity2 , and actually carried out more attacks and child abductions			2
@entity9 and her @entity0 crew kept hoping			1
maybe it was simple banditry in the north , she reasoned			0
it was hard to bear the idea that the girls would n't be freed			2
" we wanted to believe , " she said			0
" we gave ( @entity2 officials ) the benefit of the doubt , i suppose			2
" a crushing video on november 1 , a video appeared of @entity12 leader , @entity81 saying no cease - fire been reached			1
the girls were not going to be released , he said , laughing			0
they had converted to @entity85 and were married off			0
" they are , " he said , " in the marital homes			0
" it was a crushing blow			1
" it was like he was saying , ' this is done , ' " @entity9 recalled			2
after the video was released , @entity2 's government asserted that negotiations had happened , and @entity81 had gone back on promises he 'd made during those talks			1
" we 've heard about the video , and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you can not expect otherwise , " a spokesman said			0
" @entity2 has been fighting a war , and wars do n't end overnight			2
" in late october , @entity106 released a report on @entity12 violence against women and girls in @entity2			1
the group interviewed kidnap victims including a dozen of the @entity31 girls who escaped			2
the girls had been imprisoned in eight @entity12 camps in the @entity117 , the report said			1
the women and girls who refused to convert to @entity85 were physically and sexually assaulted , @entity106 said , and some were forced to marry their captors			0
men and boys who were abducted , the report says , were given the choice of joining the group or being murdered			0
what gives @entity12 its strength ? ' how could they do this ? ' before she left @entity2 , @entity9 called @entity130 , a former @entity2 government official and one of the leaders of the @entity134 campaign			1
" she sounded sick with grief when she answered the phone , " @entity9 recalled			0
" i said ... ' are you ok ? ' which is ... so stupid			0
she was just -- her voice was hoarse with pain			0
she said , ' how could they do this ? ' " @entity130 said she was n't sure if the parents of the girls would recover			0
@entity9 said she is committed to continue to tell the girls ' stories			1
each deserves to live out their unique passions and paths			0
" we have to keep asking questions , " she said			0
" we have set expectations low in terms of getting meaningful answers			0
" @entity12 -- the essence of terror			1

@entity0 's @entity9 is personally driven to continue to tell the story of kidnapped @entity2 school girls
she went to @entity164 because sources told her that terror group @entity12 would release the girls
@entity12 's leader said that the girls would not be freed , but had been married off
the turn of events felt like a crushing blow to so many who have fought for the girls to return home
