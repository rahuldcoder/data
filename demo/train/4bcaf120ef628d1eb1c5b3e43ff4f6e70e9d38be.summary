-- six job recruiters have been indicted in federal court in what the @entity3 has called the largest human - trafficking operation ever to result in charges in the @entity7			2
an indictment unsealed in @entity9 on thursday accuses employees of a @entity12 - based company of luring about 400 people from @entity14 with false promises of lucrative jobs			1
many of the imported workers wound up laboring on farms under substandard conditions , had their passports confiscated , and were threatened with deportation			0
in one instance , several @entity14 workers allegedly were detained at a pineapple farm on @entity26 and told to pay an additional fee of $ 3,750 to keep their jobs			1
those who refused were sent back to @entity14 with unpaid debts			1
" the object of the conspiracy was to obtain cheap , compliant labor , " said the indictment , " indebted by the defendants ' recruitment fees , and to compel the workers ' labor and service through threats to have the workers arrested , deported , or sent back to @entity14			1
" the workers were brought to the @entity7 under the federal h2 - a visa program , which places foreign workers on @entity7 farms			2
the case was investigated by the @entity47 's @entity46 and the @entity3 in @entity48 , where many of the guest workers wound up			0
four of those charged worked for labor recruiting firm @entity51 , based in @entity53 , @entity12			1
two @entity14 - based recruiters also were charged			1
the operation allegedly began in may 2004			0
@entity57 president and ceo @entity56 , 45 , an @entity59 national , was accused of leading the conspiracy			0
his attorney , @entity61 , did not return a message seeking comment			0
a call to the company was not answered			2
@entity3 agents went to @entity56 's home with an arrest warrant friday morning , but he was not at home , said special agent @entity70 in @entity48 , @entity9			1
he said agents have been in touch with @entity56 by telephone and are attempting to negotiate his surrender to authorities			0
attorneys for the @entity14 laborers said many of them initially were taken to farms in @entity9 and @entity80 , where the working and living conditions were often deplorable			1
other sites included @entity12 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
several guest workers alleged one of the defendants , @entity94 , promised them pay of $ 8.72 per hour , plus overtime , with a three - year employment contract			2
but when they arrived in the @entity7 , they received a fraction of the money and were warned not to leave or talk with anyone outside the farm			0
" do not escape or flee because the police or @entity51 [ @entity57 management ] will find , deport , or send you back to @entity14 , " the workers were told , according to the indictment			1
the recruitment fees paid by the workers were reportedly as much as $ 17,000 each , with much of the balance to be paid in the @entity7 , subtracted from the weekly wages			0
the indictment alleges many of the recruitment fees were financed by debts secured with the workers ' family property and homes , which the government says kept many of the employees at the mercy of the defendants			1
@entity94 , who headed international relations for @entity51 , is accused of being the liaison between the company , the guest workers and the @entity14 authorities			1
@entity94 , 44 , was picked up in suburban @entity126 on thursday and had an initial court appearance in federal court later in the day , said @entity3 spokeswoman @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity12			1
she is in federal custody and at some point will be transferred to @entity48 , @entity9 , @entity129 said			1
the first court appearance for any of the suspects is scheduled for tuesday in @entity135 in @entity48 , said special agent @entity70			0
he said the other suspects include @entity138 , 41 , who surrendered to the @entity3 in @entity139 , friday morning ; and @entity140 , 39 , a resident of @entity141 , @entity9 , who is expected to surrender to the @entity3 early next week			1
two others are residents of @entity14 and are considered fugitives , @entity70 said			1
he identified them as @entity146 and @entity147 , both females , and said @entity3 agents in the @entity150 in @entity151 will be working with @entity14 officials to apprehend them			2
if convicted , all of the defendants would face sentences ranging from five to 70 years in prison			0
the company says it provides contract labor in 15 countries , including the @entity7 , on four continents			2
" @entity163 thinks globally and acts locally with a post- 9/11 - worldview , one which understands that economies can not continue to grow and prosper without an ample , qualified and legal workforce , " says a statement on its website			2
" too , it understands the aspirations of countless workers who dream of having better jobs in better places , but who wish to return to their country of native origin when they 've completed the job			2
this fulfills both the economic and security needs of the host country			0
" @entity57 was cleared two years ago in a federal discrimination case from @entity80 , where it was accused of favoring @entity185 farm workers in the hiring and firing process on local farms			0
@entity70 said the investigation is not over			0
" there are more than a dozen @entity9 farms that utilized the labor of the alleged victims in this case , " he said			1
" none of these farms have been criminally charged in this indictment			0
the @entity3 is attempting to learn the extent that these farms were aware of the forced labor conditions of its workers			0
with few exceptions , the farms have been cooperating with our investigation			0
" and other investigations are likely , he indicated			0
" there are more people living in forced labor today than when president @entity211 signed the @entity212 , " he said			2
" as long as this is true , the @entity3 will continue to pursue organizations and individuals involved in human trafficking			0
