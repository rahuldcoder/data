-- from a @entity3 pop idol to a champion of ethnic minorities in @entity3 , singer @entity1 is a musician like no other			1
@entity1 , whose real name is @entity1 , was a student in the southern @entity3 city of @entity9 when she won a tv talent competition in the early 1990s			1
but despite finding herself on the fast - track to pop stardom , she knew from a young age her life and musical career would take her away from the mainstream			2
" ( growing up ) i always have my own idea			2
i imagine one day i will be traveler , travel @entity19 , " she says			2
" at that time i told my mother and the other kids and they were laughing at me			2
at that time @entity3 was like your mother , father work in a certain unit and child will follow them			1
" her imagination and travel led her away from the @entity3 pop scene to @entity31 that inspired the 1995 album " @entity33 "			1
it struck a chord with a global audience -- it was the first time in 45 years that a @entity3 album had been launched globally -- but also brought criticism from across @entity3 including those in @entity31			1
" that 's really , really surprising me , " she says			0
" for a time i was so miserable for that because i did n't expecting			0
and i am always hoping in the future , for some other young generation , like the artist , who do n't have to face that sort of problem			0
" before becoming @entity1 , @entity1 also faced a problem with her name in attracting a global audience			1
@entity31 and her interest in surrealism inspired the transformation			1
" i was thinking what kind of name i should have , of course should be very simple , you know the vowels very common language pronunciation			0
so i 'm thinking about it , and at that time i was traveling in @entity31 ; i 'm so in love with @entity31 , " she says			0
" so in @entity31 , @entity62 means moon			0
and i 'm also interested in @entity64 , which is surrealism			0
so i put two concepts together and make a new name for myself			0
" @entity1 has recorded four albums as @entity1 since her 1995 debut , but she has also spent much of her time promoting the ethnic culture and music of @entity3 as a @entity72 goodwill ambassador			1
" my thinking is that we have to do something definitely , especially for the ethnic minority culture			1
you know the people have liked the culture when we are traveling there , they say ' wow that 's a fantastic culture '			2
but when we left they always think that it 's so far away from us ...			0
that 's why i thought i should do something with connect with other people			0
" @entity1 was talking to @entity85 at @entity86 , the design - led heritage hotel located in @entity88 , @entity89			1
