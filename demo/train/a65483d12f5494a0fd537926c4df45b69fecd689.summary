-- @entity2 's wife is pregnant			1
i 'm told that 's how it works			1
mind you , this is n't @entity2 's first baby rodeo			1
this is the second child for him and @entity12			1
but it 's still a wildly exciting time			1
though maybe not quite as wildly exciting as an actual baby rodeo			1
of course , now , @entity2 and @entity12 are at that age ( both 31 ) where your social media feed becomes a shameless , cascading waterfall of friends ' baby photos and professional maternity shoots -- these gentle little reminders that maybe we ai n't that young anymore			1
plus , the occasional @entity28 update confirming , yes , your college roommate , @entity26 , apparently had pasta for dinner			2
there 's still a lot of that , too			2
" omg ! @entity35 ! # yolo " so , being that this is what people seem to do when there 's a bun in the oven , @entity2 asked @entity12 if she was interested in having photos done to commemorate the pregnancy of their soon - to - be daughter , @entity44			1
@entity12 said no. but @entity2 said yes			1
" i was studying for my accounting exam and the idea popped in my head that it would be funny if i took them since she did n't want to			2
" he laughed about the idea for a couple of days , and finally called up his photographer friend , @entity52			2
this would be @entity2 's surprise present to his wife			1
all he needed were some @entity57 underpants and maybe a pair of @entity12 's @entity60 shorts to achieve the " full maternity effect			1
" plus a few other odds and ends			2
@entity52 recalls getting the photo shoot request			1
" it was very unusual , " she says			2
" it 's never happened			2
" but , as a true , seasoned professional , she embraced the weirdness , and promptly gathered the aforementioned props			2
i do n't know much about being pregnant , but i suppose it somehow makes women eat like @entity77			2
to be fair , it actually sounds quite nice			2
of course , in reality , pregnancy is a grind			0
and in some very minor way , @entity2 got a little taste of what it 's like			1
" by the end of the shoot , my stomach hurt , and my lower back hurt			0
i feel as if i had a brief glimpse into the sacrifice that women make on their bodies when they become pregnant			0
" granted , he was doing a lot of pushing to get that gut out			0
despite gaining 15 pounds of " sympathy weight " since injuring his shoulder doing @entity98 , @entity2 swears his belly 's not really that big			1
but there 's a fair amount of @entity102 and @entity103 that says otherwise			0
naturally , everyone got a kick out of @entity2 's photos			1
and , by this point , it might literally be everyone			0
reality kicked in when a friend called him to say he had just seen the photos on the website for @entity113			1
yes , things move pretty fast when you make little hand hearts over your belly			0
and you 're a dude			0
still , @entity12 is his no. 1 fan			0
and his dad is right up there , too , having left him a fatherly voice mail that said , " you are crazy , boy			0
the world could use a little laughter right now			0
i mean -- that belly			0
speaking of which , @entity2 says his favorite photo is the one where he 's kissing his stomach -- that it was the perfect amount of funny and creepy			1
and the one he 's most embarrassed by ? that would be the black and white one where he 's on the bed			0
he told me , " it looks so real			0
" @entity2 says the hardest part was actually keeping a straight face			1
but , he managed , and it 's all been worth it			0
maybe even really worth it			0
he says , " i have publishers calling me for book ideas , people wanting to buy my photos			1
" but , truthfully , there 's just one thing he wants			0
" i 'm still holding out for an ice cream sponsorship ! " that , or pickles			0
