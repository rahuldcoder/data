-- @entity1 on friday sued a @entity3 clinic @entity2 and several men associated with it for flouting its drug prevention program by allegedly providing performance enhancing substances to players , the pro sports league said			1
according to reports and the @entity1 suit , filed in @entity3 's @entity14 , the clinic reportedly supplied banned performance enhancing substances to a number of current and former pro baseball players such as ex-boston @entity19 @entity18			1
" we believe we have a legitimate legal claim against the defendants , and we intend to pursue it vigorously , " said @entity21 , @entity1 's executive vice president of economics and legal affairs			2
a phone call placed friday night by @entity0 to @entity2 's lawyer was not immediately returned			0
previously , @entity0 has been unable to reach those involved in the clinic			0
and after the @entity31 story broke , a @entity0 crew went to the @entity32 , @entity3 , address of the @entity2 clinic and found its offices vacant			0
@entity36 denies performance - enhancing drugs reports the 14 - page complaint names biogenesis , its predecessor and six individuals -- among them its program director @entity2 , others at the company , someone who worked at a sports agency , a former @entity46 baseball player and a " self - proclaimed chemist " who supplied substances			1
the accused , according to @entity1 , solicited players , supplied them with drugs and offered dosage recommendations in order not to test positive for banned substances under the league 's program			1
" ( the defendants ) knowingly and intentionally caused and / or induced ... players to breach their contractual obligations under @entity1 's @entity61 and @entity62 , " the complaint said			2
the complaint did not specify how much money it is seeking , beyond that it 's more than $ 15,000			0
but it insists the league rightfully deserves to be paid given what @entity2 and its affiliates have done to the sport			0
" @entity1 has suffered damages , including the costs of ( the ) investigation , loss of goodwill , loss of revenue and profits and injury to its reputation , image , strategic advantage and fan relationships , " the league alleges in its complaint			1
after a surge in home runs in the late 1980s and 1990s -- highlighted by @entity86 and @entity87 racing to break @entity89 's single - season home run record in 1998 , followed three years later by @entity90 breaking the new record -- @entity1 came under a cloud amid allegations it had n't done enough to recognize , and combat , the use of performance enhancing substances			1
the league , in conjunction with its players ' union , in recent years has beefed up its drug testing programs and penalties			0
a number of top - level and minor league players have been suspended as a result , like @entity18 who was suspended 50 games in 2009			0
@entity2 became part of this story publicly in late january , when the @entity31 reported that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes were named in records kept over several years by the clinic			2
@entity0 was unable to independently obtain the documents the newspaper said it based its reporting on			0
and @entity31 reported earlier this month that it refused @entity1 's request for records that contributed to its story			0
one of those players named by the publication is @entity36 , a 37 - year - old @entity124 who ranks fifth in home runs in major league history			2
shortly after the @entity31 article came out , @entity128 published a story quoting unidentified sources as describing how @entity132 allegedly went to @entity36 's waterfront @entity3 mansion when summoned and injected the star player with performance - enhancing drugs , or @entity136			1
@entity36 's camp subsequently released a statement denying any connection to the @entity2 ' clinic 's owner while disputing the aforementioned reports			1
" the purported documents referenced in the story -- at least as they relate to @entity36 -- are not legitimate , " the player 's public relations agent said .			2

new : the league says @entity2 " intentionally " led players to try to defy its rules
