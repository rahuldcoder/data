@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few days ago we observed the two - year anniversary of the earthquake that devastated @entity1 , killing an estimated 220,000 people , injuring 300,000 , and leaving more than 1 million homeless			1
since that day , blame for @entity1 's acute vulnerability and subsequent slow recovery has been traded among the government , international donors and humanitarian organizations			1
but for @entity1 , placing blame is useless			1
even the day after the earthquake , beneath the rubble and dust , still lay the joy of our people -- our beloved @entity1 was still there , waiting to be rebuilt			1
today , while many bemoan the slow state of recovery , communities all over @entity1 are working hard , transforming the disaster into an opportunity			1
to be sure , there is much rebuilding work to be done , but strong @entity1 women are critical to the effort and leading the way			1
photos : @entity1 's children , two years later yes , progress is slow			1
more than 500,000 people are still living in tents in an estimated 758 camps			0
too many families are suffering without access to clean water and health care , and a devastating cholera outbreak has killed 6,700 @entity1 , with more getting sick every day			1
an estimated 70 % of the population do not have regular employment ; job opportunities remain very scarce			2
but two years is hardly enough time to rebuild a country that was hit so badly , and already so crippled			2
even before the earthquake , @entity1 was the poorest country in the @entity48 , with almost 80 % living below the poverty line			1
but now , there are very visible signs of hope : nearly half of all earthquake rubble has been removed , for example , and some 430 kilometers ( 270 miles ) of roads have been rebuilt or repaired			2
for families and communities fractured by the earthquake , progress has been less visible			1
they have had to come together to rebuild lives and livelihoods , often in new and creative ways			2
children are going back to school and learning how to protect themselves against cholera , parents are creating small businesses and adapting to new farming methods , and community groups are developing systems to access basic services like clean water			1
these innovations and rebuilding strategies , which began as means of survival , are laying the groundwork for a new @entity1			1
much of this groundwork is being laid locally , and by women			2
there are so many @entity1 who are eager to do more to help their communities ; they just need a small window of opportunity			1
there are many organizations helping to create those opportunities			0
@entity89 alone has seen more than 1,600 women receive literacy and budget training , and small grants to start businesses to help support their families			1
in the rural area of @entity98 , farmers have developed 4,748 plots of land on which trees , crops , fruit , and livestock are raised together in order to maximize productivity and land use			0
local groups also led an effort to rebuild a workshop in the @entity112 neighborhood of greater @entity0 to help more than 200 artisans restart their work as steel - craft and construction material workers			1
one amazing @entity1 is @entity117 © , a young woman in the @entity120 valley of northern @entity1			1
she is one of 4.5 million @entity1 who earn their living as small - scale farmers or part of the agricultural sector			1
@entity126 recently decided to try her hand at growing rice using a new technique called the @entity130			0
@entity130 uses less seed , less fertilizer , and less water , and grows more rice			0
so @entity126 found a landowner near where she lives who would allow her to experiment on a small , 100 - square - meter ( 1,100 - square - foot ) plot			0
the other farmers teased her when she transplanted her seedlings individually in rows , spaced farther apart , instead of in clumps of four or five , which would allow them to grow stronger roots and better resist pests and diseases			0
several weeks later , a heavy rain flattened the rice growing near @entity126 's plot , but hers survived			0
by the end of october , @entity126 was expecting a strong harvest , and there is suddenly a lot of interest in @entity130 in her community			0
there is now a pilot project to teach 135 farmers the @entity130 system			0
@entity159 , who lost her husband in the earthquake , lives in @entity162 with her 2 - year - old daughter , her mother , and a nephew			0
@entity159 is the president of one of several water committees in @entity162 , a large camp of 20,000 people , where @entity89 has installed about 1.6 kilometers ( a mile ) of new underground piping to deliver clean water			1
she received training from @entity89 to manage water and sanitation facilities in her area			0
her committee purchases water from a supplier and sells the water at designated kiosks , where camp residents are taught how to buy from safe sources			0
the profits are used to help the community buy more water and storage supplies			0
@entity159 says the key to the committee 's success is managing its own system			0
she said , " we want to form our own company to collect and remove rubbish , and then to employ young people who ca n't find work			0
this is our community now , and we should be responsible			0
i feel happy and proud to be involved in this work			0
" two years later , as we commemorate the lives of family and friends lost , we begin a new chapter with much work ahead of us			0
for @entity1 to truly survive and build a stronger country , they must be empowered			1
resilience can become resignation -- and we should fight any resignation to conditions that are unacceptable for human life			0
citizens like @entity126 and @entity159 are not " victims " of the earthquake			2
they make up a new @entity1 , an aspect of life that you may not see in many of the news stories about this second anniversary			2
but to us , they represent the promise of a vibrant @entity1 future			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

*yolette* @entity226 : @entity1 not blaming others for earthquake ruin , they *'re* working to rebuild
she says progress slow ; clean water , health care , jobs scarce ; cholera has killed thousands
women in particular leading local efforts at farming , building small business , water systems
@entity224 : innovations empower citizens to not be resigned to bad conditions , to build new @entity1
