-- was @entity2 's assault on @entity4 's brain a political masterstroke that will make her presidential campaign more difficult ? or a ham - fisted attack that will contribute to the persistent unpopularity of the @entity9 ? the answer , to many a @entity9 's regret , is both			1
whatever victory republicans digest from this blow will leave a bitter taste			2
@entity4 has n't yet been president , though it feels like she is running for reelection			1
that is part of mrs. @entity4 's problem			1
the constant division her name invites has been with us now for decades			2
who wants to continue those battles ? like @entity27 or @entity28 , at times it does n't matter which side of the @entity31 conflict we take			2
we are exhausted by the relentless requirement that we engage them			2
age and health are always issues in major political races , and fairly so , but they are usually aired gracelessly			1
i served my apprenticeship in politics working for mad - genius @entity9 pollster and strategist @entity43			1
while he was mapping the campaign for brassy , upstart @entity46 , @entity43 came up with a unique strategy to do what was thought impossible : defeat in a primary an untouchable @entity9 icon -- legendary @entity54 sen. @entity53			1
@entity53 , a liberal @entity9 , was out of step with @entity56 's @entity9 but @entity9 voters had too much respect for the old senator to replace him			1
a near octogenarian , @entity53 had slowed a step and was beginning to slur his speech , presenting the initial symptoms of @entity64 , which would fell him within the decade			2
@entity43 's strategy ? give conservative @entity9 primary voters permission to say publicly what only a few whispered privately -- and @entity43 was none too subtle			1
@entity43 released an attack ad that wrinkled the noses of @entity54 's political elite			2
its purpose being impropriety , it ended with the memorable line , " and now , at age 76 and in failing health , he wants six more years			1
" @entity54 's left - leaning upper - crust gasped , but @entity43 did n't stop there			2
the inspired part of the strategy was the second step : @entity43 had planned for the @entity46 campaign to fire him for the negative assault			1
that would not only distance @entity46 from the attack and leave his candidate wearing a white hat , it would also generate another delicious round of news coverage			2
the " @entity96 " debate kept the story alive for the remaining days before the election			2
sometimes , in politics as in chess , a knight sacrifices himself to take the queen			2
@entity104 ' career came to its end			2
@entity2 is not on the ballot in 2016			1
at least in the short term , in any brutal exchange between a brass - knuckled political operative and @entity4 , guess who wins and who loses ? @entity31 has already lost once , running as the candidate of experience against a younger candidate of hope and change			1
political tides often wash in as high as -- if not higher than -- they have before			2
it could all happen to @entity4 again			1
my experience is that once @entity122 moves forward a generation , it seldom moves backward			0
it 's not @entity4 's age that is the issue , but how young or old she would make the country			1
@entity2 has opened the door to @entity31 's real weakness : her lack of vision is more of an issue than her years			1
that other @entity31 @entity31 had no such debility			0
he was always the candidate of the future			0
his song was " @entity135			0
" his pledge , repeated nearly two dozen times in his acceptance speech at the 1996 @entity140 convention , in his campaign against @entity143 's @entity142 , was to build " @entity144 to the @entity145			2
" president @entity31 was inspired to enter politics , he admits , as a 16 - year - old on a visit to @entity149 , in a moment captured by cameras , when he shook hands with the @entity154 's president @entity153 , whom he then emulated			2
@entity155 was attacked for his age and mental acuity			2
@entity122 learned he was an optimist with a glorious sense of humor and a vision of them that lit the world as a " @entity164 , " so they found him forever young , regardless of his maturity and experience			0
@entity153 , @entity31 and @entity155 were young because they kept us young			0
unlike those predecessors , however , @entity4 is n't known for her optimism or inspiring vision			1
she is a pragmatist , not a futurist			0
@entity122 has known her for a long time			0
even after 20 years , a stay in the @entity176 , a career in the @entity178 and a tour as secretary of state , we do not know what stars she would follow			0
it is not unreasonable to ask where a candidate would go before we trust her to lead us there			0
it 's hard to imagine that only now , after decades in the public eye , @entity4 would suddenly discover her destination			1
unfinished business @entity4 has only one attribute that makes her politically youthful and connects her to our future			1
it is , however , a powerful one : @entity122 has yet to have a female president			0
the power of that incomplete task should not be understated			0
in making the decision to nominate and elect our first black president , @entity122 rightly believes it acted as a good and noble nation			0
it advanced the defining belief that we are a country offering equal opportunity to everyone			0
in making that choice , however , @entity122 also made another decision : not to elect our first female president			0
women were left at the back of the bus			0
as i travel the country these days and speak to audiences of varied political persuasions , i am often struck by the quiet but growing movement of women , especially younger women , @entity219 and @entity9 , who believe their time has come			1
much of @entity4 's support says , " it is our turn			1
" is that enough to keep @entity31 " forever young " , like @entity155 ? not completely			0
@entity155 's eternal youth , like @entity153 's , was actually the understanding that he would keep our country " forever young "			2
without similar vision and optimism , @entity4 's crusade remains only a quest for personal achievement			1
to that purpose , @entity2 has opened a wound that will bleed and hurt @entity31			1
unfortunately , it will also hurt the @entity9 @entity2 aims to help			1
@entity9 has its own problems right now the @entity9 is a cause few are proud to join			1
we are a dark and purposeless confederation , known for primarily for saying " no " and telling people , not what they can be , but what they should not do			0
we seem to employ our principles only with only the darkest and most defensive intentions			0
this assault on @entity4 will only aggravate that perception of the @entity9 , and the moment could n't be worse			1
many young voters have had their hearts broken by president @entity250			0
in return for the dreams , hopes and votes they invested in him , @entity250 has rewarded them with huge student debt , no jobs , declining prospects , and an intergenerational transfer of wealth from their empty pockets to their gluttonous elders			0
those young voters are available to republicans who would lift their eyes over the horizon and lead them to something better			0
they are not eager to stand beside @entity2 holding a bloody ax			1
please do n't think me apologetic			0
i love negative political campaigns and have run more than a few of them			0
i believe @entity9 have an obligation to disqualify a failed , industrial - age political philosophy that is leading our nation to decline			1
we have responsibility to warn voters about hot stoves and shout an alert not to touch them			0
yet , our ultimate obligation is to cook something and feed a population hungry for leadership			0
it remains our mission to inspire and take an ever - hopeful people from a great nation to an even better one			0
ultimately , this is a collective failure , belonging to all but a few @entity9			1
@entity9 leaders and sages rarely make an effective case that their principles offer the only possible path to a future of promise , progress and prosperity			1
when we do n't lift those principles before voters , when we do n't step up and lead , we are defined only by tactical wedge issues that divide and not big principles that inspire , unite , and attract the next generation			0
in this battle , we have dug our hole a little deeper and exposed the @entity9 's lack of leadership			1
it is a big price to pay for a party in need of optimism and vision			0
it is also a steep cost to a country in need of renewal , confidence , and big dreams			0
join us on @entity322 / @entity321 .			0

@entity324 looks at @entity2 's assault on @entity4 's health and age
he says his language probably was *reckless* , but could succeed as part of a larger strategy
but , he argues , it also continues to damage the @entity9 brand
