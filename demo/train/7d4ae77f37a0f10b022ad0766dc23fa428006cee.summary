-- the internet empowers each one of us to speak , create , learn and share			1
today , more than two billion people are online â € ” about a third of the planet			2
the internet has become one of the motors of the 21st century economy , allowing all of us to reach a global audience at a click of a mouse and creating hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of jobs			2
according to a new @entity19 study , the net already accounts of 13 % of @entity21 business output , impacting every industry , from communications to cars , and restaurants to retail			1
not since @entity26 invented the printing press , or @entity28 the telephone , has a human invention empowered so many and offered so much possibility for benefiting humankind			2
today , this free and open net is under threat			1
some 42 countries filter and censor content out of the 72 studied by the @entity37			1
this does n't even count serial offenders such as @entity40 and @entity41			2
over the past two years , @entity42 says governments have enacted 19 new laws threatening online free expression			2
some of these governments are trying to use a closed - door meeting of @entity48 that opens on december 3 in @entity49 to further their repressive agendas			1
accustomed to media control , these governments fear losing it to the open internet			2
they worry about the spread of unwanted ideas			2
they are angry that people might use the internet to criticize their governments			2
the @entity63 is bringing together regulators from around the world to renegotiate a decades - old treaty that was focused on basic telecommunications , not the internet			1
some proposals leaked to the @entity71 website from participating states could permit governments to justify censorship of legitimate speech -- or even justify cutting off internet access by reference to amendments to the @entity79 ( @entity80 )			2

others have proposed moving the responsibilities of the private sector system that manages domain names and internet addresses to the @entity94			1
yet other proposals would require any internet content provider , small or large , to pay new tolls in order to reach people across borders			1
the upshot ? the next garage - based phenomena would face a steep and probably insurmountable financial hurdle in its effort to become the next @entity105 , @entity106 or @entity107			1
let us be clear : we do not advocate for an end to the @entity63			0
the @entity94 agency has helped the world manage radio spectrum and wired and wireless telephone networks , bringing much needed investment to the developing world			0
but this inter-governmental agency is the wrong place to make decisions about the future of the internet			0
only governments have a vote at the @entity63			0
this includes governments that do not support a free and open internet			0
engineers , companies , and people that build and use the web have no vote			0
the multi-stakeholder model of internet policy development that is the hallmark of the @entity134 , the @entity135 , the @entity136 , the @entity137 , among many others , is the only sensible way forward			0
transparency and openness are keys to informed participation in policy making			0
the proposals for amending the @entity80 are not generally available to the public or other stakeholders			0
the treaty conference and proposals in @entity49 are formally confidential			0
we consider this to be a serious deficiency and an inhibitor to thoughtful policy development			0
at @entity154 , we see and feel the dangers of the government - led net crackdown			1
we operate in about 150 countries around the globe			1
our services - including @entity161 , @entity105 and @entity162 , to @entity163 and @entity164 - have been blocked at some point , temporarily or permanently , in more than 30 different countries			1
we 're not alone in standing up			0
users , experts and organizations from around the world have voiced their opposition to governments justifying their regulation of the internet through the @entity63 's @entity175			0
these include countries not just in the @entity177 , but also @entity179 internet leaders such as @entity180 and @entity179 beacons such as @entity182			1
in all , more than 1000 organizations from more than 160 countries have raised concerns about the upcoming closed - door meeting in @entity49			1
internet lovers around the world can learn more about the issue on our website -- and if they choose to do so , can pledge their support			0
while some governments argue that the internet needs new global rules to speed its rollout in the developing world , we believe the present market - driven approach is best positioned to keep up with the net 's exponential growth			1
broadband services are being rolled out			0
within a few years the net is predicted to be serving four billion users -- more than half of humanity ! the bottom - up , loosely - coupled , bilateral and multi-stakeholder practices that have created the network of networks we call the internet allow for a broad range of business models			1
the critical technical standards developed by the @entity134 and the @entity218 create interoperability			0
a state - controlled system of regulation is not only unnecessary , it would almost invariably raise costs and prices and interfere with the rapid and organic growth of the internet we have seen since its commercial emergence in the 1990s			1
the net 's future is far from assured and history offers much warning			1
within a few decades of @entity26 's creation , princes and priests moved to restrict the right to print books			0
history is rife with examples of governments taking actions to " protect " their citizens from harm by controlling access to information and inhibiting freedom of expression and other freedoms outlined in the @entity249			0
we must make sure , collectively , that the internet avoids a similar fate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255			1

some 42 countries filter and censor content out of the 72 studied by the @entity37
according to an @entity19 study , the net already accounts of 13 % of @entity21 business output
at @entity154 , @entity255 says the company sees dangers of a government - led net crackdown
a state - controlled regulatory system is unnecessary and would invariably raise costs
