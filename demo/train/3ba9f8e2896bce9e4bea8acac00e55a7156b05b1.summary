@entity1 tigers in @entity3 appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction , with the country 's environment minister announcing a 30 % increase in the endangered species ' population since 2011			1
" our latest estimate today is that @entity3 has 70 % of the world 's tiger population and we have now 2,226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [ up from 1,706 in 2011 ] and this is a great achievement			1
it is a net increase of 30 % over the last estimation , " environment minister @entity19 said in a statement monday			1
researchers involved in the study , the third of its kind carried out in @entity3 , say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats			0
@entity31 , head of the @entity32 at the @entity33 , which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade , welcomed news of the study , saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in march			1
" i think it has set @entity3 apart from some of the other tiger range countries			1
if you look at @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , there 's more emphasis on tigers in captivity , farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild , " she says to @entity2			2
@entity3 's once - thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching , a reduction in prey , habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area			1
although preliminary results of the government 's study are promising , @entity31 warns against complacency			2
" while this is good news from @entity3 , i do n't think anyone is sitting back and saying ' we 've won			0
' the demand within @entity43 for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue			0
and so it 's a constant battle			0
" a major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade , where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders , such as mountain passes			1
" the criminals have changed their practice			0
and there 's no evidence of any enforcement there , " she says			0
a historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as @entity3 and @entity43 , the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics , @entity31 says			1
" @entity101 are major indicator of the health of the environment , certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit			0
but they are the water gods , if you like			0
they are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change			0
" there 's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers			2
" and if today 's results are anything to go by , @entity31 says @entity3 appears to be leading that charge			2
" @entity3 , despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas , is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation			2

@entity31 from the @entity33 says this has " set @entity3 apart from other tiger range countries "
