@entity0 -- executing a successful remake of a video game can be like shooting blindfolded , and that 's especially true when you 're dealing with the fervent following behind @entity8 's " @entity9 " series			1
longtime fans look for any reason to balk at attempts to repackage their beloved games , and for " @entity9 : @entity18 , " people who follow its development closely have reasons to be skeptical			1
it 's the first game wholly developed without intervention from @entity21 , the company that created " @entity9 " but which has since severed ties with @entity8			1
" @entity18 " is available only for the @entity24 starting tuesday , the 10th anniversary of the original " @entity9 , " which launched alongside @entity8 's first home gaming console			1
the game adds high - definition graphics and a big - production musical score to the original , without changing much else			2
producers often look at remakes as a way to add their signature to a well - regarded work , but the team shepherding " @entity9 " went to extraordinary lengths to preserve the feel of its decade - old model			1
@entity41 , a development director for @entity42 , the division @entity8 created to specifically handle the " @entity9 " franchise , stressed that " @entity18 " was created to appease fans			1
the $ 40 price tag , versus the standard $ 60 price for new games , fits with that model			0
" this is a celebration of the past			0
" @entity41 leads a team of a few people within 343 industries that 's tasked with making the final say about whether a storyline for new games , books and other media fits with " the @entity9 canon , " he said			1
with several bestselling books and more products in the works , this is a fragile process			0
sometimes @entity41 has to temper his own instincts in order to stay true to precedents set by earlier games			1
for example , he wanted to hide a rocket launcher behind a waterfall in the second level of " @entity18 " as an easter egg for explorers			1
his team challenged him on it , and so he conceded : no rockets , he lamented as he motioned to the waterfall while demonstrating the game			2
designing a familiar but unique ' @entity9 ' the team within 343 industries that 's working on " @entity9 , " the major new game scheduled to be released late next year , has been given more creative freedom than the external group that 's programming " @entity18			1
" @entity85 , the executive producer for " @entity9 , " said that being able to consult with @entity41 's team makes it " incredibly easy " to keep their stories straight			1
but @entity90 , the creative director for the game , said that despite the help , the breadth of the " @entity9 " franchise creates a minefield for storytellers to traverse			1
" there are times when we 're thinking about all of the different interconnected storylines , " @entity90 said			0
" that 's really important to us , because we believe in the universe and want to keep the universe consistent			2
" they declined to talk much about " @entity9 , " but they said it will strike a delicate balance between keeping up with innovations in other first - person - shooter games and keeping the mechanics familiar to fans of the series			1
the game will have a familiar control scheme , using two analog sticks for movement , rather than doing a drastic departure with , say , @entity120 camera navigation , @entity42 executives said			0
it may incorporate limited @entity120 functions for throwing grenades or toggling settings using voice commands , like those in " @entity18 , " they said			1
" one of the things that 's really important to us is that the game feels , at its core , like ' @entity9 , ' " @entity90 said			1
" it feels like ' @entity9 , ' yet it feels new and unique			1
" staying true to ' @entity9 ' in ' anniversary ' edition that same criteria are not what 's driving " @entity18			1
" the primary concern for developers was that it feel almost identical to the original " @entity9			1
" one roadblock that @entity139 , the team behind the single - player element of " @entity18 , " ran into was a result of running an old game on the @entity24 's faster hardware , @entity41 said			1
the game just felt smoother and speedier , he said			0
so the team tweaked the code in order to reproduce glitches found in the original			2
" if things like that happen with physics or animation , and we go change it , then we 're changing the game , " @entity41 said after watching an alien in the game make an unintentional , jittery movement			0
" some things we had to go back and break to make it authentic			0
" but like @entity41 's failed attempt at hiding a rocket launcher , @entity162 wanted to do more			0
@entity41 and his team had to talk the developers out of overreaching			2
" they just wanted to put their own stamp on it , " @entity41 said			0
" but we said , ' this is n't about putting your stamp or our stamp			0
' " new features for ' @entity18 ' while the characters and scenes from the first " @entity9 " have been re-created with an attention to detail that takes advantage of the @entity24 's processor , " @entity18 " players can switch to the vintage look at any time , except during video sequences			1
this results in a brief pause , but it can be a welcome distraction throughout the game			0
the feature lets players compare today 's standards to what was cutting edge a decade ago			0
at some points , like in grassy environments , the original holds up surprisingly well , but the aesthetic changes in " @entity18 " are n't just for show			1
lighting effects and brighter textures on walls were used to guide the player along in places where it was once difficult to navigate			0
these changes are not likely to upset even sensitive fans			0
perhaps more controversial , the developers made some significant alterations to a particular character and added video terminals throughout the game			0
both were done for the purpose of broadening the plot and for relating it to games and books that have come out since the first game , @entity41 said			0
the floating blue - and - metallic orb named 343 @entity221 , which @entity8 's @entity42 took its name from , has received a sort of makeover			0
the wisecracking robot , which guides players through certain levels but was known to stray , has been made more visible and talkative			0
his lines have been updated to hint at story elements from books and future games , @entity41 said			0
likewise , the terminals placed throughout the levels , another element not found in the original , let players watch short clips that hint at events in " @entity9 " and other " @entity238 " media , @entity41 said			1
the online multiplayer component in " @entity18 " has more in common with " @entity9 : reach " than it does with the original			1
it uses the same " reach " game engine that was designed by @entity21			0
certain @entity244 , an @entity246 , @entity245 , game developer , rebuilt versions of a few maps and weapons from the first " @entity9 " to be played with friends			2
" @entity9 : reach " owners will be able to access the modes for free			2
the true test : fan appraisals you can never quite gauge how fans will react to seeing one of their beloved entertainment artifacts recreated for a new generation			0
remember when @entity260 remastered " @entity261 " in the late 1990s ? " @entity267 shot first , " a reference to a particular scene from the original movie that was changed , remains the bane of many geeks			0
eagle - eye followers of " @entity9 " have begun grumbling over the addition of metallic fins lining the bottom of the ring that surrounds the planet in the game			2
execs from 343 industries initially said the fins were present in the first game but not visible due to the low graphic resolution			0
in fact , the fins are an important element of the plot in the @entity284 novel " @entity9 : @entity286 , " which is set to come out in january , @entity41 said			2
without them , the game would be inconsistent with the book			0
as " @entity261 " fans nervously await the three - dimensional remakes that are in the works , " @entity18 " players with television sets that support the feature will get to play in @entity297 glory			2
" @entity18 " and " @entity261 " have one more thing in common			2
the musical score for the new " @entity9 " game was recorded using @entity260 ' @entity301			2
" @entity18 " includes the ability to switch back to the music from the original game , " though i do n't see why you 'd want to , " @entity41 said .			1

" @entity9 : @entity18 " is a remake of the original for @entity24
the developers went to great pains to stay true to the first " @entity238 's " *formula*
the team working on " @entity9 " has more freedom to flex their creative *muscles*
