in @entity13 , the sound of residents banging pots and pans together echoed down the streets as another face - off between police and anti-government protesters played out			1

thousands of demonstrators calling for prime minister @entity26 's resignation attempted to return to the square and park sunday , only to be pushed back by police			1

police had warned demonstrators who have occupied @entity13 's last remaining green space for more than two weeks to depart voluntarily or face being ejected			1
while the anti-government protests are unlikely to threaten the rule of @entity26 , who has been one of @entity1 's most popular leaders and is credited with the country 's decade of economic growth , they are raising questions about what critics say is a growing authoritarian rule			2
for his part , @entity26 accuses outsiders of taking advantage of the protests at @entity21			2
earlier sunday , thousands of @entity26 's supporters gathered at a rally a few miles from @entity20			1
they waved flags and sang songs at a rally that was widely viewed as a re-election rally for the prime minister			2

" in @entity0 , authorities had warned against a gathering to honor @entity71 , who was shot during protests two weeks ago			1

" we have reached out with our hands , " he said			0

root of protests the unrest began in @entity13 nearly three weeks ago , when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze @entity21 and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of 19th - century @entity155 barracks			1
protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society			0
@entity1 was founded after secularists in the early 20th century defeated @entity137 @entity155 forces , and many modern - day secularists frown on @entity155 symbols			0
the protests broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down on demonstrators			0
