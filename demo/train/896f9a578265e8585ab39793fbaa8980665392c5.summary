@entity0 -- @entity2 pressed the @entity3 on wednesday to choose between " a real partnership " with @entity5 or an " illusory " relationship with @entity3 ally @entity7			1
@entity0 said it 's sticking with @entity7			2
" as to choosing , the @entity3 has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of @entity7 , " secretary of state @entity10 said wednesday			2
she spelled out the @entity14 administration 's stance after @entity2 foreign minister @entity15 called @entity7 's government " a special project for the @entity3			1
" " and we are aware that the @entity3 is uptight about this project , " @entity15 said in remarks broadcast on @entity2 television			2
" but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts			0
" @entity32 , amid reports that @entity2 troops remained on the move wednesday , pushed @entity2 to abide by a cease - fire signed tuesday by the @entity2 and @entity7 presidents			1
@entity2 military action in @entity7 " must stop and must stop now , " @entity32 said			1
@entity32 said @entity5 already faced " quite significant " diplomatic consequences over its conflict with @entity7 before tuesday 's cease - fire agreement , which calls for @entity2 and @entity7 troops to return to pre-conflict positions			1
@entity14 said reports he had received were contrary to @entity2 assurances that it had halted military operations			1
@entity14 said he was told the @entity2 military had blocked @entity7 's major east - west highway , and had soldiers at the main port at @entity48			1
there were reports that some ships had been attacked , he said			0
@entity2 has likely moved additional troops into the disputed @entity7 provinces and into @entity7 proper over the past several days , several administration officials told @entity1 on wednesday			2
the officials said the @entity3 now believes @entity2 may have 15,000 or more troops in the region			2
that would be an increase from the 8,000 - 10,000 the @entity3 government estimated when the fighting began			0
a @entity14 administration official stressed that the scope of @entity2 's military effort remains unclear			1
any violations of the cease - fire would call into question @entity2 's " suitability " as an international partner , @entity32 told reporters before leaving on a diplomatic trip to @entity73			1
@entity14 administration officials told @entity1 the @entity3 and its @entity76 allies were considering kicking @entity2 out of the @entity77 , the group of the world 's largest industrial economies , and other international organizations as punishment for its actions in @entity7			1
@entity32 discounted concerns that @entity5 would no longer assist @entity0 on thorny diplomatic issues such as efforts to halt nuclear programs in @entity88 and @entity89 , saying it had its own interests at stake			0
" let 's be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that @entity2 and the @entity3 have engaged in on @entity88 or @entity89 , " she said			1
" again , it 's not a favor to the @entity3			0
" @entity2 sent troops and tanks into the breakaway @entity7 region of @entity104 last week after @entity7 's military acted to clamp down on @entity2 - linked separatists there			1
separatists in @entity104 want independence -- or unification with @entity110 , which is in @entity2			0
the conflict quickly spread to other parts of @entity7 , including @entity113 , another separatist region			0
@entity7 has been a close @entity3 ally , contributing troops to the war in @entity117 and seeking to join @entity118 with @entity0 's support			2
in a @entity1 interview wednesday , @entity7 president @entity120 criticized the @entity3 for not doing more to help his nation			2
watch @entity120 fault the @entity3 response » " @entity3 is losing the whole region , and this is the region of eastern and central @entity73 , " said @entity120 , who called for the @entity3 and @entity76 powers to send peacekeepers to the region			0
" this is much bigger than any other place where there is @entity3 influence , and this is the most natural allies of @entity3			0
" but later wednesday , in an interview with @entity1 's " @entity135 , " @entity120 seemed to have a change of heart			0
he said that after speaking with president @entity14 earlier in the day , he felt " there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity			0
" " i never accused the @entity3 in the first place of anything , " he said			0
" i just said that the @entity2 mistook some of the statements at certain levels			0
" @entity32 defended the administration 's response to the fighting			0
watch @entity14 express support for @entity7 's democracy » " i do n't think you can have any doubt but that the @entity3 has , from the very beginning , believed that the @entity104 situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully , as we 've been working for months and months and months to do , but that @entity2 seriously overreached , that @entity2 engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in @entity104 , " she said			1
@entity3 officials said they warned @entity120 not to provoke @entity2 militarily by sending @entity7 troops into @entity104 and they had ruled out any @entity3 military action to defend @entity7			1
@entity32 spoke after @entity14 's announcement that @entity3 aircraft and ships would deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the fighting			1
@entity14 and @entity32 warned @entity2 not to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian aid , noting that tuesday 's @entity172 - brokered cease - fire allows for the delivery of international relief , and expressed concern over reports that @entity2 units were continuing to advance into @entity7 cities despite tuesday 's cease - fire			1
watch @entity2 tanks move toward @entity181 » " we expect @entity2 to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in @entity7 , and we expect all @entity2 forces that entered @entity7 in recent days to withdraw from that country , " @entity14 said			1
@entity32 will travel to @entity172 and then head to @entity181 , @entity14 said			2
next week , @entity32 will travel to @entity118 headquarters in @entity188 , @entity189			0
@entity2 's move into @entity7 came amid a struggle between the @entity3 and @entity2 for influence within @entity73			1
from @entity2 's point of view , @entity3 support for @entity7 is a direct threat to its influence			1
by striking heavily in @entity7 , @entity5 is sending a signal to other former @entity199 republics , such as @entity200 and @entity201 , said @entity202 , the director of the @entity203 at the @entity204 in @entity0			0
" if i were a neighbor of @entity2 and i saw what @entity2 had done in @entity7 , i would be very nervous , " @entity202 said			2
" i think those countries that are leaning toward the @entity207 are very nervous today			0
