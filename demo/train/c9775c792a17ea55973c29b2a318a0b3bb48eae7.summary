over the @entity0 -- the @entity2 dips to the marked spot on the right , tipping closer towards the newly set search zone in the southern @entity0			1
the entire right window of the spotter 's seat is filled with azure blue , zooming by at 302 mph			2
we 're 500 feet above the ocean , but to my untrained eye , it looks so close it 's as if i 'm on a high diving board skimming a swirling sea			1
" we saw a couple of things on our way in , " explains @entity19 lt. @entity18 , the tactical coordinator of @entity20 , the call sign for friday 's mission to seek out debris from missing @entity24			1
the @entity2 is a @entity28 souped up with classified @entity30 government electronics and intelligence , powered by jets that move it more nimbly than any consumer plane on the civilian market			1
i 'd love to show you a picture of it , but the @entity39 forbids any pictures by civilians , ordering me to leave all electronic equipment on the ground			2
petty officer 1st class @entity44 called for the " mark on top , " the signal for the @entity2 crew to immediately mark the coordinates on the map			1
pillars spotted white objects floating in the distance			2
i 'm one of three reporters on this embed to the new search area			1
just hours before , the @entity59 government said credible evidence supported moving the search 680 miles northeast of the prior search zone			1
i 'm clutching the military green life vest on this tilting jet , wondering if this might just be the debris of flight 370			2
we make a second pass over the mark			0
the 360 - degree rotation camera positioned just behind the front landing gear spins around , capturing something in the water			2
lt. @entity75 , the patrol plane commander , calls in three items to the regional communications center : the white objects spotted by @entity79 , an orange rope and a blue - green bag			1
the @entity2 requests that a boat head to the objects and check on them			1
but the items do n't appear important enough to drop a tracking buoy			0
four other planes will report similar debris to the @entity59 from the new search area			1
the @entity2 continues on , in the hunt to find debris from the missing plane			1
" mowing the ocean " the two - hour , 20 - minute flight to the new search zone is casual and lighthearted , as the @entity19 crew adjusts to journalists peppering them with questions			1
the @entity2 , described by @entity28 as the world 's most advanced anti-submarine , anti-surface warfare aircraft , flies along a bright fuchsia line on the radar screen			1
the flight plan estimates a 3,000 - mile trip			0
once in the search zone , the fuchsia line forms a rectangle , with the plane crossing a horizontal path of about 200 miles , heading north 13 miles , then back across the 200 miles			1
it repeats the pattern twice			0
the plane will fly low to surface , at 500 feet			1
lt. @entity113 , the @entity2 's patrol plane pilot , calls it " mowing the ocean			1
" at the search area , the chatter stops			1
the crew 's voices lower to a whisper over their closed communications on headsets			0
this is the ninth trip to the @entity0 for the @entity125 - deployed naval crew			1
on half of those trips , says lt. @entity75 , the team has spotted something			2
today 's weather is in stark contrast to yesterday because " visibility 's been awesome , one of the best two days we 've had , " says @entity75 , the commander			0
the current is so calm that the plane 's shadow follows on the water 's surface , perfect and zooming below			1
if something 's out there , @entity75 says , " oh yeah , we 'd see it			0
" but finding something and finding the plane 's debris are two very different discoveries			2
" every mission we see dolphins and seaweed , " says @entity145 , shaking his head			0
" every time , i get like that			0
see it it in the distance , then get excited			0
and then find out its seaweed			0
we want to find something			0
" pillars ' near - boyish enthusiasm about the mission is infectious , in stark contrast to the seriousness of his eyes as they track a pattern across his spotter 's window			0
you can tell @entity44 wants to sit at the window as long as he can , rotating out only when his judgment tells him he needs to rest his eyes			0
farther down what the crew calls " the rail , " because of the side - by - side radar monitors and chairs , sits @entity18 , the tactical coordinator			0
he 's in charge of the operation outside the cockpit			0
" our mission is to find it , " says @entity18 , his @entity184 drawl curling around his serious words			0
" do i feel it ? yeah			0
i want to give them answers			0
" by " them " he means the families of the @entity194 passengers			0
the @entity2 crew , all pilots and crew aboard a plane , feel a kinship with the lives lost in the sky and the families left wondering			1
" i think if i was in their shoes , i 'd want proof , " says lt. @entity204 who , along with @entity113 and @entity75 , is one of three patrol plane pilots on this mission			1
" not knowing is the hard thing , right ? " silence the @entity2 continues quietly			1
the crew chat into their headphones , inaudible above the noise of the jet			0
beyond the one sighting early into the search , there 's been only vast , calm sea			1
about 1,500 miles into the trip , halfway through the search , the crew prepares to drop a " sonobuoy			2
" the @entity2 is equipped with these devices , which it ejects into the ocean to establish drift rate by transmitting a radio frequency signal to the aircraft			2
the last search zone was so dynamic that it had no pattern and moved 150 yards in three minutes			2
with a muted " whoop " sound , the sonobuoy is ejected			0
i can see a faint white parachute from the plane 's video camera for a second and then it 's gone into the endless blue of the ocean			2
the light fading on the day , @entity79 is in his final shift at his spotter 's window			0
the infrared camera comes on ; the blue sea is green and black on the grainy screen			0
the pilots announce the @entity2 is climbing to 37,000 feet , lifting out of the search zone and returning to @entity252			1
the team has had one spotting -- at best , a possible lead			2
it returns to the airport , greeted by another @entity2 that now joins the mission , more air power to try to bring the pieces of this puzzle home			2
hopes dashed as orange objects turn out to be fishing equipment get up to speed on the latest developments a flight attendant 's husband wants to give children answers , but has none			0
