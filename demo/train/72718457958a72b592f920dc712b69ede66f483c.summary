-- alleged @entity2 operative @entity1 , accused of playing a role in the deadly bombings of the embassies in @entity6 and @entity7 in 1998 , denied terrorism charges when he appeared in federal court in @entity10 tuesday			1
he told the judge he played no role in @entity2 's 1998 attacks			2
we can expect the prosecution to lay out his alleged involvement in detail , provide evidence of his close ties to @entity20 , detail his computer skills and , crucially , present information about photographs of the @entity25 embassy in @entity26 he is alleged to have taken before the attack			1
what we wo n't hear is how his trial may benefit @entity2 today			1
@entity30 has oil and is one of @entity34 's richest nations			2
in the two years since dictator @entity37 was overthrown , @entity2 and its @entity36 allies have become stronger there			1
@entity25 army @entity40 soldiers seized @entity1 on october 5 from outside his house in the @entity30 capital @entity43			1
his arrest was followed by the kidnapping and subsequent release of @entity30 's prime minister @entity47 -- an incident he called an attempted coup			2
the country , according to the justice minister , is on the edge of becoming a failed state			0
there is no national army or police			0
militias like the one that took the prime minister hold sway			0
who calls the shots ? who has the real power ? it appears that is being determined not through politics but by confrontation ; and right now in some parts of the country the @entity69 have a strong hand			0
@entity74 's trial in @entity10 will influence events inside @entity30 and may provide ammunition to the @entity69			1
@entity30 's justice minister @entity77 says he trusts the @entity25 justice system , that @entity1 is innocent until proven guilty			1
but that 's the rub			0
such a statement angers @entity30 's islamists , who are implacably hostile to the @entity25 and will use the @entity30 government 's relationship with @entity84 as a stick with which to beat it			1
most @entity30 like the @entity25 and are grateful to it and @entity88 for help in overthrowing @entity37			1
but in today 's increasingly lawless @entity30 , they are often powerless to speak up			2
and what does that lawlessness in @entity30 look like ? i found out first hand a few days ago			2
filming a huge fire at @entity30 's foreign ministry , yards from my hotel , we were surrounded by thuggish vigilantes			2
the man with the longest beard , whom they called " @entity104 " , was in charge			0
they had no uniforms or ids and tried to take us away , even wrestling the car keys from the ignition as we tried to drive away			0
for a while it felt like a kidnapping			0
@entity114 : good thing @entity25 terrorist hunters were n't furloughed eventually an educated passer - by stepped in			1
a few hours later my camera was returned by the man i 'd interviewed the night before			0
he controls @entity43 's militias and freed the prime minister from his kidnapping just a few days earlier			2
within sight of my hotel we 'd almost been hauled off and it was a militia , not the government , that had the power to save us			0
that same militia , i later learned , had a representative in an office at our hotel , a young man with a wispy beard called @entity136 , who kept a pump action shotgun under his desk			0
so how does @entity1 's @entity10 trial play in to this mess ? when @entity1 was captured , @entity2 threatened to kidnap @entity25 in @entity30 and target western interests			1
in the east of the country around @entity147 , where @entity2 and the @entity69 are strongest , and where @entity25 ambassador @entity148 was killed last year , security for westerners has deteriorated			1
in the past week the @entity150 consulate in @entity147 has been attacked and @entity152 's diplomat , one of the last in the city , has been forced to leave			0
@entity2 is doing everything it can to use @entity1 's case to leverage support			1
they will be watching his trial intently			0
what do @entity30 think about @entity1 ? most @entity30 i met ca n't understand why @entity25 picked up @entity1 when they did			1
they know just how fragile security is in the country and fear the repercussions			0
most assume his arrest had more to do with @entity25 politics than benefiting @entity30			1
they 've heard what his family has said -- that he was out of @entity2 and living an open life in the capital			2
short of evidence to contrary , they will believe that for now			0
they want him to get a fair trial			0
but if he is guilty they want him punished -- and they certainly do n't want him back if he is still with @entity2			2
they fear the growth of the @entity36 factions and frankly wish @entity25 would do more to help on that count			0
what is @entity2 's game plan ? judging by past performance , @entity2 will try to use @entity1 's trial to convince as many @entity30 as possible that @entity25 is interfering in their country			1
both @entity1 's son and @entity30 's justice minister have said he should have a @entity30 lawyer on his defense team			1
such public pronouncements potentially set themselves up for failure that @entity2 will gleefully exploit			1
@entity2 and its supporters have been establishing training camps in the east of the country for the past two years			2
they want to turn @entity30 into an @entity69 state and have threatened to destroy @entity199 and @entity25 interests in @entity30 as well as develop it as a base for terrorist attacks in @entity199			1
according to one official , such is @entity2 's ease of operations in eastern @entity30 , that hundreds of @entity69 from neighboring north @entity34 nations are gravitating to the area			1
@entity30 is unpredictable ; anyone who tells you they know what will happen is wrong			0
the current trend is towards instability and ultimately a showdown between @entity69 and more moderate factions			0
@entity74 's capture has accelerated that process ; his trial could bring it still closer			0
who are the world 's 10 most dangerous terrorists ?			0

@entity1 , seized in @entity43 and brought to the @entity25 , denies involvement in terrorist bombings of @entity25 embassies
@entity2 has *strengthened* its position in @entity30 since the overthrow of @entity37 , says @entity228
now @entity2 will try to exploit the trial to convince @entity30 that @entity25 is interfering in their country
