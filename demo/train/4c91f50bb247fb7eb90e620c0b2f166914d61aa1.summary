-- the @entity2 cruiser met the disguised @entity4 vessel in the waters off western @entity2 two years after the two became enemies in @entity8 the gun turret of the @entity10 was discovered with the rest of the vessel in march 2008			1
the @entity2 ship approached , trying to determine whether the vessel was friendly			2
what resulted was @entity2 's worst naval disaster : the sinking of the @entity2 ship and the loss of its entire crew of 645			1
the wreckage was n't found until last year , leading to decades of conspiracy theories about what actually happened			0
on wednesday a long - awaited report on the sinking of the @entity10 ended the mystery that began when it met its fate , november 19 , 1941			2
made to look like a cargo ship , the @entity4 vessel was in fact a military raider that fired on the @entity2 when they got close			1
the @entity10 fired back and , in the end , both ships went down			2
more than 300 of the sailors on board the @entity4 vessel , the @entity34 , survived			1
but because they were the only witnesses to the disaster , some doubted their accounts , leading to various theories about the real fate of the @entity10			2
after the wrecks of both ships were located in march 2008 , an @entity2 commission began an inquiry to formally close the book on the loss of the @entity10			1
the results confirm the accounts provided by the @entity4 sailors			0
they said the @entity10 closed in on the @entity34 until it was parallel with the @entity4 ship , little more than 1,000 yards away			1
" @entity10 obviously thought the ship was friendly and was taken by surprise when , after she asked what she believed to be ( a friendly ship ) to give her secret call sign , the response was a number of salvos that destroyed @entity10 's bridge and amidships superstructure and a torpedo strike that crippled the ship and her forward guns , " the report said			1
the @entity10 had given up its tactical advantage of speed and armaments by getting so close to an unknown vessel , the report said			2
while that may have been an error of judgment by the @entity2 captain , @entity76 , the report accepted that other factors -- which may never be known -- influenced his decision			2
" it can never be known what matters were , in fact , operating in capt. @entity76 's mind when he decided to take the @entity10 to the position described			0
nor can it be known what advice , if any , he sought from or was given by other officers on the bridge , " the report says			0
" what is known , however , is that , in trying to identify the sighted ship , capt. @entity76 was performing his duty as a commanding officer			0
" the @entity4 ship inflicted " enormous damage " on the @entity10 during a battle that is believed to have lasted about 35 minutes and left 70 percent of the @entity10 's crew dead or incapacitated , said @entity98			1
@entity99 , the lawyer who presented the evidence gathered by investigators to a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge			0
it is likely that @entity76 , the navigator , and all of the @entity10 's senior officers were taken out on the first salvo , @entity99 said			1
a torpedo tore into the @entity10 's bow , flooding the forward end of the ship , while the @entity34 fired an estimated 87 rounds from its 15 - cm ( 5.9 - inch ) guns into the @entity2 cruiser			1
the @entity10 limped away and sank sometime between 2 hours to 4 1/2 hours later , @entity99 said			0
during the battle , however , the @entity34 itself was hit by an @entity2 shell that damaged its engines and set the vessel ablaze			1
with hundreds of mines aboard , its captain ordered the crew to abandon ship , fearing the fire would set those off			0
charges were set and the ship was scuttled			0
about 80 of the @entity34 's crew of nearly 400 were lost			2
a search began only five days after the battle , when the @entity10 failed to return to port in @entity133			0
and an 11 - day delay by @entity2 's government in announcing the ship 's loss fueled what a 1999 parliamentary report called " a proliferation of theories " about the fate of the crew -- that the ship was actually sunk by a @entity146 submarine , that survivors were machine - gunned in the water or that the government hid bodies after they washed up on the beach			1
the commission thoroughly investigated all the theories and speculations surrounding the disaster and found no substance in any of them , said @entity158 , president of the commission			0
researchers found the @entity10 's wreckage in the @entity162 , about 207 km ( 128 miles ) off @entity2 's west coast			1
the commission was appointed in may 2008 and began its inquiry in january			0
" for a long time our nation has struggled to understand how our greatest maritime disaster occurred			0
the unanswered questions have haunted the families of those brave sailors and airman that never came home , " air chief marshal @entity169 , the chief of the @entity170 , said in a written statement .			0
