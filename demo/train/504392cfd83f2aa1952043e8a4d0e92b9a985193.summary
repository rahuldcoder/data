and a tour with @entity5 , plus plans to finish the long - delayed @entity7 reunion album for release later this year			1
but it has n't come easy for the drummer , who was barely two songs into the making of his new " @entity14 " album when he was seriously injured in a 2008 small plane crash			1
@entity1 and his friend @entity16 were the only survivors			1
" honestly , i never thought the album would be finished , " @entity1 tells @entity0			1
" for a while after my accident , i was just recovering			2
no one really thought i would be able to play drums after all the surgeries and everything			2
that was always on my mind			2
once i was in the studio , it was like , ' i can walk now , i can play the drums still			2
i have to finish this			2

for a time , his left hand was completely numb			2
" it was sketchy , so i came a long way			0
and mentally i was a basket case , " he says			0

" when i look at music everything is blurred , and i like it that way , " @entity1 says of his genre mixing			1
" i grew up like that , hanging out with different types of people who listened to so many different types of music			0
i never wanted to be part of any one clique			0
" @entity7 began work on a new album in late 2009 , but for most of the last year the band had other things to do			2
