-- @entity1 says studying " @entity3 " is changing her life for the better			1
the 2006 book and film discusses the law of attraction , something adherents say allows people to attract what they want by envisioning it and believing it will come			2
@entity1 says she 's used it to kick - start a business idea : attaching decorated tabs to credit cards so people can easily pull the cards from wallets			1
thanks to " @entity3 , " she says , she 's attracted people and resources to help her and already is selling the tabs in 10 local stores			1
" nothing has been the same since i 've listened to the @entity26 [ of the book ] , " said @entity1 , 29			2
" i can control how my day goes			0
" so the @entity30 , @entity29 - area insurance agent bristles when she hears people using the troubles of self - help entrepreneur @entity33 , who appears in but did not create " @entity3 " film , to bash the attraction principles			1
@entity33 integrates the law of attraction into his teachings on obtaining spiritual , financial , mental and physical wealth			0
he postponed all his scheduled events through the end of the year after three people died after spending time in a sweat lodge session he led near @entity44 , @entity45 , in october			0
police are investigating the deaths , and @entity33 has said his organization is working with authorities to determine what happened ; no charges have been filed			0
" it works with or without him , " @entity1 said of the book and film -- both works of @entity56 tv producer @entity55			1
" [ @entity33 is ] just an advocate			0
" self - help is a multibillion - dollar - a - year unregulated industry in the @entity60 , according to @entity61 , professor of psychology at the @entity63			1
@entity61 says hundreds of quality , research - supported self - help programs on career growth , health and self - esteem exist			1
but he and other critics say some gurus , promising secrets to greater happiness and wealth , offer advice that at best is n't proven effective and at worst could send someone down a poorly suited or dangerous path			1
" you can publish anything making the most outrageous claims as long as it 's not libelous , " said @entity61 , co-author of " @entity77 to @entity78 in @entity79			0
" @entity84 takes particular umbrage at @entity33 and law of attraction advocates , saying they generally offer anecdotal evidence that their way works , but do n't offer scientific evidence to support the claims			1
@entity33 , who has written books and holds seminars and other events , says on his web site that he blends " the practical and mystical into a usable and easy - to - access formula for achieving true wealth across all aspects of life			1
" his six - step journey of @entity102 of events costs participants thousands of dollars			1
one of the steps , the @entity107 retreat , which was under way when the october sweat lodge deaths happened , costs $ 9,695 per person			0
" when people are pursuing a program of undocumented effectiveness , they are not spending time and money pursuing a program they know works , " @entity61 said			1
a media representative for @entity33 declined to comment about the criticism			0
@entity121 , who has attended several of @entity33 's programs , says @entity33 's techniques have helped him break habits and thoughts that hindered him and have given him tools to achieve goals " in a more elegant and rapid manner			2
" the 33 - year - old technology - company program manager from @entity131 , @entity132 , says @entity33 's and other self - help programs helped him get his professional certification in project management			1
@entity121 , who was n't at the event near @entity44 , says the deaths were tragic and unacceptable			2
but he says he is n't turned off to the self - help industry or @entity33 's teachings , and he may be interested in attending another @entity33 event in the future			1
" the results in my own life , that 's what i 'd trust more than a third - party study , " @entity121 said			1
" my [ project management ] certificate is hanging on the wall right now			0
it 's not just a dream			0
" psychologists : how to choose several people trained in psychology , however , told @entity0 that too many self - help authors and presenters offer little scientific evidence that backs up their claims			1
@entity160 , a clinical psychologist in @entity161 , @entity162 , says he believes more self - help books should undergo pre-publication testing -- especially those written by psychologists , who he says should be held to a high professional standard			1
" when you look at a book for depression , there probably is n't a blurb on the back that says this book has been shown in studies to help 65 percent of those who have been diagnosed with this			2
there 's just a claim that this can happen for you , " said @entity160 , a former chairman of the @entity181 's task force on self - help therapies			2
@entity61 says that a lack of scientific evidence is n't the only thing to look out for			2
other characteristics that should make consumers wary , he says : authors or speakers who do n't have formal training in the featured topic			1
" they should look for someone with rigorous training at an accredited university and who has spent years investigating and conducting these treatments , " @entity61 said			2
programs that do n't screen consumers for problems			1
for example , @entity61 says , certain programs might be harmful for a person with bipolar disorder			2
people who reject conventional knowledge and instead imply a revolutionary secret			0
" it 's marketing , essentially , " @entity61 said			0
people who propose solutions for all problems instead of particular problems			0
@entity216 , executive director of the @entity217 , said consumers should be wary of programs that cost a lot of money but teach no hands - on skills			1
" it 's one thing to pay a trade school			0
it 's another to pay the same kind of money to ... seek a mystical effect on your prosperity , " said @entity216 , who holds a master 's degree in experimental psychology and a doctorate in the history of science			0
he also warns that the effects can be fleeting			0
" @entity240 has wasted millions " on motivational seminars , @entity216 said			0
" the marketing and sales guys get fired up , but the effects of those types of seminars are weeks at minimum , months at best			0
that 's why a lot of them do corporate retreats every six months , because the effects fade			0
" @entity216 suggests that consumers try out a self - help adviser 's book or tape before committing to an expensive getaway " to see if there 's a connection for you			2
" people interested in a program also should talk to previous participants at least six months after they used it , he said			0
" if you talked a day after , they would have to rationalize it to a certain extent [ even if it were no good ] because they just paid a lot of money , " @entity216 said			0
as for @entity1 , she says the changes in her life are all the proof she needs that " @entity3 " is working			1
" i 'm sure there are people who need [ scientific evidence ] , fine			0
then find something that works for you , " she said .			2

some programs do n't screen for conditions that might make someone ill - suited , expert says
