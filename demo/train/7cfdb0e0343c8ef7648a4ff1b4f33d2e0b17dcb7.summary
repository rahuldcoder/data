-- experts are putting forward all sorts of reasons @entity4 recently became more obese than the @entity5 -- and one of the most overweight countries in the world			1
poverty , tacos , urbanization , soda			0
those are the widely discussed culprits			0
and they , along with the choices people in @entity4 make , are no doubt part of the story			2
but there 's an uberfactor here : @entity4 's neighbor to the north			1
could one reason for @entity4 's growing , deadly obesity problem be that the country is unfortunate enough to share a border with the @entity5 -- land of the @entity28 , home of diabetes ? i started thinking about that issue after seeing news bounce all over the internet that nearly a third of @entity4 now are obese , compared with 31.8 % of @entity5 , according to a recent report from the @entity37			1
maybe @entity5 trends such as fast food , fried food and soda drifted south			1
it reminded me of a smart @entity44 story i read in april			0
" perhaps for @entity4 , the biggest problem is living next door to the @entity5 , which means the fast food and super-sized culture has a particularly strong influence , " the @entity46 magazine wrote			1
" so do the @entity5 food and drink giants who sell vast quantities south of the border and have already proved adept at fending off sin taxes and other forms of anti-obesity regulation in the @entity5			1
" i called up dr. @entity60 , director of the research center on nutrition and health at @entity4 's @entity64 , to see what he thought of this theory			1
@entity60 did n't blame the @entity5 , but he did blame " sugary beverages , " which the @entity5 produces and markets			1
@entity4 's soda - and - sugar - water consumption numbers are staggering			1
the average @entity4 drinks 163 liters of sugary beverages per year , @entity60 said , which tops the world			2
that 's almost nine cans of soda per week			2
a rising middle class as well as the prevalence of greasy street food , including tacos and quesadillas , also accounts for much of the problem , said @entity83 , an associate at the @entity85 's @entity84			2
but @entity4 's rich neighbor also plays a role in ( here 's the crucial part ) shaping the country 's tastes , he said			1
" potato chips are very popular , as is drinking lots of soft drinks , " @entity83 said			0
" but we see similar trends not only related to food and junk food but , at a broader level , commercial tests in @entity4 are fairly closely linked to tastes in the @entity5 and that 's because of the intensity of cultural interactions " between the countries			1
this influence applies to other countries , too , of course			0
according to the @entity37 report , 1.4 billion ( yes , billion ! ) people worldwide are overweight and 500 million are obese			0
the fast - food - ization of the world , and the health problems that have followed , started with @entity5 and have spread far and wide			1
at a certain point , though , does it matter where the problem started ? @entity60 , the public health official in @entity4 , was quick to claim obesity as a problem @entity4 has to own -- regardless of its origins			0
" i think there is more influence of the fast food industry ( and ) the sugary beverages in @entity4 than in other countries as a result of being neighbors to the @entity5 , " he said			1
" ... but i think that globalization is such now that you see very , very similar things in many other countries , even in countries that are less developed			0
so i would not blame too much on the @entity5 the problem is ours , and we have to solve the problem			2
" some important steps already are being taken			0
@entity4 banned soda in schools , @entity60 said , and might soon propose new programs to combat obesity			2
@entity4 's close relationship with the @entity5 , however , means that @entity5 and its corporate proxies should share the responsibility of implementing solutions			1
" let me remind you , " dr. @entity146 , director - general of the @entity147 , said in a june speech at a conference in @entity150			0
" not one single country has managed to turn around its obesity epidemic in all age groups			0
this is not a failure of individual willpower			0
this is a failure of political will to take on big business			0
" it does matter where these deadly trend originated -- and who started them			0
the least the @entity5 could do is be a better neighbor			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity172 report says @entity4 is now more obese than the @entity5
@entity174 : maybe we should blame @entity4 's northern neighbor
he says @entity5 trends like fast food and sugary soda have drifted south
@entity169 : " the least the @entity5 could do is be a better neighbor "
