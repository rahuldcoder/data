-- @entity3 's tumultuous @entity2 campaign ended in dismal fashion on tuesday as the former world champions were beaten 2 - 1 by hosts @entity6 in their final group game in @entity9			1
both @entity11 goals came in the first half while @entity14 midfielder @entity13 was sent off following a clash with @entity16 to deal another early blow to @entity3 's slim hopes			2
@entity3 's nightmare ends but @entity6 fall short @entity14 preparations for the match had been overshadowed by an apparent collapse in relations between coach @entity24 and his players , with captain @entity26 left out of the side after apparently clashing with @entity24 and other coaching staff and officials			1
@entity6 's win was not enough to prevent them becoming the first @entity2 host nation to be eliminated before the tournament 's knockout stages , with @entity35 advancing alongside group winners @entity37 despite losing 1 - 0 to the @entity38			1
but the real misery was for @entity14 fans who saw their team -- traditionally among the strongest national sides in world football -- become one of the first to be eliminated from the @entity2 amid turbulent infighting and allegations of treachery			0
the 10 biggest @entity2 upsets striker @entity49 was sent home after confronting @entity24 at halftime during @entity3 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity35 last week			1
@entity26 was then involved in a public training ground dispute with the squad 's fitness coach on sunday and is reported to have led dissent over @entity49 's expulsion from the squad , with the entire squad boycotting the training session			2
adding to the confusion , @entity14 team director @entity61 then publicly announced his resignation to the media , while @entity14 sports minister @entity65 has been in @entity3 attempting to mediate between @entity24 and his players			1
but on monday night @entity65 told journalists the @entity14 players had " tarnished the image of @entity3 , " according to @entity14 sports newspaper @entity68			2
in an indication of the extent to which relations had broken down between @entity24 and his squad , the coach on monday described this players ' decision to strike as " unspeakably stupid , " and called their actions " an aberration and an imbecility			1
" @entity81 : heads should roll for @entity14 farce " nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high - level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football , " @entity24 told reporters			2
" we tried to convince the players that what was happening was irregular , that their actions were unspeakably stupid			1
i told myself this masquerade had to be stopped			0
no way would i back this action			0
" @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity97 in @entity98 said @entity14 fans , pundits and politicians were attempting to outdo each other in their criticism of the @entity14 squad			0
" one of the words we 've heard is divas to describe the team and chaos to describe the situation , " said @entity97			0
" it 's the image of the @entity14 society now , it 's a bad example for the youth -- terrible , " one @entity98 woman told @entity0			0
" they 're paid players			0
whatever happened in their team it 's not the right time to go on strike , " said another			0
@entity3 's problems at the @entity2 had exacerbated long - standing dissatisfaction with the controversial @entity24 , who is due to step down as national coach after the tournament to make way for former @entity2 - winning defender @entity127			1
@entity3 won the @entity2 on home soil in 1998 and reached the final under @entity24 four years ago in @entity130 , losing on penalties to @entity132 after star player @entity133 was sent off for head butting @entity136 defender @entity135			1
but @entity3 has struggled to replace the @entity133 generation , which also won the @entity138 in 2000			0
they only qualified for @entity6 by virtue of a tight playoff win over @entity142 , sealed with the help of @entity144 's handballed assist for @entity146 ' goal			0
exit at the group stage in @entity6 marks their second successive failure in the opening stages of a major tournament after they crashed out of @entity153 without winning a match .			2
