-- in 2011 , @entity1 considered food to be her enemy			1
having been tormented by schoolmates for being overweight since she was 7 , she decided to fight back the only way she knew how			2
at the beginning of her senior year of high school , at a size 18 , @entity6 began compulsively dieting and exercising			1
by the time she started college the following year , she was down to a size 4 and was obsessed with losing weight			1
" our society and my peers told me that i was n't loveable when i was fat			2
that when i was fat , i could n't be anything else , " said @entity6 , now a senior and a biology major at @entity20 in @entity21			2
" so , i was determined to be the farthest thing from fat possible			2
" she began what she called a war against calories , and it quickly spiraled out of control			0
she limited herself to 400 to 600 calories and did 90 minutes of intense cardio daily			0
yet at her lightest , @entity6 never dropped below a size 4			1
" just because my bone structure stopped me from being the size 00 everyone pictures , does n't mean that i was n't in an incredibly unsafe and unhealthy place , " she said			1
although she was 15 pounds underweight , no one caught onto her habits because they were too busy praising her for her weight loss			0
" we constantly push people to lose weight , but sometimes that 's not right for everyone , " @entity6 said			0
in the @entity46 , some 20 million women and another 10 million men suffer from a clinical eating disorder , such as anorexia or bulimia , according to the @entity50			1
many people also struggle with some form of body dissatisfaction or unhealthy eating behaviors that can lead to the development of clinical disorders			1
studies suggest half a million teens are suffering from eating disorders , and that their concerns about weight begin as young as 6			1
going to extremes : eating disorders in @entity46 @entity6 says she did n't treat her body like she loved it when she began to lose weight			1
" i deprived it , punished it and tortured it , " @entity6 said			0
" i was convinced that a smaller dress size was the key to happiness			1
" breaking the cycle the day after @entity6 moved into her college dorm , she said hello to a girl down the hall who was moving in with the help of her family			0
her hall mate 's sister noticed that @entity6 was unnaturally thin			0
a recovering bulimic who was studying to be an eating disorder psychiatrist , the sister had a feeling about @entity6 and asked the hall mate to keep an eye on her			1
after only a few months , the hall mate realized that @entity6 was n't in a good place , mentally or physically			0
her restrictive diet and obsessive exercise was obvious , so she confronted @entity6 on the issue , finally allowing her to get it all out			0
" the thing about eating disorders is that you realize you have one			1
you do n't need someone to tell you that you 're sick , " @entity6 said			0
" what i needed was someone to understand and to help me understand that weight gain was ok			0
" the process was slow and difficult			0
she spent the first six months convincing herself that things such as pizza and chocolate were ok -- that eating them would n't be the end of the world			1
over time , she began to exercise less , eat more and reshape her attitudes toward food and her body			1
" during recovery , you realize that you have to make a choice , " @entity6 said			1
" you can choose to try and fit some predetermined mold , or you can focus on being the happiest and healthiest , both mentally and physically , version of yourself			0
" while @entity6 said starting her recovery was the hardest thing she 's done , she also knows it was necessary to get her life back			1
she found support in an online community , a judgment - free zone where she could voice her fears			1
@entity6 says that the people she communicated with were n't experts but real people who had been where she was and could share their own experiences			0
she 's gained 60 pounds since she began recovery and has maintained her weight for 15 months now			2
currently wearing between a size 10 and 14 , she says the most important part is that she 's happy and her body seems to " like to be this weight			1
" " at the end of the day , weight does n't even really matter in an eating disorder because it 's a mental disease , " @entity6 said			1
" yes , there 's a physical manifestation of this mental illness , but it 's not a problem that stems from your physical health			1
" a complex illness many people with eating disorders do n't look like they have one , said @entity150 of the @entity50			2
it 's important to remember that there 's no universal picture of how anorexia or bulimia manifests itself physically , she says , and that a person can be struggling mentally without looking " sick			0
" " eating disorders are complex illnesses with complex roots , " she said			2
" there 's a strong cultural influence to be thin , and many people are vulnerable to that			0
" most people ca n't overcome an eating disorder on their own and need professional help			1
on its website , the association offers several options to find help , such as phone support , live chats with counselors and referrals for treatment and support groups			0
there 's a link between issues such as depression or anxiety and eating disorders , @entity150 said			2
the media and popular culture often push the message that thinness is the solution to any and all problems , she said , and a person suffering from depression can be easily influenced by that			0
@entity150 oversees @entity194 , a site working in conjunction with her eating association that was formed in 2011 in response to the increasing use of the @entity200 to promote eating disorders and unrealistic body images			1
" there 's a proliferation of messages on social media and a steady stream of images that promote weight loss , " @entity150 said			0
" but we 're also seeing an increase in online communities that have positive messages and offer support to those suffering from eating disorders			1
" for more fitspiration , subscribe to our @entity218 magazine another upside to social media is that users have the ability to curate their own feeds , choosing the people and groups that they want to appear in their news feed			0
for someone in recovery or struggling with an eating disorder , the ability to " turn off " the negative pictures and messages can be a big step in the right direction , @entity150 said			1
" there 's no straight line to recovery , " she said			2
however , the first step is reaching a place where they want help and seeking that support from friends , family or through a doctor or counselor			0
paying it forward @entity6 now hosts a site on @entity248 that encourages people to embrace their bodies and reminds them that eating disorders do n't manifest themselves in a certain appearance			2
she said beginning her own blog was her way of supporting other people in her situation , especially those who recover to be plus - sized			0
she no longer sees food as her nemesis and eats what makes her happy , not letting calories control the choices she makes			0
she 's proud that she 's experienced foods that she would n't have dared to eat during her illness			0
" people who do n't know me look at me now and see a ' before ' photo			0
little do they know that i 'm an ' after ' photo over 14 years in the making			2
" now 21 and loving her body , she 's no longer the insecure 7 - year - old who was bullied at school			1
" i believe that body positivity is for everyone			2
there is no weight limit or fitness test in order to be happy with yourself			0

never a size 0 , @entity1 says her eating disorder went *unnoticed* for years
her recovery involved both mental and physical changes
now she tells online followers that loving your body is the key to happiness
