the @entity0 has ruled criminal suspects can be subjected to a police dna test after arrest -- before trial and conviction -- a privacy - versus - public - safety dispute that could have wide - reaching implications in the rapidly evolving technology surrounding criminal procedure			1
at issue in the ruling monday was whether taking genetic samples from someone held without a warrant in criminal custody for " a serious offense " is an unconstitutional " search			1
" a 5 - 4 majority of the court concluded it is legitimate , and upheld a state law			1
" when officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody , taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee 's dna is , like fingerprinting and photographing , a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the @entity36 , " the majority wrote			1
read the court 's ruling law enforcement lauds genetic testing 's potential as the " gold standard " of reliable evidence gathering , especially to solve " cold cases " involving violent offenders			1
but privacy rights groups counter the state 's " trust us " promise not to abuse the technology does not ease their concerns that someone 's biological makeup could soon be applied for a variety of non-criminal purposes			1
twenty - six states and the federal government allow genetic swabs to be taken after a felony arrest and without a warrant			1
each has different procedures , but in all cases , only a profile is created			0
about 13 individual markers out of some 3 billion are isolated from a suspect 's dna			1
that selective information does not reveal the full genetic makeup of a person and , officials stress , nothing is shared with any other public or private party , including any medical diagnostics			0
the @entity75 administration has signaled its support			0
read a summary of major upcoming decisions the case involves a @entity81 man convicted of a 2003 rape in @entity83 in the state 's @entity84			0
@entity86 had been arrested four years ago on an unrelated assault charge , and a biological sample was automatically obtained at that time			2
that sample was linked to the earlier sexual assault			2
@entity86 moved to suppress that evidence on @entity36 grounds , but was ultimately convicted of the 2003 first - degree rape offense and was given a life sentence			2
the @entity36 grants the " right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures			0
" both @entity86 and his legal team turned down @entity104 's request for an interview			0
a divided @entity106 later agreed with @entity86 , saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon , outweighing the state 's law enforcement interests			0
that court also said obtaining @entity86 's dna immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him , and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting			1
but the high court decided in favor of the state			1
@entity121 was joined by chief justice @entity122 , and justices @entity123 , @entity125 , and @entity126			2
the issue of citizen privacy has been particularly acute since the 9/11 attacks			0
federal and state governments have stepped up surveillance of suspected terrorists and their allies and of high - risk targets , like government buildings and shopping malls			1
the current conservative - majority court has generally been supportive of law enforcement in recent search and privacy disputes , but not always			1
the court last year ruled police could not place a gps tracking device on a drug suspect 's car for several weeks without first obtaining a search warrant			2
in a sharply worded dissent , justice @entity148 said the majority 's reasoning established a " terrifying principle			1
" " the court 's opinion barely mentions the crucial fact about this case : the search here was entirely suspicionless			2
the police had no reason to believe @entity86 's dna would link him to any crime			2
" @entity148 added the state law " manages to burden uniquely the sole group for whom the @entity36 's protections ought to be most jealously guarded : people who are innocent of the state 's accusations , " describing of the legal concept of innocent until proven guilty			1
he was supported by justices @entity171 , @entity173 , and @entity174			0
@entity148 's prior support of @entity36 protections is well - documented , so his siding with three more liberal members of the court was not surprising			1
a 1994 federal law created a national database in which local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies can compare and share information on dna matches from convicted felons , but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed			2
in a brief filed by 49 states supporting @entity81 , officials also said the information is secure , and retested when an initial " hit " is identified			0
after a warrant is issued for probable cause , another fresh dna sample is taken and it is that test that is used to ultimately prosecute in court			1
each initial test costs about $ 30			0
the @entity36 requires the government to balance legitimate law enforcement interests with the privacy rights of individuals			0
a key area of concern in the high court was whether developing " @entity208 " technology would allow initial identification testing to be completed within about two hours			1
currently it can take two weeks or more , depending on backlogs			0
civil liberties groups worry inadequate testing by overwhelmed lab technicians can lead to errors , such as the one that sent @entity218 to prison for armed robbery			1
it was three years before a lab mistake was noticed , and the @entity224 man was freed as an innocent man			2
@entity208 -- @entity227 acid -- is a coded molecule providing a genetic map for the development of all known living organisms			0
by 2000 , all 50 states and the federal government required dna collection from convicted offenders , and that was soon expanded by many jurisdiction to criminal arrests			2
the number of offender profiles in federal @entity241 is now about 10 million , with more than a million arrestee profiles			0
@entity243 in december passed the @entity244 , a grant program to help states pay for the expanded system			0
the 22 - year - old woman was murdered in 2003 , but her killer was not identified until three years later , after his conviction for another crime , when his dna matched cold - case evidence found under the victim 's fingernails			1
her mother , @entity254 , personally lobbied lawmakers for months to ensure passage			0
president @entity75 signed the bill earlier this year			0
" it 's the right thing to do , " he said in 2010 , of expanding dna swabs for arrestees			0
" this is where the national registry becomes so important			0
" the case is @entity81 v. @entity86 ( 12 - 207 )			0
scenarios , terminology key in prepping for same - sex court ruling			1

in a 5 - 4 decision , the high court likens taking a dna sample to fingerprinting an arrestee
in dissent , justice @entity148 says the ruling establishes a " terrifying principle "
civil liberties groups worry about errors by overwhelmed lab technicians
