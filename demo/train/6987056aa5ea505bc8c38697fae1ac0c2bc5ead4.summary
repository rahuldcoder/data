-- it has been over three years since we last saw @entity3 on the silver screen in 2008 ′ s " @entity5			2
" regardless of the profession , three years is a long break			0
but in the movie industry , it can be an eternity			0
so it was only natural for many to wonder whether @entity3 's previous box - office dominance would waver at all when " @entity14 " hit theaters last weekend			1
could the movie star pick up where he left off in 2008 and continue selling a gazillion tickets as though his sabbatical simply never occurred ? well , sort of			0
" @entity14 " opened to $ 54.6 million last weekend ( or $ 69.3 million if you include @entity20 )			1
while that 's slightly better than the debuts of 1997 ′ s " @entity24 " ( $ 51.1 million ) and 2002 ′ s " @entity25 " ( $ 52.1 million ) , " @entity14 " actually sold far fewer tickets			1
if you adjust for ticket - price inflation , then " @entity24 " and " @entity25 " opened to $ 88.2 million and $ 71.2 million , respectively			2
the legacy of ' men ' in black furthermore , the first two " @entity14 " movies debuted on wednesdays and would have scored even larger figures had they been held until friday , like " @entity14 " was			0
and " @entity14 " was the series ' only entry to benefit from @entity35 surcharges			0
so " @entity14 's " performance was actually something of a disappointment , especially when considering its gargantuan $ 230 million budget			1
but to what extent , if any , is @entity3 to blame here ? after all , we 're talking about a threequel that was released a decade after the last installment -- and " @entity25 " was a very poorly received installment to boot			0
even if @entity3 had continued acting these past three years , it would probably be unreasonable to expect " @entity14 " to perform significantly better than it did			1
also , according to the market - research firm @entity50 , 50 percent of moviegoers listed @entity3 as their reason for buying a ticket to " @entity14			2
" so the actor was still the main drawing factor for the film			0
take a look at @entity3 's five last features : " @entity5 , " " @entity59 , " " @entity60 , " " @entity56 , " and " hitch			1
" yes , " @entity14 " failed to compete with the likes of " @entity59 " ( $ 62.6 million debut ) and " @entity60 " ( $ 77.2 million )			2
but if you averaged the openings of all five films , it 'd come out to $ 45 million -- or $ 52 million when adjusted for ticket - price inflation			1
in that light , " @entity24 3 's " $ 54.6 million debut is n't so disheartening			1
disappointing for such a pricey sci - fi action franchise ? sure			0
but a stain on @entity3 's box - office report card ? not really			1
the real test for @entity3 will be his next film , the @entity75 sci - fi thriller " after @entity76 , " which will costar the actor 's son , @entity77			2
it 's an original project , so franchise fatigue wo n't be a viable excuse this time			0
and it wo n't be released for another year ( june 7 , 2013 )			0
but while we wait , it 's nice to see a movie star of @entity3 's caliber back on the big screen -- even if his star is shining a tiny bit less brightly than it used to			1

@entity3 has been a big money maker for @entity98
" @entity14 " opened to $ 54.6 million last weekend
if you averaged the openings of @entity3 's last five films , it 'd come out to $ 45 million
