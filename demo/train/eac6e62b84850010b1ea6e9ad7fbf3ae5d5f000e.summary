-- @entity1 took a colorful turn this week , when its female users began posting cryptic status updates			0
" beige , " " sexy black and gold , " " crimson red , " " turquoise , " " nude with a lot of padding , " read some			0
the color scheme has left male users scratching their heads and asking " huh ? " so , what is behind the trend ? it 's all part of an effort to raise awareness for breast cancer by asking women to post the color of the bra they 're wearing			1
female @entity24 started catching on this week as a message made its rounds through the inboxes of the social media network			0
" we are playing a game for @entity32 , " one form of the message read			0
" write the color of your bra as your status -- just the color , nothing else ! ! copy this and pass it on to all girls -- no men ! ! this will be fun to see how it spreads			1
" by friday , all the colors of the @entity45 rainbow were present in users ' news feeds when they logged in			0
a spokeswoman for @entity1 said it 's not clear where or how the message started , calling it an example of a grass - roots movement beginning on the social networking site			1
" what is particularly unique about this grass - roots campaign is that it seems to have been started by a user or group of users , as opposed to an official entity , and spread virally throughout @entity1 , " @entity1 's @entity56 said			1
" it 's an ideal example of how an individual voice can be magnified to create awareness for a good cause and ignite action among millions by using a site like @entity1			2
" breast cancer groups say they are happy that the disease , which affects more than 200,000 women in the @entity72 a year , is getting attention			2
" it 's not one of our campaigns , but we 're all for it , " said @entity74 , a spokeswoman for @entity75 for the @entity76			1
" just about anything that raises this issue in a positive , fun way is just terrific			0
" @entity56 said hundreds , if not thousands , of users were posting their color choices directly to the @entity75 and @entity1 pages			2
@entity74 encouraged women to take the trend one step further by visiting the @entity75 web site and getting more information about ways to raise awareness			1
meanwhile , some tech blogs were calling the color string the new " @entity98 , " a meme -- @entity99 speak for a concept or catchphrase that spreads quickly on the @entity102 -- that went viral in early 2009			1
users were asked to post notes with random tidbits about themselves and then " tag " other users to do the same			2
the " @entity98 " note was virtually unavoidable for a three - week period as users passed it on , sort of like a modern - day chain letter			0
it 's unclear whether the color meme will have the same popularity if half of @entity1 's 350 million active users ca n't participate .			0
