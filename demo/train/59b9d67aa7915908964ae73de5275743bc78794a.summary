-- controversy continues to swirl around the comments made by @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity6 candidate , that " legitimate rape " would only rarely lead to pregnancy			1
initially , the media focused on the fallout of his remarks concerning issues of abortion , sexual violence and the effect on women voters			0
while @entity3 has vigorously recanted his remarks , and both @entity19 and president @entity20 have lambasted his statements , only more recently has attention been paid to the fact that @entity3 sits on the @entity24			1
the @entity26 's petition for speaker of the house @entity27 to remove @entity3 , a @entity29 , from the @entity28 science committee is just starting to gain momentum , and well it should			1
the @entity28 science committee has oversight on congressional science and technology policy and thereby helps shape the course of billions of dollars of related funding			1
in other words , @entity3 -- who is now best known for his folkloric views on reproduction -- has a strong say in determining the long - term scientific progress of our country			1
news : @entity3 imbroglio is bad news for republicans how can a science and technology leader like the @entity48 allow itself to be governed by people who try to ignore scientific fact ? given @entity3 's " magical " theories regarding rape , abortion and pregnancy , i would not want him having a say in the long - term plans of a single middle - school science class , much less our nation as a whole			1
how do we let him get away with this ? and make no mistake : we are likely to let him get away with this			0
@entity3 's apologize - and - move - on method is quite effective in politics today			1
in politics , the woeful reality is that folklore often trumps real science			1
opinion : rape can make you pregnant			0
the situation with @entity3 is not an isolated one			2
the dynamics of politics over science ( and emotions over data ) are widespread in our government today			2
for much of the past year , political forces in @entity85 have pushed to " overturn science " by seeking to overturn the @entity87 finding			2
in that case , the @entity87 had used what it deemed to be the best - available scientific data to conclude that greenhouse gases were a pollutant and a danger to public health , and in response ( following standing government policies ) it issued an emissions rule for cars and some trucks , only to encounter political hurdles questioning the data			0
if you want to have an argument over how government policy should or should n't be applied to climate change issues , that is fair			0
if you want to fund further data collection ( by reputable entities ) to add to our understanding of climate phenomena , that too is reasonable			0
what is not reasonable is to discredit years of scientific data without any scientific basis for doing so and to ask for a do - over			0
such data takes years to collect after all , and should not be used as a stalling tactic			0
news : ' legitimate rape ' reaction goes global the recurring theme in these stories is that when data goes against a politician 's belief or hope , they try to refute the data and the science -- sometimes supplying their own folklore as stand - ins for real data -- rather than taking on the higher - level and more complex policy issues regarding how to respond to the data			2
further examples are also easy to find , including @entity137 's pseudo-scientific statement regarding vaccine side effects			0
as experimental scientists , my colleagues and i are often faced with situations where we hoped our experiments would yield data that neatly agree with our hypothesis , but when we actually run the experiment , we see the data indicates something either subtly or dramatically different			0
what do we do ? rerunning the experiment is , of course , a natural step			0
but eventually , if substantial data points to a hypothesis different than ours , we need to adjust our thinking , adjust our hypotheses , and accept what the data is showing us			0
news : @entity3 takes on ' party bosses , ' insists he ' can win this race ' where does this leave us regarding @entity3 and the @entity28 science committee ? one of my key roles as a thesis research adviser is to help guide undergraduate and graduate students to accept the realities of experimental science , and to think hard about what their gathered data is telling us , rather than to wish for different data			1
increasingly , i see that one of my key roles as a @entity48 citizen is to guide our politicians along a similar path : rep. @entity3 and his cohort can not be allowed to substitute folklore for science , and it is our responsibility to stop them			1
most notably , those who choose not to distinguish between folklore and science should not be on the @entity28 science committee			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity197 rep. @entity3 sits on the @entity24 , @entity198 and technology
@entity194 : a petition to remove him from the committee is starting to gain momentum
@entity3 and his cohort can not be allowed to substitute folklore for science , she says
@entity194 : how can the @entity48 allow itself to be governed by those who ignore scientific fact ?
