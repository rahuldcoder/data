@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity4 's strategy for the @entity1 crisis reflects his internationalist foreign policy while adhering to the age - old maxim that money talks			1
he sent secretary of state @entity9 to @entity0 on tuesday to forcefully condemn @entity10 for seizing effective military control of the @entity13 region			1
at the same time , @entity9 announced $ 1 billion in loan guarantees to help insulate the @entity1 economy from the effects of reduced energy subsidies from @entity10			1
it all is part of the still simmering breakup of the old @entity20 more than two decades ago , with @entity10 president @entity21 seeking to maintain @entity10 's influence and economic ties in a region being wooed by the @entity25 and @entity26 for increased trade and other links			0
on tuesday , both @entity4 and @entity9 warned @entity21 of possible international sanctions and other steps to isolate @entity10 diplomatically and economically if he escalates the @entity1 crisis by sending in more troops			1
the goal of such an approach would be to hit @entity21 where it hurts by weakening the ruble and @entity10 's economy while avoiding the possibility of igniting an already volatile crisis to a new level of confrontation and possible violence			0
isolation , not confrontation , is the goal " it is diplomacy and respect for sovereignty , not unilateral force , that can best solve disputes like this in the 21st century , " @entity9 told reporters to wrap up his one - day stop in @entity1 's capital			2
" president @entity4 and i want to make it clear to @entity10 and to everybody in the world that we are not seeking confrontation			1
" however , he continued , " if @entity10 does not choose to de-escalate , if it is not willing to work directly with the government of @entity1 , as we hope they will be , then our partners will have absolutely no choice but to join us to continue to expand upon steps we have taken in recent days in order to isolate @entity10 politically , diplomatically and economically			1
" what are @entity71 options ? one possible move , hinted at by @entity9 , would be to kick @entity10 out of the @entity74 group of industrial powers that also includes the @entity71 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
those nations already are skipping a preparatory meeting for the next @entity84 set to be hosted by @entity21 in june in @entity85			0
" it is not appropriate to invade a country and , at the end of a barrel of a gun , dictate what you are trying to achieve , " @entity9 said			0
" that is not 21st century @entity74 , major nation behavior			0
" the @entity71 " will stand by the @entity1 people , " he said after accusing @entity10 of making up reasons for further military intervention in @entity1 based on alleged persecution of @entity10 speakers and native @entity10			1
" not a single piece of credible evidence supports any one of these claims , " he said , adding that it was clear " that @entity10 has been working hard to create a pretext to invade further			1
" told by a reporter that @entity21 had earlier indicated no @entity10 troops were in @entity13 , @entity9 shook his head with disbelief and asked : " he really denied there were troops in @entity13 ? " @entity21 decision near ? a @entity71 official familiar with the latest administration assessment said tuesday that national security agencies believe @entity21 will decide in the next few days whether to send more troops into @entity1			1
according to the official , the diplomatic pressure by @entity4 and @entity9 sought to influence @entity21 's decision			2
in remarks tuesday , @entity4 said @entity21 realized that the @entity71 and its @entity121 allies consider the @entity10 military buildup in @entity1 a violation of international law			1
" there have been some reports that president @entity21 is pausing for a moment and reflecting on what 's happened , " @entity4 said			0
" i know president @entity21 seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations but i do n't think that 's fooling anybody , " @entity4 continued			0
" i think everybody recognizes that although @entity10 has legitimate interests in what happens in a neighboring state , that does not give it the right to use force as a means of exerting influence inside of that state			0
" @entity71 moving fast on possible sanctions in another sign of increasing pressure on @entity21 , a @entity148 government statement tuesday quoted president @entity151 as calling for a diplomatic solution			2
" the situation is highly complicated and sensitive , affecting both regional and entire global situations , " said the statement attributed to @entity151 " i believe @entity10 can coordinate with all sides , use political means to resolve the issue , and maintain peace and stability for the region and the world			0
@entity148 supports conciliatory measures from the international community that help mitigate the situation			0
" critics want a more robust @entity71 response no one calls for a @entity71 military response in @entity1 , and polls show strong public opposition to the @entity71 assuming the role of global policeman by taking the lead in international conflicts			2
during his presidency , @entity4 has sought a more international approach to crises , as exemplified by the @entity180 coalition that imposed a " no - fly " zone on @entity182 with logistical help from the @entity71			2
however , his inability to build an international coalition to attack @entity186 for its use of chemical weapons resulted in criticism that @entity4 failed to fulfill his earlier threat to act			0
hawkish @entity71 politicians want a more robust response by the @entity4 administration to the @entity10 aggression , calling for tough economic sanctions and reviving plans to build a missile - defense shield in @entity198 that @entity21 opposed			1
@entity199 rep. @entity199 of @entity200 , the chairman of the @entity201 , called for pursuing aggressive sanctions that would undermine the ruble and @entity10 's state - owned banks			0
" we should do it , frankly , " he told @entity2 , but adding that @entity10 should be offered an " exit ramp " out of the crisis through negotiations			0
@entity209 , an international security analyst with the @entity210 , told @entity2 that any sanctions must be in concert with @entity121 allies to be effective			1
so far , @entity215 noted , there has been little sign of support from key allies @entity76 and @entity78 for tough economic sanctions against @entity10			2
meanwhile , house speaker @entity220 called for @entity4 to speed up government approval of @entity71 natural gas exports to the @entity1			1
" we should not force our allies to remain dependent on @entity21 for their energy needs , " @entity220 said , describing the current approval process as a " de facto ban			0
" " expediting approval of natural gas exports is one clear step the @entity71 can take to stand by our allies and stand up to @entity10 aggression , while creating @entity71 jobs at the same time , " he said			2
@entity21 : @entity10 has no plans to annex @entity13 to @entity4 and his supporters pursuing what they consider to be a @entity237 world order , the @entity10 military moves would arouse the suspicions of other countries in the region			2
" if anything , it will push many countries further away from @entity10 , " @entity4 said			2
" there is the ability for @entity1 to be a friend of the @entity246 and a friend of @entity10 's as long as none of us are in @entity1 trying to meddle and intervene , certainly not militarily , with decisions that properly belong to the @entity1 people			0
" loan guarantees the loan guarantees announced tuesday will help @entity1 move forward with an assistance package from the @entity255 , which is calling for the country to raise energy prices			0
@entity4 administration officials traveling with @entity9 said @entity260 technical advisers would travel to @entity1 to help its national bank and finance ministry deal with economic challenges and implement energy sector reforms			1
the @entity71 also will train observers for the may 25 elections , and is sending a team of experts to help identify stolen assets and support anti-corruption measures			0
with @entity1 looking to reduce dependence on @entity10 energy , the @entity71 also will provide assistance and financing to help businesses find new export markets and will offer technical advice to the government on @entity1 's @entity280 rights with respect to @entity10			1
@entity4 and @entity9 both urged @entity10 to pull its forces back into their barracks and agree to international observers in @entity1 to monitor the situation			1
the @entity286 , a regional security bloc , sent in 10 monitors monday , and @entity9 called for a larger mission			0
" these are the people who could actually identify legitimate threats , and we are asking , together with the government of @entity1 , together with the @entity121 community , for large numbers of observers to be able to come in here and monitor the situation and be the arbiters of truth versus fiction , " he said , alluding to the @entity10 claims of persecution			1
@entity2 foreign affairs reporter @entity304 reported from @entity0 and @entity305 from @entity26 , and @entity2 's @entity306 contributed to this report .			0
