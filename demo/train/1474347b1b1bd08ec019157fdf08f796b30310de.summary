@entity0 , @entity1 -- guests at restaurants in @entity1 's @entity5 must say good - bye to the salt shaker			1
in an effort to combat hypertension , which affects some 3.7 million residents in the province -- nearly a quarter of the population , the health department reached an agreement with the hotel and restaurant federation to remove salt shakers from the tables at their eateries			1
" on average , each @entity1 consumes 13 grams of salt daily , while according to the @entity25 , you should consume less than five , " health minister @entity20 said when he announced the change last month			2
the measure is not as extreme as it sounds			0
@entity27 will be available by request , but only after the patrons have tasted their food			0
the government also signed an agreement with the local breadmakers federation to reduce by 40 % the amount of sodium in bread sold in the province			1
" to reduce consumption ( of salt ) , we will recommend to the breadmakers to reduce to 750 grams of salt per bag of 50 kilograms of flour , that is , 100 less grams that what is normally added , " said @entity38 , head of the breadmakers federation			1
@entity20 said that if @entity0 residents can reduce their daily salt intake by three grams , it could save about 2,000 lives a year			1
hypertension , commonly known as high blood pressure , has been linked to high salt and sodium consumption , but there is still debate on the issue			1
a study by @entity60 researchers released just weeks before the new @entity0 salt restrictions discounted the link between salt and hypertension			1
" the chef or cook already in preparing ( a meal ) puts salt on it , and the client without tasting it adds more salt on top , " said restuarant owner @entity65			2
guests were divided on the new measure			0
" for me , this is perfect , " said retiree @entity75			0
" in reality i would not miss ( a salt shaker ) if it was not on the table			2
" businessman @entity80 had a problem with the restrictions			0
" i am against prohibitions , " he said			0
" i think that we have to educate people so that they know what to do , not prohibit it , but put it as an option			0
" @entity2 's @entity90 contributed to this report .			0
