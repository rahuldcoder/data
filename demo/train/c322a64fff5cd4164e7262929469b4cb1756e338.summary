@entity0 -- it was meant to be a show - stopping display of military might , a rocket poised to enter orbit to celebrate 100 years since the birth of the man who founded @entity9			1
but while the rapid disintegration of @entity12 may have drawn sighs of relief from countries along its planned trajectory , one analyst says in this case failure may be more dangerous than success			1
" given the technology failure on such an important occasion on the 100th anniversary of @entity27 , and given the failure of the symbolism of that , there 's perhaps a need to compensate in some way , " said @entity20 , program director of international security at the @entity22			1
that compensation could come in the form of short - range missile tests , @entity20 said			0
however , he added that " they 've done it so many times before that it 's not all that impressive			2
" the alternative might be a nuclear test , @entity42 's third since 2006 , and another way for new leader @entity44 to convey his power to the @entity9 people			1
" i would n't exaggerate it , but the chance of a nuclear test this year is now higher than it was yesterday , " he said			1
in the days before friday 's launch , @entity51 intelligence officers predicted that @entity9 would use the international chorus of condemnation over the rocket launch as an excuse to test its nuclear technology			1
in a report obtained by @entity1 , they said recent satellite images showed the final stages of a tunnel being dug at @entity62 , the site of two previous tests in 2006 and 2009			0
" their nuclear test in 2006 is believed to have been a fizzer , the one in 2009 was still very small by standards of nuclear weapons , so there 's an argument that their military would want to test again anyway , " @entity20 said			1
" also their previous tests used a plutonium design , and they may want to prove a uranium bomb			0
" a nuclear test would also fit @entity9 's pattern of serial provocations , analysts said			1
" certainly in 2006 , you see a launch , you see a condemnation and some @entity91 sanctions , " said @entity83 , director of the @entity84 at the @entity85 at the @entity85			0
" you see some very tough words form the @entity9 and then you see a @entity9 nuclear test			1
so it would n't surprise me to see that pattern play out again , " he said			0
while the cycle of @entity9 provocation and diplomacy might follow a predictable path , questions remain as to why the country pressed ahead with a rocket launch that , based on previous attempts , seemed destined to fail			1
unlike previous launches , international media was invited to view launch preparations			0
they were given an unprecedented tour of the launch site and then front - row seats in a press center that showed blank screens as word spread outside the country that the launch had failed			0
@entity83 said , by inviting journalists , @entity42 may have been seeking to remove a layer of secrecy surrounding the event , thus reducing the likelihood of harsh international sanctions to a launch planned well before recent negotiations with the @entity126 over the resumption of food aid			0
" i really think that fundamentally they wanted to go ahead with this launch and they were trying to remove some of the pressure that was on them , reduce the chance of sanctions , " he said			2
" bringing in the reporters was all part of their efforts at trying to be transparent			0
in a way they were sort of deluding themselves			0
" in late february , @entity9 announced an agreement to freeze its nuclear and missile tests , along with uranium enrichment programs , and allow the return of @entity148 nuclear inspectors			2
at the same time , the @entity126 said it would provide 240,000 metric tons of food aid to the impoverished country			0
the deal is now off after the launch which the @entity153 says " threatens regional security , violates international law and contravenes its own recent commitments			0
" @entity83 said he believes friday 's rocket launch was the main motivation behind @entity42 's recent willingness to engage with @entity126 negotiators			1
" people have tended to assume it must have been about the nutritional assistance			0
but i think it makes much more sense to imagine that they knew that they were going to do this rocket launch			1
and they knew that that would trigger a round of sanctions and hostility so they may have been bargaining to try to have the rocket launch , without all the sanctions , " @entity83 said			1
any @entity9 strategy to avoid tough international sanctions seems to have backfired amid a storm of criticism ahead of a @entity91 meeting on the launch on friday			2
the regime 's attempts to broadcast a powerful image to its people also seemed to have crashed along with the rocket debris			2
@entity42 's unprecedented admission of the launch 's failure is a sign , analysts said , that the regime is aware that it 's getting harder to shield the truth from its people			2
" it is just getting a little bit incrementally harder each year in @entity9 to completely deceive its population about what 's known in the outside world			2
and in this case , you had that extra pressure of expectation from the 100th birthday celebrations and the presence of the foreign media , " @entity20 said			0
" perhaps @entity9 's leaders recognize better than we imagined how much information technology has changed the world , " @entity83 added .			1

@entity9 's rocket launch failure increases chance of nuclear test , analyst said
@entity12 broke up soon after launch , debris crashed into ocean , officials said
launch was meant to mark 100 years since the birth of @entity27
a nuclear test would also fit @entity9 's pattern of serial provocations , analysts said
