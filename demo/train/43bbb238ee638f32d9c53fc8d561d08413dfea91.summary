@entity0 , @entity1 -- taking risks in life with her career , and less so at the buffet table , have served @entity8 and her readers well			1
the longtime @entity11 champagne house executive has a wisdom about women , @entity14 and otherwise , that 's made her one others turn to for advice			1
the former ceo and best - selling author of " @entity20 " and " @entity21 " is now toasting her latest book , " @entity23 : @entity24			1
" inspired by the young women who 've approached her for guidance , @entity8 , who splits her time between @entity29 and @entity30 , set out to impart what she 's learned through her career			1
" we have to help each other and help especially the young generation progress and not make the same mistakes we did , " she said			0
" these very difficult times , with the recession and all of that , are actually a positive for women because it gives us a chance to make a difference and show that we are becoming the majority , and we should be treated as such			1
" @entity2 sat down recently with @entity8 to discuss the word that hurts the careers of women most , the lessons her mother taught her and any last - minute tips she has to prevent holiday - food overindulgence			1
here are excerpts from that interview : @entity2 : what exactly is this art of savoir faire you speak of ? @entity8 : @entity59 is a complex set , a mix i should say , of competence , experience and knowing somehow instinctively how to make a decision in a given situation			1
[ it 's ] creating your own luck and your own opportunities and then making the most of them			0
@entity2 : what are the pitfalls you 've seen women fall into most often and how do you think they can be avoided ? @entity8 : the word that i found comes back over and over again in women 's lives when it pertains to their professions is the word fear			1
they 're afraid to make a move			1
they 're afraid to take a job in another state or another city or another country			0
they 're afraid to go for an interview			0
they 're afraid to take a promotion because they might not be up to the job			0
it comes from our culture , of course , the low self - esteem and low confidence we have , and we have to change that			2
@entity2 : how did you not fall into that trap ? @entity8 : i used my mother 's management principle , which was ironic because my mother did n't go to school and was n't a businesswoman			1
but she told me to not be afraid to take risks and to ask myself , " what is the worst thing that can happen ? " ... when you have that in mind , it gives you a special strength to go ahead , be bold and take the chances			1
@entity2 : when you talk about what " our culture " has taught women , do you see a difference between @entity121 women and @entity14 women ? and as a @entity14 who 's lived and worked in @entity29 , what have those differences meant to you ? @entity8 : being and working in @entity121 , it 's very important to work hard , work smart and work in a certain way			1
@entity14 and @entity128 has , with the tradition and culture , it 's slow - moving and it 's not always good			2
so you have to find a balance between the two			2
i know that i could have never accomplished what i have if i had stayed in @entity14			0
@entity2 : why do you say that ? @entity8 : because the opportunities were not there			1
because it 's much more of a man 's world			0
in @entity14 , it 's still very difficult for women to move ahead and to get into the boardroom or [ serve as ] ceo and all of that			1
@entity2 : but what about the need for more balance in @entity121 women 's lives ? @entity8 : balance -- that 's what it 's about			1
at the end of the day , each of us is responsible for our own balance			2
it starts with the physical because when you are healthy physically , of course , you have more energy , you are more bubbly , you are more productive , you 're a happier person			2
and i believe it 's contagious			0
your spouse will notice it , your colleagues will notice it , and it will have a tremendous positive effect on the way you work , the way you think and the way you do everything			2
@entity2 : do you have tips on how to achieve this ? @entity8 : find times to relax , to pursue your hobbies , your moments because this is very important			1
it 's unfortunate that sometimes our companies , our bosses do n't understand that we need that time			0
actually it makes us better workers			0
we should n't feel guilty going for a walk at lunch , as opposed to eating at our desks			2
each of us has different ways			0
for you , it might be five minutes , three times a day , of deep breathing			0
and for me it might be 20 minutes of yoga in the morning			0
or for someone else it might be listening to music or going for a walk			0
whatever it is , you need that			0
@entity2 : you 've also , since your first book , emphasized the importance of eating well			1
we are in the midst of the most gluttonous season , and though it might be a little late to apply your advice this year around , do you have any last - minute tips for how we can approach holiday parties ? @entity8 : you have to apply a few commonsense tricks			1
at most of those parties , the food is not that great to start with , so do n't go hungry and starving			0
have two tablespoons of a yogurt or a sliver of cheese or a few nuts or a hard - boiled egg or an apple before you go , so you 're not starving , and then try not to be too close to the food			2
or look at all the food and pick two or three things you like and just have small portions , small bites			0
... people in @entity121 , in the @entity233 world , tend to say " no bread			0
" you can have a little bit of everything			0
it 's all about moderation and balance .			2

@entity8 , best - selling author , promotes latest book about work life
women mentoring other women is *key* to *growth* , as is finding balance , @entity8 says
letting go of fear allows women to take risks and move ahead , author adds
balance is tied to physical health and sensible eating , a *doable* holiday *challenge*
