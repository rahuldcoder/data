-- news that the @entity2 is considering a military strike on @entity4 in response to the @entity8 regime 's suspected use of chemical weapons suggests we could soon see an @entity2 bombing campaign on the war - torn country			1
the atrocities that took place in @entity4 recently , such as those that have been taking place there for almost two years , are deplorable and inhuman			2
before bombing @entity4 over the regime 's latest crimes , however , we should stand back and ask , " and then what ? " @entity22 : for @entity2 , @entity4 is truly a problem from hell a brief bombing campaign in @entity4 might make the @entity2 and its allies feel like they are doing something , but it will prove nothing			2
we have already abstained from getting involved in the civil war for two years and have chosen not to respond to evidence ( albeit less clear ) of another chemical attack this year			1
we have already concluded that as terrible as the civil war is , it can not be our war			1
the bombing will not change this -- and then what ? both sides in @entity4 are bad			0
one side is a brutal dictator , and the other includes islamists and terrorists who are dangerous already and who would be brutal in power if given the chance			0
we will not spend the time , money and blood to create a desirable side in @entity4			1
there is no victory to be had there			0
@entity4 is not the greatest threat in the @entity55 to @entity2 or world security			1
the @entity58 regime is working every day to get a nuclear weapon			2
it poses a direct threat to @entity63 's survival and a long - term threat to @entity2			0
the conflicts in @entity4 , @entity66 and @entity67 are small threats compared with the disaster that could ensue and the lives that would be endangered if @entity58 succeeds in its drive for nuclear weapons			1
we should focus more on the truly big threat ahead of the headlines of the day -- or we will be reading much worse headlines in the future			0
