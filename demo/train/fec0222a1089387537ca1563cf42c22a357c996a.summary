the number of confirmed dead throughout @entity16 from the flooding that began last week stood at seven friday , just as it was a day earlier			1
another three people are presumed dead in @entity19 , which straddles the @entity21 border			1
another 82 people there were still unaccounted for as of friday afternoon , county sheriff 's office spokesman @entity24 said			1
then there 's the sizable toll flooding has had on buildings , roads and bridges , as well as the natural surroundings that in many ways define @entity16			2
" we 're about to embark on a rebuilding effort that is truly epic in scale , " gov. @entity34 said thursday			0
this includes oil and gas that leaked in lakes , rivers , streams and more as the floods rolled in			1
@entity16 's @entity45 , the industry 's trade association , said no fracking operations were underway when the floods hit -- meaning " no fracking fluids , no chemicals associated with fracking , nor equipment were on sites at the time of the flooding			1
" yet as of friday morning -- at which point about 70 % of the impacted area still had n't been assessed -- state authorities were tracking 11 locations with a sheen or other evidence of leaked oil and gas			2
this is in addition to at least five sizable releases of oil , including two recently confirmed into the @entity71 near @entity72 , state @entity66 spokesman @entity65 said friday			1
four of these instances ( the other is still being assessed ) involved the release of about 22,000 gallons of oil , according to @entity77			1

and a @entity84 aerial survey conducted on thursday found as many as two dozen fuel tanks overturned			1
tap water has been turned off for @entity87 , a town of about 2,000 people located some 17 miles north of @entity90 that was decimated by the floods , after tests showed the bacteria @entity13 , better known as @entity13			1
while most e. coli strains are harmless and live in healthy humans and animals ' intestines , the bacteria can cause diarrhea , urinary tract infections , pneumonia and other illness when passed through contaminated water or food , according to the @entity104			0
" there has been a breach , and we do n't want you using any of the water , " @entity87 town administrator @entity105 said at a public meeting thursday			2
" ... it 's critical we get that back up and get it disinfected before we would ... want any of you to be back			0
" such environmental issues , as well as the personal impact on thousands of families , stem from a torrential rains that fell september 12 in mountainous areas north of @entity119 -- more than nine inches , in some places			0
such downpours persisted for several more days , adding up to 18.1 inches in parts of @entity124 and 15.6 inches in @entity125 , @entity34 's office said			0
the heavy rainfall spurred flash floods that turned picturesque canyons into funnels that deluged towns downstream and left hundreds stranded			2

rescuers resumed airlifts friday to pluck out those stuck in their homes , according to @entity24			2
