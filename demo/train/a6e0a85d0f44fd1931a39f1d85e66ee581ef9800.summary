-- not only is @entity1 the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the @entity3 , the first female minister of economy in the @entity5 , and the first to start a @entity7 bb marketplace , but she 's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line			1
member of @entity12 royal family and one of @entity15 ' 100 most powerful women , @entity1 took the post of minister for economy and planning of @entity3 in 2004			1
her background is in @entity21 and before the government appointment worked at the @entity23 where she gained the " @entity26 " in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes			2
in 2000 , @entity1 founded @entity27 , the first @entity7 business - to - business marketplace			1
as a result of @entity27 ( @entity32 for commerce ) 70 percent of @entity30 's government purchases are made online , while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web - literate before its launch			2
one of the cornerstones of @entity1 's work has been to allow for foreign ownership , so when @entity41 met up with her , he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy			1
@entity1 : we are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors			1
we will evaluate each sector , from the service side , finance , accounting			2
and any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth , then we will focus on that : on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company			1
@entity41 : if you look at the @entity7 , specifically within this @entity5 region , it 's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership			1
is this society in the region ready for this move ? @entity1 : interestingly , the @entity3 is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside			1
we host 200 nationalities , so for us , the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community			2
so in many ways i think the openness is only a natural path : it 's an organic path to continue the openness that exists			1
foreign direct investment is not your own wealth			2
when you have your own wealth , you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes , because it 's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure			2
however , if you look at foreign direct investment , it mandates you to be much more transparent , you have to be very diligent about your work , and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment			2
@entity41 : it 's interesting , you read the front line of the @entity23 , @entity96 acquisition and the furor it created in the @entity98 particularly within @entity99			0
what are the lessons , not just from the @entity3 perspective , but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process ? @entity1 : first of all , i think it is important to understand , in this global world , there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere			1
liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad			0
we 've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad			0
and we 've seen this where the @entity3 invests in the @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 as well as in @entity127 and the @entity98			1
what 's more important to understand is that if you 're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that i do n't want to sell to this particular organization versus another , there are other places			1
@entity41 : that 's not a veiled message your saying , that 's pretty forthright this comment			0
@entity1 : but it 's a message to all of us			1
if today i lock up my investment opportunity here , money will not come to me , money will go somewhere else			2
when i have investment coming from abroad , it creates confidence in this country that ' i am a global image '			0
so when i say it , i am not directing this as a message to a particular country			0
i am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation , when it comes to responsibility , when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country			1
so that 's really a lesson that 's very very critical			0
@entity41 : a number of firsts : the first to start a b2b marketplace ; the first female minister within the country , an economy minister ; and the first to launch a perfume range as well			1
what is it all about ? trailblazing , setting examples , being an entrepreneur ? how would you describe what you 're doing here ? @entity1 : everybody laughs about the perfume			1
one , i think the @entity3 , since inception ( it 's not from today but from the founder late @entity185 ) has always given equal opportunities for women			1
but it 's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push , and what it is that we can do and not do			0
in my personal belief you need a bridge , you need a door opener for women			0
and sometimes women do not want to take the risk			0
sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving			0
i had the opportunity and i had the trust from the government and the community , so to me , it is setting the example internally for the young women , and men by the way			0
be it in technology , or economy or e-commerce			0
@entity41 : and the perfume line is the exclamation point ? @entity1 : a young woman , actually a perfume creator , who sells exclusively to @entity220 in @entity30 , decided to create a perfume with my name			2
so i had two mandates from her			0
@entity225 , i had to smell it , otherwise if it does n't smell good i 'm not going to take it as a name			0
so one , i had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume			0
and it 's an @entity32 perfume by the way			0
and second , my mandate was that i would only launch it with my name for her , if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the @entity242			0

@entity1 was first female minister in the @entity3
openness to foreign ownership is the " natural path " , she says
if countries " lock up " interest *due* to protectionism there are other places to go
