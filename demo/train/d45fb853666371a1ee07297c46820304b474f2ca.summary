-- if there was ever a time to doubt the prognosticating abilities of @entity5 , this might be it			0
last month , the legendary @entity8 groundhog failed to see his shadow , thereby predicting an early spring			2
but at this point , people in the @entity12 and @entity13 would have been happy if it felt like spring when the season officially began -- on wednesday -- as winter wo n't go quietly			1
much of @entity17 was pummeled with snow saturday , causing travel - related and assorted other headaches			1
in the eastern part of the state , white - out conditions prompted authorities to close 154 miles of @entity24 from @entity25 to the @entity27 line			1
and those wishing to fly out of @entity29 just had to wait			0
about 45 miles north of @entity25 , @entity32 northbound shut down saturday afternoon after a weather - related incident ensnared 20 to 50 vehicles that either crashed or spun off the roadway , the @entity30 reports			1
flames engulfed a semi-tanker caught up in the mess , which also affected at least four tractor - trailer trucks			1
@entity41 posted on @entity0 affiliate @entity42 's website showed the burning tanker , with parts of two cars pinned underneath			2
that part of the highway stayed closed until 4:30 p.m. ( 6:30 p.m. et )			2
even then , the @entity49 warned drivers that there were still " high winds and poor visibility in the area			1
" weather groundhog @entity5 ' indicted , ' accused of lying but at least folks in @entity17 can take solace in the fact the snow should stop saturday night			1
the same can not be said for points east , from @entity27 and far beyond			0
while they 're expire soon in the @entity17 , winter storm warnings will be in effect for four other states through , in some spots , sunday night			1
the fun has already started in parts of @entity27 and @entity68 , with the snowstorm expected to roll over the @entity70 between interstate highways 70 and 80 , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity72			2
@entity74 and @entity75 , for instance , are among those cities facing winter storm warnings thanks to snow that could fall through late sunday			0
the system will continue to barrel east from there , dumping snow on @entity82 , @entity83 , and , by monday , possibly on @entity84 , @entity72 said			2
and it 's not just a matter of snow			0
in many locations , the storm will kick off as rain before temperatures cool and it changes to snow -- with other precipitation permutations such as sleet possible			0
add in winds that could gust up to 40 mph , it equates to a big wintry mess -- whatever the calendar says			0
you call this spring ? " i do n't think this will be one for the record books , but it is definitely going to add some interest this weekend and to the work week , " @entity72 said			0
winter weather overstays its welcome			0
