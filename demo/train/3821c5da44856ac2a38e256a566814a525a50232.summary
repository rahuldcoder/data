-- progress against global diseases is typically slow , incremental and hard - won			1
but there are moments -- such as wednesday 's release of the @entity7 's @entity6 -- when the cumulative effort of dozens of nations , millions of people and billions of dollars adds up to a true breakthrough			0
with the new report , we have turned a corner in the malaria fight			1
we have reduced the rate of deaths from malaria among children under 5 by 51 % from 2000 to 2012 -- halfway to our goal of ending death by mosquito bite			1
for the first time , the number of children dying from this preventable and treatable disease fell below half a million			1
progress against malaria is responsible for fully 20 % of the reduction in child mortality since 2000			1
malaria control has saved 3.3 million lives since 2000 -- 3 million of them children under 5			1
this progress stands out as one of the great success stories in global health , even in human history			2
it 's especially impressive when you consider that malaria has been with us since the dawn of man and , by some accounts , has killed more people than any other cause in human history : more than war , famine or any other disease			1
despite today 's progress , malaria remains one of the biggest impediments to saving lives , improving health and unlocking human potential in much of the developing world			1
it threatens 3.4 billion people -- roughly half the globe -- and is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism in @entity66			2
@entity67 literally sucks the lifeblood ( energy , livelihood and productivity ) from the @entity73 continent			0
i often compare the malaria fight to the moonshot			1
both are human milestones , measures of our progress as a species and a society			2
and both were made possible by @entity86 vision and leadership			1
the seeds of today 's progress were sown under president @entity89 with the launch of the @entity91 in 2002 and the @entity86 president 's @entity92 in 2005			1
these efforts have accelerated under president @entity95 , who has expanded the initiative and recently committed to provide $ 1 to the @entity91 for every $ 2 contributed by the rest of the world , up to $ 5 billion by 2016			1
these investments are paying off , not only in children 's lives saved but also in promoting stable , productive nations by keeping children in school , workers at their jobs and families financially secure			2
as former secretary of state @entity110 recently said , " fighting malaria is not only the right thing to do , it 's also the smart thing			0
" much of the progress to date comes from expanded access to simple tools such as insecticide - treated mosquito nets , and we must maintain high levels of coverage			2
but how do we end the other 50 % of child deaths ? how do we ensure that no child dies from a mosquito bite and that we ultimately eradicate this disease from the planet ? the answer comes down to three cheap , revolutionary tools			0
the first is a rapid diagnostic test , or @entity128			0
until a few years ago , there was no practical way to get a timely , accurate diagnosis for malaria			0
if someone thought they might have malaria , they had to travel to a distant clinic that had an expensive microscope -- and a trained lab technician who would examine a drop of blood under a microscope -- and hope the doctor read it right			0
this simple , 50 - cent device tells you in a matter of minutes with 99 % accuracy if you have the malaria parasite in your body			2
there are now 200 million of these tests deployed in @entity66 each year , and they 're transforming the fight against malaria -- driving timely treatment and ensuring people who have other illnesses -- such as pneumonia or respiratory infection -- get the lifesaving care they need			1
the second tool is malaria treatment : artemisinin - based combination therapies , or @entity165			1
it costs less than $ 1 to deliver a full course of lifesaving treatment to a child in @entity66			0
and the simple fact is : if a child with malaria gets this $ 1 worth of medicine in time , he or she will not die			0
at @entity177 , we 're helping to close the testing and treatment gaps in @entity66 through our new power of one campaign , where every dollar provides a lifesaving test and treatment			0
the third tool may surprise you : a mobile phone			0
there 's a mobile revolution under way in @entity66			0
by 2015 , there 'll be more than 1 billion mobile phones on the continent			0
they 're not only transforming communication and commerce but also how we fight communicable disease			0
@entity198 is helping us solve a whole slew of problems in the malaria fight : address health facilities that have a shortage of lifesaving treatments by providing timely updates on stock levels , fight counterfeit drugs by enabling consumers to text a code to confirm a malaria treatment is authentic , expand the reach of health education to ensure people sleep under their mosquito nets and provide the real - time data on malaria cases that is the prerequisite for strategies to eliminate the disease			1
these tools are helping us work faster , smarter and more cost effectively			0
with their help -- and continued investment -- we can write malaria into the history books			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : new report finds impressive progress against malaria
rate of death among children under 5 has been cut in half , he says
@entity229 says new diagnostic and treatment *options* are **key** *weapons* in the fight
he says *stepped* - up @entity86 aid , from @entity89 and @entity95 , has played a **key** role
