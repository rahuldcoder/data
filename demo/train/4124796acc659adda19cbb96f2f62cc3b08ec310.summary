@entity0 -- sunday marks the second anniversary of the @entity4 massacre that killed twenty children and six teachers on december 14 , 2012			1
and though @entity8 has n't passed any gun reform laws in its wake , there 's one senator who 's made it his mission to persistently push for changes , even when no one 's listening			1
for the past two years , @entity17 sen. @entity16 , a @entity18 , has been traveling to the @entity20 floor , month after month , to detail the growing numbers of people killed by gun violence			1
he calls these speeches , " @entity25			0
" asked what drives him to continually make his plea , he said it 's to keep " the drum beat up on the @entity20 floor			0
" to him , telling victim 's stories , identifying who they were , what they enjoyed , where they lived , personalizes the issue and hopefully makes it harder for his colleagues and state lawmakers to ignore			2
related : @entity40 : on guns , all we have is talk " there 's no more personal issue than gun violence ; every one of these stories is a life lost , " he said			2
" i 'm hoping that over the long term , as i tell these stories , that it will help to open people 's eyes			0
" " it is beyond comprehension that @entity8 is watching this epidemic of school shootings and chooses to do nothing , " @entity16 added			1
@entity16 's uphill battle for comprehensive gun control reform , however , is met with significant challenges			1
since the shooting at @entity4 , and the many that followed , there 's been no legislation on the issue			1
after a failed vote on a bill that would have broadened background checks for gun purchasers in april 2013 , there 's been no sign of any additional legislation			0
and with republicans maintaining the @entity78 and winning the @entity20 as a result of the midterm election , @entity16 's push for gun control legislation and background checks has n't gotten any easier			1
incoming senate majority leader @entity81 is a staunch supporter of the @entity83 and 90 percent of @entity83 - backed candidates won their seats during midterm elections			0
" [ the @entity83 ] is absolutely pulling one over on their members , " @entity16 said			0
" the @entity83 was for background checks a decade ago , and they changed their position , despite the fact that their members support background checks			0
" a new @entity93 survey released earlier this week indicates additional challenges for gun control advocates			1
according to the survey , the number of people supporting gun rights now offsets those who support gun control with 52 percent of @entity100 siding with gun rights , and 46 percent siding with gun control			2
on wednesday , @entity16 acknowledged the challenges for achieving gun control legislation with the @entity107 - led @entity8 during a @entity20 floor speech , but hinted he might be finding a new way to challenge the issue			1
" i get it that we 're not going to get a background checks bill passed through the @entity20 in the next two years , but why not work on mental health funding ? " he asked			0
either way , @entity16 is not giving up			0
he acknowledged that fighting for stricter gun laws is a lifelong campaign for the families affected by @entity4			2
" it gives me hope that if i stick with this , families will stick with this alongside me , " he said .			0
