@entity5 , who provided classified government documents to @entity7 detailing , among other things , @entity3 's undisclosed policies on torture , was found guilty of espionage on tuesday			1
the verdict comes on the 235th anniversary of the passage of @entity3 's first whistle - blower protection law , approved by the @entity14 after two @entity16 officers were arrested and harassed for having reported the torture of @entity19 prisoners			1
how have we gotten to the place where the revelation of torture is no longer laudable whistle - blowing , but now counts as espionage ? the answer is that government has not yet come to terms with the persistence and transparency of the digital age			1
information moves so fast and to so many places that controlling it is no longer an option			2
every datapoint , whether a perverted tweet by an aspiring mayor or a classified video of @entity38 news staffers being gunned down by an @entity40 helicopter , will somehow find the light of day			2
it 's enough to make any administration tremble , but it 's particularly traumatic for one with things to hide			0
that 's why they tried to throw the book , and then some , at @entity5			1
prosecutors cast simple @entity52 commands known to any halfway literate internet user ( or anyone who used the internet back in the early ' 90s ) as clandestine codes used only by hackers to steal data			0
that @entity59 could download these files off the @entity7 website ( along with millions of other people ) became justification for classifying the whistle - blowing as espionage , an act of war			1
and @entity5 is just one of a record seven @entity3 charged with violating the @entity68 in a single administration			1
but prosecuting those whose keyboards or usb sticks may have been technically responsible for the revelations is futile			0
the more networked we become and the more data we collect , the more likely something will eventually find its way out			0
after all , a security culture based on surveillance and big data cuts both ways			0
moreover , harsh reaction to digital whistle - blowers only increases the greater population 's suspicions that more information is being hidden			1
in this one leaking incident , @entity5 exposed allegations of torture , undisclosed civilian death tolls in @entity103 and @entity104 , official orders not to investigate torture by nations holding our prisoners , accusations of the torture of @entity112 prisoners at @entity113 , the " collateral murder " video of @entity38 journalists and @entity104 civilians as @entity3 soldiers cheered , @entity94 support of corporations opposing @entity97 minimum wage , training of @entity89 torturers by the @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity3 authorized stealing of @entity121 secretary general 's dna -- the list goes on			1
these are not launch codes for nuclear strikes , operational secrets or even plans for future military missions			2
rather , they are documentation of past activity and officially sanctioned military and state policy			0
these are not our secrets , but our ongoing actions and approaches			1
a thinking government -- a virtuous one , if we can still use such a word -- would treat this as a necessary intervention			1
things have gone too far			0
but ours is a government in " present shock " : an always - on , always - connected population puts the administration in a state of perpetual emergency interruption			1
it 's not the phone call at 2 a.m. for which a president has to be prepared , but the tweet at 3 , the @entity151 update at 4 , the @entity154 video at 5 , and on and on			0
in such a crisis - to - crisis landscape , there 's no time to implement or even articulate a " grand narrative			2
" a real - time , digital world offers no sense of mission or opportunity to tell a story			1
there 's no @entity165 to win			0
no moon shot to work toward			0
there are just emergent threats , one after the other after the other			0
things just exist in the present , one tweet - or , actually , many tweets - at a time			2
this makes it exceedingly difficult to frame our policies and strategies with language and purpose			0
it 's no longer a matter of walking the talk			0
without the talk , there 's only the walk			0
we have no way of judging the ethics and intentions of our government except by what it actually does			2
combine this with the transparency that comes with digital technology and our leaders simply have no choice but to do the right thing			1
it takes more energy to prevent exposure than simply to behave consistently with the values we want to project			0
just as corporations are learning that they can no longer maintain low prices through overseas slave labor without getting caught , a democratic government can no longer maintain security through torture and coercion without being exposed			1
betraying our respect for human dignity only makes us less resolved as a people , and less trusted as a nation			0
we are just beginning to learn what makes a free people secure in a digital age			1
the @entity165 was an era of paper records , locked vaults and state secrets , for which a cloak - and - dagger mindset may have been appropriate			1
in a digital environment , our security comes not from our ability to keep our secrets but rather our ability to live our truth			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 : @entity5 found guilty of espionage . why is whistle - blowing *punishable* ?
he says @entity3 government has **n't** faced it ca **n't** control info in digital age of easy access
he says @entity5 exposed *objectionable* official actions of @entity3 -- not secrets , but approaches
@entity231 : the transparency of a digital age means @entity3 has no choice but to do right thing
