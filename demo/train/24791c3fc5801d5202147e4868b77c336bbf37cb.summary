-- a late strike from @entity2 , set up by the returning @entity3 , helped @entity4 maintain their quest for a first @entity6 in 44 years with a 2 - 1 win over @entity8 on wednesday			1
the @entity13 international collected a clever reverse pass from @entity3 , making his first appearance in five months after falling out with manager @entity11 , to score an 86th - minute winner			0
@entity4 had trailed to @entity15 's deflected strike until @entity16 leveled the match from the penalty spot with 12 minutes remaining			0
the victory maintains @entity4 's 100 % record in home league matches this season and draws them within a point of @entity26 leaders and bitter rivals @entity27			2
the buildup to the match was dominated by the return of @entity3 , who had n't featured for @entity4 since refusing to warm up during a @entity32 clash with @entity33 back in september			0
he took his place on the bench to a mixture of boos and applause , and he was called upon in the 66th minute after @entity15 had pounced on a loose ball in the area to fire a shot into the net via an inadvertent flick from @entity45			0
but when @entity47 's shot hit the arm of @entity8 substitute @entity49 , @entity4 were handed a lifeline and @entity51 striker @entity16 slotted home the spot kick			2
then @entity3 played a cute one - two with @entity2 , and the midfielder dinked the ball over @entity8 keeper @entity55 to secure a vital win			1
on a dramatic night in @entity59 's top flight , @entity57 surrendered third place to @entity61 after being held 1 - 1 at home by @entity63			1
taking to the field for the first time since saturday 's @entity68 quarterfinal clash with @entity69 was abandoned due to @entity71 's cardiac arrest , @entity57 's poor form continued			0
the @entity73 side had to rely on an injury - time goal from @entity76 international @entity75 to salvage a draw after striker @entity78 had put @entity4 in front			0
@entity61 leapfrogged their north @entity73 rivals with a 1 - 0 win at @entity82 , as defender @entity84 's eighth - minute goal put the @entity85 a point clear			1
@entity8 stayed fifth , losing ground on both @entity57 and @entity61 in the race to finish in the fourth and final @entity32 qualification spot			2
@entity91 's hopes of finishing fourth are all but over after squandering a two - goal lead to lose 3 - 2 to relegation threatened @entity94			1
@entity96 international @entity95 put @entity91 ahead with a superb volley early on before @entity98 made it 2 - 0 on 72 minutes			1
but @entity94 hit back with three goals in the last 14 minutes , from @entity100 , former @entity91 striker @entity101 and @entity102			0
the result kept @entity91 seven points behind @entity8 , while @entity94 moved out of the relegation zone , moving one point clear of @entity69 .			2

@entity2 's late goal helps @entity4 to a dramatic 2 - 1 win over @entity8
@entity3 sets up winning goal as @entity4 move within one point of leaders @entity27
@entity61 move into third after *beating* @entity82 1 - 0 while @entity57 and @entity63 drew 1 - 1
@entity91 squander two - goal lead to lose 3 - 2 at @entity94
