@entity0 -- the case of a frequent flier labeled a " frequent complainer " by one airline will soon get a @entity5 review , testing consumer rights against corporate prerogatives			1
the justices will hold an hour of oral arguments tuesday			0
rabbi @entity12 claims his @entity14 membership was revoked after being told he had " abused " his privileges , repeatedly filing complaints for upgrades and other benefits			1
@entity19 , which was consumed by @entity20 in a 2008 merger , said it had " sole judgment " over the program 's general terms and conditions to make such determinations			1
at issue is whether @entity12 has a right under state law to bring his case or whether it is preempted by a 1970s - era federal law that deregulated the airline industry			1
that law prohibits parties from bringing similar state claims against airlines relating to a " price , route , or service " of the carrier			2
@entity12 is dean of @entity41 in @entity42 and travels frequently to lecture and teach			2
he joined @entity19 's @entity14 frequent flier program in 1999 and reached @entity44 s -- the highest level -- in 2005			1
but in june of 2008 , @entity12 claimed a @entity19 representative called him and told him his status was being revoked on grounds that he " abused " the program , according to court papers			1
@entity12 said the airline also took away the hundreds of thousands of miles accumulated in his account			1
" it did n't make sense			0
initially , when they contacted me on the phone i thought it was a prank call , " @entity12 told @entity1			1
" when i pushed for a reason and clarification , they told me it was because i was complaining too much			2
" a month after that call , @entity19 sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months , including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel , according to court papers			1
" you have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines			0
we have awarded you $ 1,925 in travel credit vouchers , 78,500 @entity14 bonus miles , a voucher extension for your son , and $ 491 in cash reimbursements , " the letter said			2
" due to our past generosity , we must respectfully advise that we will no longer be awarding you compensation each time you contact us			0
" @entity12 's lawyers countered the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on @entity19 each year , and that @entity12 estimated that only about 10 % of the trips had resulted in a call to @entity19 's customer care			1
" i do n't think i was a frequent complainer , " @entity12 said			1
" they should have taken their time and analyzed : were my complaints legitimate ? should they be doing something to improve their service and quality of product ? instead of worrying , we 've got to shut up somebody who is complaining too much			0
" later that fall , @entity19 sent @entity12 an e-mail , in which the airline quoted a paragraph from the fine print of the @entity105			1
it stated that @entity19 could determine " in its sole judgment " whether a passenger has abused its program , and that abuse " may result in cancellation of the member 's account and future disqualification from program participation , forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards			1
" @entity12 sued for $ 5 million over a breach of contract in january 2009 , but a federal judge in @entity122 dismissed the class action suit , agreeing with @entity19 that the @entity124 ( @entity125 ) preempted his claim			1
the airline 's lawyers also argued that the @entity14 general terms and conditions did not require @entity19 to provide frequent fliers with lengthy explanations or reasons for its decision to terminate or demote a member 's status in the program			1
but in 2011 , a federal appeals court in @entity139 reversed , and ordered reconsideration of @entity12 's class action claims			1
it said that when @entity143 passed the deregulation law , it did not intend to " immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims			2
" " @entity143 did not intend to convert airlines into quasi-government agencies , complete with sovereign immunity , " said the three - judge panel			0
this dispute turns on a time - tested standard of contract law : the implied " covenant of good faith and fair dealing , " the presumption that two parties will deal squarely with each other			0
lawsuits are typically brought when one party feels the other is using technical excuses to breach its contractual obligations			0
that 's what @entity12 's lawyers will claim in tuesday 's arguments			2
attorney @entity170 says the @entity14 program in itself is not a " service , " as defined by the federal law at issue , and therefore the rabbi 's claim is not preempted			2
" the word ' service ' does not encompass every activity undertaken by an air carrier , " said @entity170			0
" if an airline owned a restaurant , ran a dry cleaner , or managed a sports team , it would not be immunized from following state laws relating to those activities simply because it is an airline			0
rather the ' service ' referred to in the @entity125 is the service customers are buying when they buy an airline ticket : the service of providing air transportation			0
" but the airline counters the ruling from the appeals court was " nothing short of mystifying			0
" " implied covenant claims ask a court to substitute state law for competitive market forces , contrary to @entity143 ' deregulatory intent " under the @entity125 , said @entity197 , the company 's appellate attorney , who will press his arguments before the justices			2
" this case arises in one of the discrete contexts in which ( the federal @entity209 ) retains substantial regulatory authority and capacity			0
if @entity209 determines that airlines are being deceptive or manipulative in exercising their discretion to remove abusive members of their frequent flyer programs ( an unlikely prospect since the programs exist to reward and retain the most valued customers ) , @entity209 has authority to act			0
absent such a determination , there is no role for courts applying state law concepts of fundamental fairness and decency			0
" the @entity229 administration is supporting @entity19			2
@entity12 -- who is still a frequent flier , but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back , have his status reinstated , and get fair compensation for what he claims to have endured			1
" to me , it 's outright fraud			0
you ca n't take somebody 's mileage away when they 've accumulated it , " he said			0
" we live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom			0
" the case is @entity19 v. @entity12 ( 12 - 462 )			1
a ruling is expected by the spring .			0

rabbi @entity12 says he was told he complained too much
@entity19 kicked him out of the frequent flier program
the rabbi lost all of his frequent flier miles as well
the high court will look at consumer rights *vs.* corporate law
