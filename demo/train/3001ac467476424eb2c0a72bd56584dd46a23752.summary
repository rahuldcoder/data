-- @entity1 , the daughter of @entity2 by his first marriage , once told me that her abiding memory of her father over the breakfast table was not of his beaming face , but of the back page of a newspaper			0
one doubts if @entity11 even remembers that			1
judging by his evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into the " industrial - scale " hacking of innocent parties ' phones by the @entity18 and @entity19 -- over which he presided , as executive chairman of their publisher , @entity22 -- he appears to have suffered so bad a case of amnesia that it 's a miracle he even remembered his own name			1
that his inquisitors , competitors and shareholders have struggled to believe his evidence is an understatement			0
nonetheless , it still came as a surprise when @entity11 resigned from his position wednesday , congratulating himself on the successful launch of the new @entity19 on sunday last weekend			1
coming so soon after the closure of the @entity18 -- in apparent contrition for its despicable and illegal snooping , but in fact because advertisers had withdrawn their support -- the publication of the new sunday rag has been widely perceived as an act of breathtaking cynicism			0
pundits have even wondered if it was the @entity49 ' plan all along to cut costs by replacing two papers with one leaner , seven - day operation			2
but that 's another story			0
today 's questions are : why did @entity11 go now ; and how has his departure played in @entity57 , in the press and with the public ? to the first , the quick answer is that his i - do n't - know - nuthin ' stance was becoming untenable			1
even the @entity18 's ex-lawyer has pointed the finger at him , and it can only be a matter of time until hard proof of his complicity in either the hacking or its coverup becomes apparent			2
at another level , it can be seen as a @entity73 move : let the parliamentarians think they 've got a scalp ; and let the public and shareholders think there 's a new broom in @entity81 's @entity80 stable			2
if so , it has certainly impressed the money men : @entity22 's share price rose 2 % on the news , and there is speculation that the company is being primed for a sale			1
many politicians are also happy			1
against all the academic research , it is generally believed that the press has a huge effect on the public 's voting intentions			0
and since the @entity11 press generally leans to the right , while its tormentors lean leftward , they are counting @entity11 ' resignation as a victory for the common man			1
while the @entity107 has been rather muted on the subject , @entity106 's deputy leader @entity105 has weighed in with veiled demands for @entity11 ' arrest and prosecution			2
but what of the common man ? the truth is , he probably does n't give a flying fig. a friend of mine who works in the popular press tells me that she recently commissioned some research into the attitudes of 1,000 former readers of the @entity18			0
" if the paper was still being published , they would still be buying it , " she said			0
" ninety - five percent of them either did n't know or did n't care about the methods by which the paper got its stories			2
" they can feel sympathy for the parents of @entity134 [ the murdered schoolgirl whose phone was hacked by @entity18 investigators ] , as they can for @entity138 [ the celebrity singer and another phone hacking victim ]			0
but at the end of the day , their interest in a story will always outweigh any qualms about how it was obtained			0
" true , the public 's interest in the @entity11 story has hardly been piqued			1
most papers have made very little of it			0
maybe that 's because they have their own misdemeanors to conceal ; maybe because , in such a close - knit profession , it limits job prospects to attack the son of a major employer ; maybe because of an unspoken convention among the press barons that they do n't attack each other			2
but one suspects that our editors know what their readers really care about			0
today , that 's the death of @entity170 frontman @entity169			1
and ai n't that a shame ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity11 resigned as the chairman of @entity22 on wednesday
@entity174 : his i - do n't - know - nuthin ' stance was becoming untenable in the hacking *scandal*
@entity174 : politicians are happy about the resignation and count it as a victory for the public
he says the public has far more interest in the death of @entity169 than @entity11 news
