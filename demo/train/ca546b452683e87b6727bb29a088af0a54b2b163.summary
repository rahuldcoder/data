-- @entity2 's struggling presidential campaign is trying to change the subject this week with stark warnings of chaos in the @entity6			1
it 's trying to scare voters into thinking that his tough talk will somehow make the situation better			0
yet in a recent op - ed calling for a " new course " for the region , @entity2 refused , as usual , to outline any policy specifics , instead putting forth platitudes and falsehoods about president @entity19 's record			1
@entity2 likes to criticize the president 's handling of @entity22 and @entity23 and to recycle tired attacks on his record on @entity22			1
but he repeatedly sidesteps the facts , ignoring @entity19 's unprecedented efforts to make our closest ally in the @entity6 more secure			1
under @entity19 's leadership , @entity22 has received record levels of security assistance , including aid for rocket defenses that have saved @entity22 lives , and our defense and intelligence cooperation has never been better			1
the president has forged an international coalition to prevent @entity23 from acquiring a nuclear weapon			2
under the most crippling sanctions ever imposed , @entity42 's economy is floundering and has never been more isolated			0
@entity19 has repeatedly vowed to use all instruments of national power to ensure @entity23 does not acquire a nuclear weapon , taking no option off the table			2
opinion : debate coach -- @entity19 , @entity2 are top performers beyond @entity2 's cowboy rhetoric , there are zero actual policy differences with @entity19 on @entity23 -- unless @entity2 thinks it 's time to rush to war			1
everything else he says he would do -- crippling sanctions , a credible military option -- the president is already doing			0
on terrorism , which @entity2 never discusses in depth , he has failed to outline any policies to go after @entity64 and its affiliates			0
there is a reason for this : on the president 's watch , @entity69 is dead and more @entity64 senior leaders have been taken off the battlefield than at any time since 9/11			0
@entity2 's op - ed also tried out new arguments against the president 's handling of the @entity78			1
yet @entity2 's position on the @entity78 is particularly incoherent			1
he has tacked between supporting " freedom " and fanning fears of @entity81 , without giving any sign that he understands the complexities of this volatile region			0
his criticism of the president is similarly erratic : sometimes accusing @entity19 of not doing enough to support emerging democracies , and , at other times , seemingly critiquing him for doing too much to support democracy in places such as @entity93			0
perhaps out of fear of offending his party 's warring neoconservatives , realists and isolationists , @entity2 simply refuses to offer any clear position on democracy in the @entity102 world			2
@entity2 's declarations on the @entity6 have been heavy on bold declarations of " leadership " but light on explanation			1
@entity2 's claim that his brash rhetoric will restore order to the region is naive , if not dangerous			1
indeed , the last time the @entity112 enjoyed his brand of " leadership , " we found ourselves trapped in @entity115 , besieged by record levels of @entity117 and confronting an ascendant @entity64			0
@entity118 : dangerous new world of drones similarly , during the intervention in @entity122 , @entity2 never articulated anything resembling a coherent policy			2
he simply refused to take a stand			0
more disturbing , @entity2 's immediate impulse when @entity112 were killed in @entity127 three weeks ago was to try to exploit the issue for political gain -- and he 's been playing politics with the issue ever since			1
while @entity2 has consistently appeared unsteady and unready to handle unfolding events , @entity19 has effectively managed the tumult of the @entity78 , demonstrating strategic patience and confident leadership			2
as millions flooded the streets of @entity102 capitals , @entity19 recognized that the @entity112 should endorse their demands for democratic change and took the lead in helping to broker a peaceful transition in @entity93			0
when @entity143 turned his guns on peaceful protesters , @entity19 led an international coalition that saved tens of thousands of civilians in @entity127 , supported the opposition as it overthrew a brutal regime and helped pave the way toward a new @entity122			0
and in the face of president @entity154 's brutality in @entity155 , the administration is leading international efforts to isolate and sanction the regime , push back against @entity158 intransigence at the @entity159 and work with @entity161 and regional partners to empower the opposition			0
opinion : debate coach : @entity19 , @entity2 are top performers the fact that @entity2 's approach to the @entity6 is all swagger and no substance should come as little surprise			1
after all , @entity2 backed the war in @entity115 , the biggest foreign policy disaster in a generation , and his advisers -- the people who would populate the national security establishment in a @entity2 administration -- are a @entity177 of the war 's architects			1
not only did that war cost more than 4,400 @entity112 lives , leave more than 32,000 @entity112 wounded and cost taxpayers nearly $ 1 trillion -- it empowered @entity23 and @entity155 and undermined @entity112 credibility in the region and around the globe			0
the notion that @entity2 and his team understand the contemporary @entity6 or how best to advance @entity112 interests in this volatile region is impossible to reconcile with this record of catastrophically bad judgment			2
so , while @entity2 attempts to politicize overseas events to divert attention from his sagging numbers in the polls , @entity19 will simply continue to do what he 's done consistently and effectively over the past four years : promote our values , protect our interests , defend our friends and bring to justice those who would do @entity112 harm			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 .			0
