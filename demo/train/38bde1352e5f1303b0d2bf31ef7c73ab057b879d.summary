-- what has the popular @entity1 done now ? a woman in @entity5 says the pope called her monday and told her she could receive @entity7 , despite being married to a divorced man , reports say			1
according to the woman and her husband , the pope allegedly said , " there are some priests who are more papist than the pope " -- referring to the parish priest who refused to give @entity7 to the woman			1
the @entity17 initially refused to comment , but @entity0 received confirmation of the phone call from a @entity17 press office spokesman on wednesday			2
on thursday , the @entity17 released a statement responding to the media attention saying the content of the pope 's personal phone calls " can not be confirmed as reliable , and is a source of misunderstanding and confusion			1
" the defensiveness of the pope 's pr handlers hints of a cleanup			0
it 's true that @entity1 has earned the nickname the " cold - calling pope " for his practice of picking up the phone and calling everyday folks ( although there has been at least one hoax about a papal phone call )			1
the story did , however , start with a @entity44 post and went from @entity5 to @entity45 to @entity46 before being picked up by @entity48 news agencies			0
that 's plenty of opportunity for misinterpretation			0
if the pope were to counsel a @entity56 in this way , it would be significant			0
the @entity58 officially teaches that marriage is for life and that couples who divorce are still married in the eyes of the church unless they receive an annulment -- a process that literally nullifies the first marriage			1
( reports do not indicate whether the man 's first marriage was annulled , but it 's unlikely since the couple say they were married civilly			2
) the church 's position is based on @entity77 ' teachings in the @entity78 equating marriage after divorce with adultery			2
@entity82 , many of whom have been less than thrilled with the new pope during the first year of his papacy , are not happy with the latest news			0
one @entity56 blogger insists the story must not be true			0
of course , as the representative of the magisterium ( or teaching authority ) of the church , the pope is expected to toe the party line on church teaching -- especially in public			1
and he should have the media savvy to know that private conversations often go viral			0
on the other hand , more liberal @entity82 are hopeful , given speculation that pastoral practices toward divorced and remarried @entity82 may change after a worldwide meeting of bishops in october			2
@entity106 bishops , especially cardinal @entity107 , have long lobbied for relaxing the rules that bar @entity82 in so - called " irregular " marriages from the sacraments			2
in the @entity48 , the rule -- much like the one against artificial birth control -- is routinely ignored by most @entity82			0
despite all the brouhaha , this phone conversation was actually a private one , between " @entity115 " -- as the pope allegedly identified himself -- and the woman			1
he also would n't be the first @entity56 priest to privately tell a divorced person to go ahead and receive @entity7			1
even if he is the pope , such a private conversation does not automatically change centuries of church teaching , as the most recent @entity124 statement points out			1
yet it 's true that the pope has also publicly called for more pastoral sensitivity and inclusiveness not only toward the divorced and remarried , but also toward gay and lesbian @entity82 , single parents and others			2
there 's a reason his new book is called " @entity134			0
" it 's too early to tell if this is the pope 's way of asserting his position on a possible change in pastoral practice or even church teaching			1
still , it could be a lot more significant than his more symbolic gestures , such as eschewing red shoes and letting kids ride in the popemobile			0
since it 's the @entity151 season , i 'll remain hopeful .			0

reports that @entity1 told woman married to divorced man that taking @entity7 ok
@entity156 : @entity17 *backing* away , but if true , pope may signal *softening* on divorce rule
some *prelates* have lobbied to relax rules barring divorced from sacraments
@entity156 : private conversation with @entity1 does n't automatically change church teaching
