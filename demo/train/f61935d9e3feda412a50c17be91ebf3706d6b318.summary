a new possibility for a diplomatic solution in the standoff between @entity3 and the @entity4 surfaced unexpectedly monday as the war - torn country said it supported a proposal to hand over control of its chemical weapons			1
but a key question loomed : is that a viable option or simply a stall tactic as president @entity16 's government tries to stave off @entity4 military action ? " it 's certainly a positive development when the @entity23 and @entity3 both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons , " president @entity18 told @entity20 's @entity19 monday			1
asked whether the proposed idea was enough to avert a military strike on @entity3 , @entity18 said , " it 's possible if it 's real			1
" the @entity4 president spoke hours after @entity3 foreign minister @entity32 told reporters in @entity34 that his nation " welcomes " a proposal that @entity23 foreign minister @entity37 made during talks on monday			1
the idea : put @entity3 's chemical weapons under international control to avert a @entity4 military response over an alleged poison gas attack last month			1
" i declare that the @entity3 welcomes @entity23 's initiative , on the basis that the @entity3 leadership cares about the lives of our citizens and the security in our country , " @entity32 said			1
" we are also confident in the wisdom of the @entity23 government , which is trying to prevent an @entity4 aggression against our people			1
" secretary of state @entity57 discussed a similar scenario earlier monday , though the @entity59 later said that @entity16 could not be trusted to relinquish his country 's chemical stockpiles			2
@entity63 spokesman @entity62 said @entity64 remained " highly skeptical " of the @entity3 regime			0
" the only reason why we are seeing this proposal is because of the threat of @entity4 military action , " he said			2
taking a ' hard look ' @entity18 said the @entity4 will work with @entity23 and the international community " to see if we can arrive at something that is enforceable and serious			1
" the @entity4 will take a " hard look " at the plan , deputy @entity59 spokeswoman @entity75 said			0
but " we ca n't have this be another stalling tactic , " she said , adding that the @entity3 president 's track record does n't bode well			2
" everything that @entity16 has done over the past two years and before has been to refuse to put his chemical weapons under international control , " she said			2
" he has n't declared them			0
we 've repeatedly called on him to do so			0
and he 's ignored prohibitions against them			0
" latest developments the new possibility of a diplomatic deal appeared to have started with comments from @entity57 earlier monday			2
asked whether there was anything @entity16 's government could do or offer that would stop an attack , @entity57 said that @entity16 " could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week			1
" speaking at a news conference with @entity104 foreign secretary @entity103 , the @entity4 secretary of state described that as an impossible scenario			0
" he is n't about to do it , " @entity57 said			0
" and it ca n't be done , obviously			0
" @entity4 official : @entity57 " clearly went off script " but as @entity23 and @entity3 later suggested that it could be done , one @entity4 official called @entity57 's remarks a " major goof , " adding that @entity4 's top diplomat " clearly went off script			1
" " there is no one in the administration who is taking this @entity3 proposal seriously , " the official said			1
several @entity59 representatives tried to clarify @entity57 's remarks later in the day , calling them a " rhetorical argument			1
" " his point was that this brutal dictator ( @entity16 ) with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts can not be trusted to turn over chemical weapons , otherwise he would have done so long ago , " @entity59 spokeswoman @entity121 said			2
" that 's why the world faces this moment			0
" @entity57 's comments caught @entity23 's attention it was n't long before the remarks came up in a conversation between @entity37 and @entity57 , who talked on the phone as the @entity4 secretary of state flew back from @entity137			1
" i saw your comments this morning , " @entity37 said to @entity57 , according to a senior @entity59 official			2
during a 14 - minute conversation that had been previously scheduled , the @entity23 foreign minister said he would speak out about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table , the official said			2
@entity57 told @entity37 that the @entity4 " is not going to ' play games , ' " the official said			1
" if there is a serious proposal , we will take a look			0
" @entity154 weighs in could ' goof ' be solution ? the comments from @entity57 and counterparts in @entity23 and @entity3 are the latest twist in an international crisis that has also become a fierce political battle in the @entity4			1
the @entity18 administration says the @entity16 government was behind an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity164			2
and the @entity4 president is seeking congressional approval for a military strike in response			1
so far he 's met resistance from lawmakers and the public who are concerned about the @entity4 again intervening militarily in a foreign crisis			0
on monday , @entity75 said looking at the @entity23 proposal does n't mean the @entity63 is backing down from its push to get authorization to strike @entity3			1
" in fact , the opposite			0
we think this is why it 's even more important that @entity182 votes to authorize the president to use military action against @entity3 regime targets , because we can be clear that if we do n't give authorization to do so and we do n't respond , then @entity16 will see that as a green light to continue using these chemical weapons			1
" but could @entity57 's possible gaffe be the key to a diplomatic solution ? commentator @entity192 says he hopes so			1
" we have the possibility of two things : that @entity23 might actually act decisively to rein @entity16 in , and also support the only viable policy to accomplish what @entity18 wants -- protecting the world from these vile weapons , " @entity192 wrote monday			0
" i have no idea whether this is a serious move by @entity37 -- but it sure seems so , and it presents a fascinating non-binary option			0
... sometimes , it seems , @entity57 's incompetence strikes gold			1
" whatever happens , the prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the @entity18 administration 's attempts to make a case before @entity182 even more difficult , said @entity208 , a senior fellow at the @entity209			0
lawmakers who are already debating whether or not to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them , he said			0
" it 's going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things , " he said			0
there 's already been at least one delay			0
senate majority leader @entity221 is holding off on taking steps toward a first vote			0
an aide said that the @entity23 proposal is serious and fluid enough that members do not want to lock themselves into a position on @entity3 just yet			2
an initial @entity229 vote on whether to authorize a military strike against @entity3 had been expected on wednesday			1
reaction in the @entity4 , beyond @entity233 foreign minister @entity232 said the @entity23 proposal " deserves a thorough examination			2
" it would be acceptable under several conditions , @entity232 said			0
@entity238 should immediately hand over control of the weapons and allow their destruction , he said , calling for the @entity243 to pass a binding resolution with " firm consequences			0
" " since the beginning , @entity233 has set two goals : punishment and deterrence , " he said			0
" that is why we are now asking specific , rapid and verifiable commitments by the @entity3 regime			0
" sen. @entity254 , chairwoman of the @entity255 , said she would " welcome " @entity37 's call for @entity3 to transfer control of its chemical weapons " to prevent an international strike			1
" " i believe that @entity23 can be most effective in encouraging the @entity3 president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions , as well as storage facilities , under @entity268 control until they can be destroyed , " the @entity261 @entity260 said			1
former @entity4 secretary of state @entity154 said getting @entity3 to surrender the stockpiles " would be an important step			2
" " but this can not be another excuse for delay or obstruction , " @entity271 said during an event at the @entity63 monday			0
" and @entity23 has to support the international community 's efforts sincerely or be held to account			0
" @entity268 chief : chemical weapons in @entity3 would be ' abominable '			1

a @entity229 vote on @entity3 is delayed in light of @entity23 's proposal
@entity23 made proposal as @entity4 considers military strike for alleged chemical weapons use
@entity57 said @entity3 's president could prevent a strike by taking that step
@entity4 official : @entity57 's comments on @entity3 were a " major goof "
