-- @entity1 is a chameleon			1
and a busy one , too			0
@entity1 has made his name with well - crafted songs in a variety of styles			1
listeners to his first album , 1998 's " @entity10 , " may have lumped him into the alt - country movement			2
aside from @entity1 's rough , intimate voice , that album sounds little like 2003 's " 1972 , " which features songs such as " @entity15 " and " comeback ( @entity17 ) " and has a funkier , more upbeat production to match			1
the 36 - year - old singer 's willingness to follow several paths may have come from moving around as a child			1
@entity1 was born in @entity23 and grew up around the @entity24 and the @entity25			1
" it really shaped me as a person , " he told the @entity26 " there 's an openness to the sound that i think i got from moving to , say , a big city in @entity32 to a @entity34 town of five or six hundred			2
" though he has yet to have a breakthrough single in the @entity37 , his music has appeared in the movie " @entity42 " and tv shows including " @entity40 " and " @entity41			1
" he 's also admired by fellow songwriters			1
in 2004 , the @entity45 newspaper the ( @entity47 ) age noted @entity1 was going to have dinner with @entity49 , the " @entity51 " singer who is married to @entity50			1
" she called me and said , ' i love " 1972 , " ' and i was like , ' i was listening to you when i was 16 -- and you 're married to @entity50 ! ' " @entity1 told the paper			1
on the business side , he 's marching to his own drummer			2
on joshrouse.com , @entity1 's web site , he sells his " @entity59 " -- dozens of songs @entity61 recorded live or in random locations ( hotel rooms , apartments ) available to fans			1
for those who like a more traditional medium , the cd , @entity69 recently compiled a two - disc set of @entity1 's material -- including several demos and outtakes -- for " @entity74 , " which covers the first seven years of @entity1 's career			1
" listening to this collection of tracks taken ... it 's plain that @entity1 arrived fully formed , " writes @entity77 's @entity76			1
" from his first release ... he was already a thoughtful writer with a heartbreakingly intimate voice and the unfailing ability to wrap his melancholy in warm and sweet melodies			0
" @entity1 answered several questions via e-mail for @entity0			2
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity0 : your music showcases a number of styles -- the fairly basic sound of the early records , the early - ' 70s infused stuff from " 1972 , " and then there are songs like " @entity101 " that would sound comfortable coming from @entity102 or @entity103			2
so , though it 's a clich√© , what are your influences ? @entity1 : anything that is soulful and honest is an influence			1
there are too many musicians / writers to name			0
@entity0 : are you surprised that @entity69 put together a " best of " ? @entity1 : no , i was aware that they were planning on doing it			2
it 's nice to reflect on the body of work i 've created			0
@entity0 : one of your songs , " directions , " was on the " @entity42 " soundtrack			0
what effect , if any , did this have on your career ? @entity1 : well , i got to meet @entity127 , and he seemed nice			2
i 'm sure it exposed my music to some people who might not of heard it otherwise			0
however , it did not have a @entity134 effect on my career			0
@entity0 : with all the material on the @entity138 , as well as your albums , you 're obviously a prolific songwriter			0
has it been helpful to put all that out there , or have some people criticized you for releasing too much , as @entity144 has been criticized ? @entity1 : more than being criticized for releasing a lot , i think it 's more difficult to receive a lot of attention for one specific record			1
sometimes [ the ] press does n't want to write on a songwriter they just wrote about a year or two ago			0
i think my fan base is grateful			0
@entity0 : which of your songs are among your favorites , and why ? which would you like to have back -- or rework ? @entity1 : " 1972 " is a beautiful song all the way around			1
i do n't think i ever want to rework anything			0
i 'm constantly trying to move forward			0
sometimes you say , " i wish that was faster , etc. " but it i 'm not going to go back and re-record it			0
@entity0 : in the album notes , you mention that you write best when you 're in motion -- getting ideas for melodies in taxicabs , for example			0
how do you hold on to those ? @entity1 : if they 're good , i can usually remember them			2
i also have a variety of small handheld recorders			0
@entity0 : you 've got songs referring to @entity23 , the @entity177 , @entity178 ... have you thought of pulling a @entity179 and profiling a state ? @entity1 : no , and i 'm not sure half of those @entity179 songs are profiling a state			1
however , it makes for a great marketing tool			0
@entity0 : you say you feel as if these albums are your " first stage			0
" what 's next ? @entity1 : i 'm currently working on an @entity189 record in @entity190 .			1

@entity1 has fans among other songwriters
" @entity15 " singer has no hits , but songs in tv shows , movies
what 's next ? " @entity189 record in @entity190 "
