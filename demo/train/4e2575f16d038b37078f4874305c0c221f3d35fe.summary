@entity0 -- the @entity2 is scrambling to meet a federal court 's thursday deadline to answer fundamental constitutional questions dealing with the health care law championed by president @entity7 , an escalating political battle that has embroiled all three branches of government			1
administration officials said wednesday they were deciding how to respond to an order from a three - judge appeals panel hearing a separate challenge to the @entity15			1
department lawyers were told to explain whether federal courts could intervene and strike down congressional laws as unconstitutional			2
such a power has been guaranteed since the @entity21 's landmark 1803 ruling in @entity22			1
this came after a federal judge appeared to be deeply concerned by the president 's comments this week , in which he challenged the high court not to take what he called an " unprecedented " step of overturning the law			1
the @entity32 tried to defuse the ideological firestorm , saying president @entity7 's words were misunderstood			2
the three judges are @entity37 appointees from the 5th @entity38 , meeting in @entity39			0
they were hearing a challenge to the health care law from physician - owned hospitals , despite the fact the @entity21 is deciding the constitutional questions			1
the high court 's rulings expected in june would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals			1
the latest dispute surfaced monday when the president said , " i 'm confident that the @entity21 will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected @entity57 and i just remind conservative commentators that for years , what we 've heard is , the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint , that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law			1
" some conservative commentators accused the president of trying to " bully " the federal courts into backing the law , or risk attacks on their credibility			0
a day after the president 's remarks , the federal appeals court held its open hearing			1
judge @entity79 , a @entity80 appointee , was especially tough on a @entity2 lawyer defending the law , specifically mentioning the @entity7 quotes			1
" i 'm referring to statements by the president in the past few days to the effect , and i 'm sure you 've heard about them , that it is somehow inappropriate for what he termed ' unelected ' judges to strike acts of @entity57 that have enjoyed -- he was referring to , of course , @entity15 -- to what he termed broad consensus in majorities in both houses of @entity57 , " said @entity79			1
" that has troubled a number of people who have read it as somehow a challenge to the federal courts or to their authority or to the appropriateness of the concept of judicial review , " he continued			1
" and that 's not a small matter			0
so i want to be sure that you 're telling us that the attorney general and the @entity2 do recognize the authority of the federal courts through unelected judges to strike acts of @entity57 or portions thereof in appropriate cases			1
government lawyer @entity117 appeared initially taken aback , but replied such authority has existed for centuries			0
nevertheless , @entity79 and judges @entity120 and @entity121 then ordered the @entity2 to submit by noon thursday a three - page , single - spaced letter addressing whether the @entity7 administration believes courts do indeed enjoy that power			1
@entity79 's phrasing in open court of the law as " @entity15 " mirrors a term used by many opponents of the law			1
the specific issue before the appeals court was a provision in the law restricting doctor - owned hospitals from expanding their facilities			2
the challenge was brought by an @entity140 spine - and - joint hospital in @entity140			2
just hours after the appeals court hearing , @entity7 on tuesday clarified his earlier statements , saying , " the point i was making is that the @entity21 is the final say on our @entity145 and our laws , and all of us have to respect it , but it 's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature , our @entity57			1
and so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this			0
" @entity32 press secretary @entity157 , facing a flurry of reporter questions , said the president was articulating the view the high court has for 80 years generally deferred to congressional authority , specifically on economic legislation based on the @entity145 's @entity165 , and was not challenging the @entity21			1
" it 's the reverse of intimidation , he 's simply making an observation about the fact that he expects the court to adhere to that precedent , " he said			2
" it 's obviously , as he made clear yesterday , up to the court to make its determination , and we will wait and see that the court does			2
" attorney general @entity177 defended the president			0
" i think that you know what the president said a couple of days ago was appropriate , " said @entity177 , speaking at a health care fraud prevention event in @entity180			0
" i do n't think he broke any new ground in the comments that he made			0
" there was criticism aimed at both @entity7 and the federal courts over the divisive political issue			0
senate minority leader @entity191 accused the administration of trying to " browbeat " and " intimidate " the justices			0
" the president , more than anyone else , has an obligation to uphold the legitimacy of our judicial system , " said the @entity194 @entity37			0
" but his remarks on the [ @entity21 ] @entity21 reflect not only an attempt to influence the outcome , but a preview of @entity206 attacks to come if they do n't get their way			2
" @entity209 , chief counsel of the @entity210 , said president @entity7 was out of bounds			0
" the president is tying to bully the court here , threatening them that if they do n't come down his way , they 're going to have the same thing that happened in the @entity219 address 2010			0
he 's going to be calling them activists , he 's going to be saying they 're political			0
" the president two years ago attacked the conservative majority for striking down a campaign finance reform law , giving corporations greater power to spend in federal elections			0
but some conservative legal sources privately expressed disappointment in the appeals court 's order , saying it appeared punitive and petty to demand the @entity2 defend a position it had never disputed in court			1
" it was like he [ the judge ] was giving a homework assignment to an unprepared student , " said one right - leaning lawyer , who opposed the law			2
" it has the effect of putting the judiciary on the defensive , and could give rise to concerns the courts will look at the law from a political , not constitutional perspective			2
" the high court held three days of oral arguments last week , dealing with four major questions surrounding the health care law			1
the justices have not , and by custom will not , comment on pending appeals			0
their written opinions due in the next three months will be the final word on the @entity15 's constitutionality , particularly the " individual mandate " provision that requires most @entity263 to have health insurance by 2014 , or face a financial penalty			1
the outcome of the cases have raised the stakes in a presidential year , and could have a lasting effect on the credibility of the federal courts , which are supposed to be beyond policies			0
" i think what we are seeing here is the courts , and the confrontation between the administration and the courts , being drawn in to overall polarization that defines so much of modern political life			2
every aspect of this has been extraordinary , " said @entity284 , a @entity1 political analyst			0
" @entity7 's comments monday were more pointed and sharp than a president usually directs toward the @entity21 ; the response by a @entity80 - appointed judge , more pointed and sharp than you might have expected from a lifetime - tenured member of the judiciary			1
and you really see here how even the idea of the court as something of an island apart from the intensity of political conflict is really breaking down			0
