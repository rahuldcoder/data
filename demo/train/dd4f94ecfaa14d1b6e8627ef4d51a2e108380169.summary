-- @entity1 is finally paying off for @entity2			1
one of the most naturally gifted golfers in the world , he feels he is now closer to fulfilling his promise after clinching the " biggest win " of his career in circumstances that might previously have proved too testing			2
the big - hitting 29 - year - old claimed the $ 1.2 million first prize at the @entity11 in @entity12 on sunday , winning his first @entity14 title by three shots after a sizzling finish			1
next , he hopes , is the holy grail of any player -- a win at one of the four majors			2
" this is the biggest win of my career and hopefully there are better things to come			2
a major is always the next step , " the @entity26 told reporters			1
" am i suited best for one or the other ? i do n't think so			2
i think they all suit me very well			2
if i play like i did this week , i 'm going to win one for sure			0
" i grew up right down the street from @entity34 ( venue for april 's masters ) , so that would be my favorite one			0
i just love playing that golf course			0
" @entity2 has already gone close twice , having led by three shots going into the final round of the @entity42 before blowing up and then missing out on a playoff at the following year 's @entity44 after getting a two - shot penalty at the last hole			1
in @entity47 , where he was chased by defending champion @entity48 and @entity49 -- the man who overhauled him to win at @entity51 three years ago -- he also had a three - shot lead			1
but it was gone inside two holes as he three - putted his first and @entity48 began with two birdies			1
however , @entity2 is mentally stronger these days and he tussled for the lead with @entity48 before chipping in for an eagle at 16 that put him two clear of the @entity59 , and then picking up another shot at 17 before parring the final hole -- which he had double - bogeyed on saturday			1
" it takes a while to learn , " @entity2 said of his newfound maturity , having carded a second successive six - under - par 66 to clinch his second @entity64 title this year and first of the new 2013 - 14 season			1
" i wish i would have had some of that a few times a few years ago , but you learn from your mistakes and try to get better from them			0
" i think i showed a lot of patience and a lot of discipline with clubs i picked and shot selection			0
" @entity48 , who also closed with 66 after a 63 on saturday , moved up to fourth in the @entity80 's race to @entity82 standings -- @entity14 events , like majors , count for points on both main circuits			1
" i guess it was a good defense , " the 37 - year - old said			0
" obviously i 'm a little disappointed not to put my hands back on the trophy , but 15 birdies and an eagle at the weekend is some pretty good golf			0
" i 'm in great form			0
i really am playing well			0
the work i 've done leading up to this run of tournaments has really worked and i could n't be hitting it any better right now			0
" @entity49 was third , another shot back on 20 - under 268 , as he trimmed @entity101 's race to @entity82 lead ahead of next week 's third event in the final series in @entity104			1
the @entity105 , who won the @entity64 's @entity106 in september , finished tied for 31st at @entity107 after a closing 65			0
@entity49 paid tribute to @entity2 , who is a key member of the @entity26 @entity110 team			1
" @entity2 was in a different league off the tee and gave us a little bit of a sniff -- and then promptly slammed the door , " the @entity111 said			1
" he 's just a quality , talented , very athletic , classy player			0
yeah , he makes mistakes			0
but when you 've got a game as good as him , you can get away with a few mistakes			0
he 's got a great wedge game to go with an outrageously good driving game			0
" @entity127 's @entity126 was fourth on 18 under after shooting the day 's equal - best round , a flawless nine - birdie 63			2
@entity26 open champion @entity129 was two shots back after a 68 , just ahead of former world no. 1 @entity133 and @entity135 's @entity134 ( both 69 )			1
@entity136 and @entity137 were tied for eighth with @entity139 , just ahead of @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 in 11th equal			2
@entity26 veteran @entity143 was 14th after the @entity145 titleholder carded 65 .			1

@entity2 wins the @entity11 tournament by three strokes sunday
@entity26 loses lead in first two holes of final round but plays last six in five under par
defending champion @entity48 finishes second ahead of @entity49
