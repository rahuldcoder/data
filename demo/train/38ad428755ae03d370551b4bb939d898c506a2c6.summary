-- it 's hard to engineer this kind of creepy serendipity			0
earlier this week , @entity5 data watchdogs , fighting to protect our privacy in an age of big data , put pressure on @entity11 over the privacy of user information			1
just 48 hours later , @entity11 potentially struck a new blow against privacy when it posted a video preview of its new " @entity24 " technology -- high - tech spectacles featuring a revolutionary digital interface that enable its wearers to not only view the world through @entity11 's eyes but also automatically photograph all that they see			1
" how strange is that ! " @entity0 's @entity26 exclaimed after a contemplating a " world seen through @entity24 "			2
but these glasses , a kind of digital surrogate for our eyes , are strange in a creepy , hitchcockian , " @entity35 " sort of way			0
or the same way that @entity37 's ubiquitous cameras were strange in @entity40 's " @entity39			0
" and in the same way that a future in which " promethean " data companies like @entity11 rule the world now appears strange			1
the coincidental timing of last week 's @entity5 and @entity11 announcements may have been unintentional , but it sure is ominous			2
read related : how it will feel to wear @entity24 the @entity5 is concerned about the way in which @entity11 has , since last march , been pooling the data of its individual users across its popular services like search , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 in order to bundle them up for advertisers			1
its anxiety over this aggregation of our personal information is twofold			0
firstly , @entity11 has done little , if anything , to inform users of this unilateral change			2
secondly , @entity11 has n't offered users a way of opting out			2
@entity11 insists its privacy policies respect @entity71 laws and simply help enhance user experiences			1
but in the eyes of the @entity5 , those of us using products like @entity56 , @entity54 or @entity55 are being , to borrow a @entity78 coined neologism , " scroogled " by @entity11 's new privacy policy			1
last october , @entity5 watchdogs gave @entity11 four months to revise this policy			2
but last week , after nothing appeared to have changed , @entity82 raised its warning a bureaucratic notch , promising to take action against @entity11 by the summer			2
and yet , in light of @entity24 , the @entity5 's concerns seem like a quaint throwback to a more innocent digital age			1
watchdogs should , of course , be barking madly at @entity11 's decision to pool our data for its advertising clients			1
regardless of the legitimacy of such practices , i 'm strongly in favor of making @entity11 accountable , both legally and morally , for policies that so patently disregard the privacy of its users			1
but @entity24 opens an entirely new front in the digital war against privacy			1
these spectacles , which have been specifically designed to record everything we see , represent a developmental leap in the history of data that is comparable to moving from the bicycle to the automobile			1
it is the sort of radical transformation that may actually end up completely destroying our individual privacy in the digital 21st century			2
read related : from 3d graphics to biometric scans : how your smartphone will get smarter while none of us were looking , @entity11 -- the most data - hungry of today 's digital giants -- is reengineering mobile technology			1
thanks to @entity130 's mad rush to develop wearable computing , it is n't alone			0
@entity132 is supposedly working on its hotly - anticipated wristwatch and wearable personal data devices from companies like @entity136 and @entity137 are already beginning to revolutionize the healthcare industry			0
but there 's something particularly troubling about @entity24			2
when we put on these surveillance devices , we all become spies , or scrooglers , of everything and everyone around us			0
by getting us to wear their all seeing digital eyeglasses , @entity11 are metamorphosing us into human versions of those @entity151 vans -- now thankfully banned in @entity152 -- which crawl , like giant cockroaches , around our cities documenting our homes			1
neither @entity40 nor @entity156 at their most terrifyingly dystopian could have dreamt up @entity24			2
according to @entity11 co-founder @entity162 , quoted by tech website @entity164 , " @entity24 will also have an automatic picture - taking mode , snapping pics at a preset intervals ( such as every 5 seconds )			1
" pics every 5 seconds ! gulp			0
so where will all that intimate data go ? @entity26 's strange " world seen through @entity24 " is actually , as another leading tech site @entity168 notes " the world seen through @entity11 's omnipresent eye			1
" and the terabytes of data sucked up every five seconds by its omniscient glasses will , of course , flow to @entity11			1
that 's the whole business model , the very raison d'etre of @entity24			0
those pics every 5 seconds will be used to aggregate data and then to generate billions of dollars of revenue by selling advertising around it			0
one @entity5 complaint about current @entity11 practice , you 'll remember , was about the absence of an opt out button to enable users to say no to @entity11 's pooling of their data			1
but the problem of saying no , of opting out , becomes even more problematic with @entity24			0
after all , as these @entity195 or @entity196 - designed devices become more fashionable ( ie : innocuous ) , most of us wo n't even know if we are being filmed when gazed at by a bespectacled stranger			0
in pictures : 12 futuristic phone concepts the @entity5 watchdogs also objected to @entity11 's current pooling of our data in a single personalized record			1
and @entity24 could , i fear , become the focal point for all our data in a world where privacy no longer exists			1
" everything , from @entity11 searches to notifications to hangouts , seemingly happens in this one space , " notes @entity168 about the spectacles			2
@entity24 , thus , may become the pivotal post pc , post @entity217 and post tablet device			0
a pooling of all our most intimate data , a mirror of ourselves -- the holy grail , of course , for advertisers			0
i remarked earlier that it 's hard to engineer this creepy kind of serendipity			0
but i may have been wrong			0
you see , the whole point of @entity24 is actually to successfully engineer serendipity			0
the creepier , the better			0
after all , when we wear these devices , those clever engineers at @entity11 will know where we are all the time			0
so what 's to stop them serving up personalized advertisements for products when the gaze of our glasses rest upon those products ? at the very moment we look at those new clothes in that store window , a special offer for the clothes will flash up on the digital interface of our @entity24			2
how serendipitous , eh ? but what to do ? is there an antidote to @entity11 's eyewear ? @entity24 is currently in being tested with plans for a finished product to be released into the mass market next year			1
last week , @entity11 announced that a few prototype models of the spectacles would go on sale for the not exactly bargain price of $ 1,500			2
to qualify , well - heeled @entity11 fanboys need to go to their @entity55 or @entity260 accounts and , in 50 words or less , using the hashtag # ifihadglass , explain how they would use @entity24			1
so , if anyone at @entity11 happens to be reading this , here 's my application : # ifihadglass : i would make data privacy its default feature			1
nobody else sees the data i see unless i explicitly say so			0
not advertisers , nor the government , and certainly not those engineers of the human soul at the @entity277			0
no , @entity24 must be opaque			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity281 .			0

@entity24 spectacles could offer tech giant new ways of *harvesting* data , says @entity281
@entity281 argues that @entity24 raises further concerns over the way @entity11 treats our private data
wearing spectacles that record our every move could be the end of privacy as we know it , he says
