@entity0 -- he wants you to have a good night 's rest at a good price			1
@entity6 , ceo of @entity7 @entity6 is the ceo of @entity7 , the world 's largest hotel chain , with more than 4,000 locations around the globe			1
a company man by nature , his management style is as smooth as the fresh linens on the beds			2
at the @entity7 in @entity0 's historic @entity17 , he tells the boardroom about the difference he sees between the high and low ends of the hotel market			2
@entity23 : what 's your memory of the first time you stayed in a hotel ? @entity6 : well , that 's easy , because when i grew up in @entity32 my parents used to take me to hotels , and back in the ' 50s and ' 60s the hotels are where people went for nice dinners or nice brunches			2
and that 's my childhood memory and that 's why i am actually in the hotel business -- from those memories			1
@entity23 : you are in the service industry , where customer satisfaction is so important			2
how do you keep your employees motivated ? @entity6 : i think the most important thing is to really care about the employees that work for you			1
i started in the business being a busboy and dishwasher , so i have a special appreciation for people in those jobs			1
but i have also been a housekeeper to clean rooms , i have been a front - desk clerk , i 've been a @entity60 operator			2
i 've done all those jobs , and it helped me understand that those positions are really important , they are the backbones of the company			0
@entity23 : how would you describe your management philosophy now , though ? @entity6 : you know , i learned a lot throughout the years from the time when i was growing up -- my mom and dad had tremendous work ethic			1
they worked very long work hours , they were very dedicated for their work , so when i was growing up i was instilled with that work ethic			1
i believe in hard work , i believe in being dedicated to whatever you do			1
and when i was going to high school , i went to a @entity82 high school , and what they taught me was the thirst for knowledge , curiosity , and always reinventing yourself , the need to always improve			0
@entity23 : what do you gives think @entity7 an edge over the competitors ? and who do you see as your biggest competitor ? @entity6 : all the discount brands are competitive			0
@entity7 really straddles across the whole spectrum of the mid-scale market			0
what we are really different about is we are not a @entity100 , we do n't take the same approach to building our hotels			1
@entity7 hotels are independently owned and operated , what that means is when you check in to someone 's hotel , you are really checking in to someone 's home			0
there 's a whole sense of hospitality			0
because our members are the owners of the hotels			0
and they want to care for you as their guest			0
@entity23 : what 's the biggest challenge for you as you look out in the next couple of years for the hotel business and for @entity7 ? @entity6 : when the economy softens and the stock market goes down , then the hotel industry suffers as a result			1
and we want to be careful about the years coming , because the economy is only softening			0
and in addition to that , because after the very good years that we had just recently , there 's been a lot of construction activities			0
there 's many more hotels coming on board , so without all the supply , we need to be careful .			0
