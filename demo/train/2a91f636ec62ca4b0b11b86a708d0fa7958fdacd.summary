@entity0 -- a day after a 75 - minute session , talks will resume monday to try to reach a deficit - reduction deal and pave the way for a hike in the nation 's $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling , a @entity3 spokesman said sunday			1
@entity3 communications director @entity11 said on his @entity13 account on sunday night that congressional leaders will return to the @entity3 for further negotiations on monday			0
at 11 a.m. that same morning , president @entity16 will hold a press conference in the @entity3 briefing room , according to his official schedule			2
these announcements are the first formal fall - out of sunday 's night talks on the subject , led by the president and involving top politicians from the @entity3 and @entity26			2
@entity3 minority leader @entity27 said afterward that @entity28 are " still hopeful for a large bipartisan agreement , " one that will do " no harm to the middle class or to economic growth ( and ) protect @entity34 and @entity35 beneficiaries			0
" @entity37 , a spokesman for @entity26 minority leader @entity38 , meanwhile said that he found it " baffling that the president and his party continue to insist on massive tax hikes in the middle of a jobs crisis			1
" those comments echoed many others made by key figures in both parties , as they posture to try get a deal that cuts into the nation 's debt			0
republicans initiated the fight when they demanded drastically reduced spending ( but no tax hikes ) before they agreed to raise the nation 's debt ceiling			1
@entity16 responded by saying he backs an ambitious plan to reach $ 4 trillion , mostly through cuts but also with revenue increases			2
if @entity62 does n't act by august 2 , the government could begin defaulting on its obligations			1
the president hinted at that sense of urgency sunday			0
when asked before the meeting 's start if a deal can be reached within 10 days , he told reporters , " we need to			0
" meanwhile , a @entity28 congressional aide said sunday 's talks produced " no breakthroughs yet , " as the president pushed still for a " grand bargain - style deal that includes revenues , like getting rid of millionaire tax breaks , while @entity52 argued it was time to lower sights to a smaller deal that relies on cuts alone			1
" a senior @entity16 administration official said the president continued to push for a " big deal , " saying he would not accept a short - term agreement or anything that in the @entity3 's view is not balanced			1
as he has said previously , he challenged congressional leader to step up and do something substantial			0
an aide to house speaker @entity93 , meanwhile , said the @entity94 @entity52 countered by saying he wanted a deal that was based on previously discussed budget cuts outlined by a bipartisan group led by vice president @entity98			1
@entity93 had hinted at the @entity52 's strategy on saturday evening , when he issued a statement saying that his party cohorts could not support a major deal as long as @entity16 and @entity28 insist on increasing taxes			1
he said that any such revenue - raising initiative would prevent the bulk of @entity52 from supporting a more ambitious deal , even if it was one including cutting spending and reforming entitlement programs such as @entity34			2
the @entity3 speaker said , as a result , that the talks ' parameters would be scaled back to focus on budget cuts alone			0
the @entity3 immediately pushed back , with a senior administration official saying @entity93 had initially accepted the need to increase tax rates on wealthy @entity117 as part of a deal			1
but then , the official said , @entity52 offered a different plan in the talks with @entity16 that began thursday			1
in the statement sunday night , the @entity93 aide insisted that @entity16 " agreed with the speaker that their previous talks did not produce any agreement			1
" @entity16 believes " it is time to solve this problem , " @entity3 chief of staff @entity129 said on @entity133 's " @entity134 " program sunday			2
he added that @entity16 's " call to the ( congressional ) leaders is to step up and be leaders			0
" the @entity137 has warned that failure to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a default , which could push interest rates to skyrocket and cause the dollar to plummet			1
but @entity52 , including those controlling the @entity3 , have said they 'll block any such move without substantial budget cuts			0
a @entity117 default on its debt obligations would have " real nasty consequences " for the @entity117 and the global economy , the new director of the @entity147 said in an interview broadcast sunday			1
" it would jeopardize the stability at large , " @entity153 , who last week became the first woman to head the global financial institution , told @entity133			0
still , such warnings did n't prevent party leaders on sunday talk shows from reverting back to time - tested talking points that suggested the two sides were still far from an agreement			2
" what is really appalling is to see our @entity52 colleagues essentially providing a form of extortion -- if you do n't agree to deficit reduction the way we want it , we 'll put all the jobs at risk , because we will allow the @entity117 to default on its debt , " said rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , on the @entity1 show " @entity165			1
" " that 's irresponsible			0
" at the heart of the @entity52 resistance is a bedrock principle pushed by conservative crusader @entity181 against any kind of tax increase			2
a pledge pushed by @entity181 's group , @entity185 , has been signed by more than 230 @entity3 members and 40 senators , almost all of them @entity52			0
after sunday nights talks , senate majority leader @entity190 's spokesman @entity189 said that the @entity193 @entity192 wants " an approach that is balanced between spending and revenues			2
" however long it takes , he said that @entity190 is " firmly committed " to striking a deal			0
" sen. @entity190 believes the stakes are too high for republicans to keep taking the easy way out , and he is committed to meeting every day until we forge a deal , however long it takes , " said @entity189			0
@entity1 's @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
