@entity0 -- it was a one - minute spot that aired just one time , but with an ominous countdown and a mushroom cloud , @entity5 's " @entity6 " ad marked a new era in @entity11 politics			1
considered the first attack ad , the @entity6 , which turned 50 on sunday , features a little girl sweetly plucking petals from a flower as she counts her small collection out loud			1
the screen freezes and suddenly we hear an alarming voice sound off a different countdown , this time it 's one that leads to a nuclear explosion			1
without mentioning @entity5 's opponent or showing his image , the ad implies that @entity27 @entity26 is a reckless warmonger whose presidency would result in a nuclear holocaust			1
@entity31 , an advertising creative director who also teaches political ads at @entity33 , said the spot mastered the cardinal rule of advertising : get noticed			1
it engaged viewers as political ads had never done before			1
" it was an incredibly overt production , but it asked and dared people to bring their own reading to it , " he told @entity1			1
in one sense , he added , the spot is simple			1
it asked viewers to look at the girl , look at the bomb and vote for president @entity5			1
" those are the three dots to connect , but in the middle of those dots , there 's a man who might be trigger happy , " he said			1
" it was both overt and subtle at the time , which was really hard to do in a 60 - second spot			1
" the commercial , created by the advertising giant @entity58 , ran on september 7 , 1964 , during an @entity60 broadcast of " monday night at the movies			1
" @entity31 said the spot played off the widespread fear at the time of nuclear warfare ; the @entity66 happened just under two years prior			1
" it scared the hell out of me when i saw it and it still does			2
as a callow young copywriter , i loved its bravura and slash - and - burn strategy			2
as a creative director and college professor , it gives me pause , " he said			1
" but it still makes me gasp every time i see it			2
" the @entity6 set the stage for 50 more years of political ads. in his own words , @entity31 takes a look at five other spots that top his list of the most compelling ads : 1 ) " mistakes " -- 1969 -- re-elect campaign for @entity88 , mayor of @entity89 -- produced by creative personnel at @entity91			1
why i admire it : @entity96 disarms us by actually admitting mistakes as mayor			0
other than @entity101 running for governor of @entity103 and apologizing for that pesky little canceled check at an escort service , when did you ever see that happen ? the takeaway is strong : " yeah i 've screwed up , but i 've done good things and deserve re-election			0
" strong , simple , elegant filming			0
one take ; no teleprompter			0
@entity96 is in shirtsleeves , something that was n't done all that much			0
he gives a stunning delivery			0
he was reportedly 17 points down in the election before this spot ran			1
2 ) " morning in @entity11 " -- 1984 -- re-elect campaign for @entity120 -- key creative personnel : @entity122 and @entity123 ; @entity123 did the voiceover			1
why i admire it : rarely has a political commercial captured the essence of a candidate as " morning " did			1
warm , upbeat , positively aw - shucks			0
the soft , gauzy images of a wedding , firemen , veterans , kids and @entity11 flags would not be out of place in one of the great @entity139 spots			0
and @entity123 's voiceover is spot - on			1
he asks , " why would we ever go back ? " hard to come up with an answer to that one			0
3 ) " @entity144 " -- 2012 -- @entity145 ( super @entity146 ) why i admire it : when everybody zigs by screaming and attacking and flashing cheesy quotes and graphics , you zag by whispering			0
that 's what this commercial does			2
a family around a table			0
@entity158 , dad , two kids			0
they pick at their food			0
a few glances are exchanged			0
all you hear is a little fall of rain and the flatware clinking against the plates			0
no music , no voiceover , no nothing			0
a title comes up and reminds us how bad the employment rate is			0
take away : these people are hungry and sad because of @entity179 's poor economic policy			2
a powerful spot for its silence			2
4 ) " 47 % " -- 2012 -- @entity179 for @entity11 -- @entity182 and partners why i admire it : there were a number of strong spots , on both sides , in 2012			0
some of the best were in the @entity27 primary before @entity191 was nominated			0
@entity192 ran two memorable spots " @entity194 " and " @entity195			0
" but this spot aced them all			2
it takes @entity191 's embarrassingly smug words to a group of fat - cat donors and morphed them into suicidal missiles			2
when @entity182 adds @entity205 - quality portraits of the people @entity191 was dismissing , it 's a devastatingly clear : he does n't care about you , why should you care about him ? 5 ) " @entity208 " -- 2014 -- @entity209 ( super pac ) why i admire it : this ad attacks sen. @entity213 , @entity214 , for being closely attached to the @entity179 agenda , especially health care			1
it 's a wonderfully produced snarky message			2
the filming , lighting , casting and set are all @entity222 and the double whammy at the end ( the little girl spells @entity213 " @entity228 - a - @entity227 " and the three adult judges respond , in a chorus , " close enough ! " ) is unforgettable			0
i would n't be surprised to see @entity209 " franchise " this spot and adapt it for any state where they can @entity233 the @entity234 to @entity179 .			2

the " @entity6 " spot by @entity5 's campaign aired 50 years *ago*
