-- a decade ago , tiny " travel - size " shampoos were fun stocking stuffers and a more expensive , more convenient means of packing toiletries for a trip			0
now they 're a reminder of the layered security landscape that has evolved at airports since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			2
as the 10 - year anniversary of that day approaches , @entity0 asked security experts to weigh in on changes in aviation security in the @entity16 since 9/11 and to offer a glimpse of what 's likely to happen next			1
the good news for the widely criticized @entity20 ? some security analysts like where the agency is headed			1
" the @entity20 is exhibiting much more open - mindedness and has already accepted the concept that there is a need to look at people as well as what they carry , " said @entity24 , president of @entity26 - based @entity25 and former head of security of @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			1
but despite all the hassles travelers now endure to get on an airplane , two experts ' picks for the decade 's most significant safety improvements had nothing to do with checkpoint screening			1
they were reinforced cockpit doors and the screening of checked luggage for explosives			1
so how do all the other measures -- the ones that aggravate the shoeless , jacket-less masses -- hold up in security analysts ' eyes ? " the past 10 years were mostly wasted by consistently holding to the idea that we can solve the problem by technological screening only , " @entity24 said			1
body scanners , metal detectors and pat - downs have limitations and responding to recent threats by having passengers remove shoes or carry only small amounts of liquid does n't make sense , analysts say			1
" try to anticipate the future , rather than reacting to the past , " said @entity70 , director of terrorism , espionage and security studies at @entity74			2
" just to do things based on something that already happened in and of itself is frankly illogical and is not supportive of good security , " he said			2
@entity20 administrator @entity80 , who took the helm in 2010 , gets credit from security experts for a shift in strategy			1
@entity80 , a former deputy director for the @entity86 , has said intelligence is the best tool for preventing terrorism , and the agency is testing measures at airports that it hopes will make things easier for most travelers			0
" we are working on a risk - based security initiative that recognizes that the vast majority of travelers are not terrorists , " @entity80 said			1
@entity100 recently announced a pilot trusted traveler program to reduce screening hassles for travelers who provide additional personal information to the government and free more resources to focus on high - risk passengers			1
the program is expected to launch in october			0
" the p word " the path to a more effective and efficient , intelligence - driven system is not easy			0
profiling , or " the @entity109 " as @entity24 referred to it , should be part of that path , according to many security analysts			1
but that concept , and some of the physical means of screening , have opponents who invoke that other " @entity109 " -- privacy			2
everyone profiles , consciously or unconsciously , @entity70 said			0
and there 's nothing " unusual or unnatural " about it			0
" the question is does it work , the scientific part , and is it consistent with our values or not ? and there 's always a tradeoff between the two			0
" they 're not calling for illegal racial or ethnic profiling , @entity70 , @entity24 and security analyst @entity130 said			1
" ( that 's ) the lazy and the easy way to go about it and the nonprofessional way , " @entity24 said			0
the profiling he supports uses legitimate information to identify what does n't make sense -- flying one - way with no luggage , for example			1
@entity130 , president of @entity143 and a former security director at @entity145 , helped develop a profiling system called @entity147 ( @entity147 ) used by the airlines before 9/11			1
" it did n't look for the bad guy , it looked for the knowns			0
so , taken to the extreme , if you were a @entity154 at @entity145 , you were given a good score			0
if you had never flown on us before you were given a not very good score , " he said			0
the system referenced commercial data available through airline computer systems and credit card companies , @entity130 said , comparing information like street addresses with phone numbers with where the passenger purchased the ticket			2
the system took names out of the equation , @entity130 said , because a " professional " terrorist would probably travel under a different identity with genuine documents			0
each passenger 's score determined how much screening and which methods should be used			2
a proposal after 9/11 for an expanded @entity147 system was abandoned in 2004 amid criticism from privacy and civil liberties groups			2
instead a system called @entity184 was introduced			0
the system compares information provided to airlines by passengers against watch lists , but does not use commercial data and protects travelers ' privacy , according to the @entity20			1
the watch - list matching program was fully implemented in november 2010			0
" @entity184 is not really a profiling program , " @entity24 said			2
" it is basically a program that is mostly focused on identifying wanted people or people that we already have their names in various databases			0
" @entity130 said he believes a more sophisticated automated system will be used within the next 10 years			2
bad things and bad people @entity20 behavioral detection officers are testing a " casual conversation " screening technique at @entity210 's @entity209			1
while officers talk with passengers they are looking for suspicious behavior and facial expressions			0
some passengers may be engaged in longer conversations , receive additional screening or be referred to law enforcement if suspicious behaviors persist , according to @entity20 spokesman @entity220			1
the incorporation of the " human factor " in @entity16 airport security is overdue , @entity24 said			1
" in other terms , instead of just looking for bad items , we need to look for bad people			0
" @entity130 is skeptical of behavioral analysis and would like to see more evidence of its effectiveness			0
@entity24 acknowledges that the efficacy of the @entity20 's program will depend on the quality of the program , the training and the personnel			1
@entity24 said his professional experience with @entity31 airport security , widely considered to be the best in the world and heavily reliant on behavioral analysis and profiling , does n't mean he would suggest the @entity16 go to the same lengths			1
but the @entity16 system should understand the roots of @entity31 's success , he said , and incorporate them in a way that fits within our legal framework			0
how the @entity20 will tailor and add to layered passenger screening remains to be seen			1
but , while there are no guarantees , these experts expect some of today 's little annoyances to be phased out for most passengers			2
" and i 'm glad , " @entity70 said			0
" because i like to wear wingtip shoes to go with my suit and having to unlace and take them off and put them back on is getting to be a real hassle			0
" @entity0 's @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report			0

experts name reinforced cockpit doors among best aviation security moves since 9/11
