-- if this all shakes out the way authorities say it will , the deaths of two local prosecutors , the panic that gripped a city and a massive manhunt that ensued may all stem from the theft of some computer monitors and a disgraced lawman who held a grudge the size of @entity14			1
the brazen shootings of a @entity17 prosecutor in january and those of the local district attorney and his wife last month stunned the nation			1
an army of law enforcement officials converged on the area near @entity25			2
gov. @entity26 vowed to find the killer and doubled a $ 100,000 reward that had already been offered			2
but despite the feverish search , investigators had one big problem - a plethora of suspects			2
by the nature of their jobs , prosecutors make many enemies			2
detectives eyed an ever - growing lineup of potential suspects -- a local white supremacist gang , drug cartels			1
leads that had them looking far away from the town where victims were gunned down			2
but in the end , prosecutors say , the culprit was closer than they thought			2
in broad daylight those who worked with @entity52 thought the prosecutor was lucky to still be alive			1
the hard - charging attorney , known for being a supreme story teller , had his own story to tell			1
he had once crashed a @entity58 - era plane -- an insane plummet that crushed his skull and left him without the sense of smell			2
he survived , only to meet his demise january 31 on the county courthouse parking lot			1
someone confronted @entity52 , investigators say , then shot him dead			2
the killing , which occurred in broad daylight in the middle of town , sent law enforcement scrambling			2
a local attorney said @entity52 feared for his life and had recently began carrying a gun with him to work , daily			1
detectives scoured @entity52 's cases for possible culprits			2
but still as the days moved on , no was arrested			1
no was named as the prime suspect			2
district attorney @entity80 vowed to find the " scum " who killed his " stellar " assistant			1
shot a dozen times @entity80 , a man known for not mincing words when it came to criminals , was angry			2
he aimed a steely stare at the reporter 's cameras as if eying @entity52 's killer			0
" i hope that the people that did this are watching , because we 're very confident that we 're going to find you , " @entity80 said at a january news conference			1
" we 're going to pull you out of whatever hole you 're in , we 're going to bring you back and let the people of @entity17 prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law			0
" two months later , the 63 - year - old prosecutor was dead			1
his body was found in his @entity17 home along with his wife 's on march 30			1
they both were riddled with bullets , investigators said , shot at least a dozen times			0
@entity110 , wife killed at his funeral , @entity80 's daughter told the many assembled to continue to fight like her father had			1
" he was quite eloquent in saying that he did n't give a sh - t if people were scaring him , and he was n't frightened , and he was going to stand his ground , " @entity116 said			0
but fear seemed to be creeping in			0
an interim district attorney was picked to lead the shaken area until the governor could select a new top prosecutor			1
" i wonder if the governor is going to find anyone brave enough to take the job of district attorney , " @entity17 city mayor @entity125 said at the time			1
disgraced justice before his death , @entity80 had wondered if a white supremacist group was behind the killing of @entity52			1
" we put some real dents in the @entity138 around here in the past year , " @entity80 told @entity135			0
@entity80 said @entity52 was n't involved in the @entity138 of @entity14 investigation , but his office was one of numerous @entity14 and federal agencies involved in an investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of the group -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges			1
and while detectives were investigating that angle and many others , others focused closer to home			0
the recent trial of a local elected official had made some feel uneasy			1
the 2012 trial of @entity159 , @entity17 's then - justice of the peace was big news in the area			1
" it was a mega-trial for a little community , the sense of it - it was a big trial , " said @entity163 of the @entity165 newspaper			0
@entity159 lost his job as a justice of the peace after surveillance video showed him taking county computer equipment			1
he was found guilty of felony theft , got two years probation and lost his law license			0
neighbors say his life was turned upside down			0
in a statement filed with the court after his conviction , @entity159 denied the thefts and called the loss of his law license " a life long sentence			0
" " i will have to seek another career , with a felony i will not be able to earn what i am used to , " he said , adding that it would be his wife , who he said was on disability , and his aging parents who would suffer the most			1
after the killings , investigators interviewed @entity159 , meeting him at a @entity196			0
they asked him to take a gun residue test which he did			0
@entity159 , through his lawyer , denied any involvement , said he was cooperating			0
he said he understood why he was being questioned			0
@entity159 , his attorney said , held no grudges			1
@entity203 known as tough court opponent a confession last week , officials arrested @entity159 and accused him of sending threatening emails to investigators after @entity80 's death			1
at the time , investigators did not say if @entity159 was being investigated for the string of killings			0
that arrest left many , who had been searching for answers for so long , with more questions			0
then @entity159 ' wife was arrested wednesday and an arrest warrant made public that seemed to provide the answers			1
according to the warrant , the wife described her role and said that her husband , @entity159 , fatally shot @entity52 and the @entity225			1
" during the interview the defendant gave details of both offenses which had not been made public , " the arrest affidavit said			0
focus on the @entity159 had intensified over the weekend after authorities carried out searches of their home as well as a storage unit			0
an @entity237 spokesman said investigators recovered a cache of guns and a police - style vehicle			0
witnesses reported seeing one like it in the @entity247 ' neighborhood around the time of their killings			0
murders of prosecutors in @entity252 called ' beyond rare ' what next @entity159 has yet to be charged for the killings			0
his wife , @entity254 , 46 , is being held on murder charges			1
for residents of the close - knit community , the arrest brought a glimmer of hope " quite honestly this has been troubling			0
it is a tragic series of events that none of us would have ever expected to occur in our county , " @entity17 judge @entity262 said			0
" there is a sense of relief that perhaps this case is moving forward			2
" for @entity163 , of the local @entity165 newspaper , the arrests may remind her of a warning @entity80 gave her			2
before his death , the district attorney told her that he suspected that @entity159 was dangerous			1
the scorned lawman 's grudge could extend beyond just getting even with the legal system @entity80 had warned			0
@entity80 had advised the reporter to be careful around @entity159			0
" because i sat in the front row and covered this trial for 10 days , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity284 contributed to this report .			0
