@entity0 -- the venomous attack on the pregnant @entity3 by author @entity4 calling her bland and " machine made " is a cheap publicity stunt			1
her remarks saying her impression of our future queen is that of a " jointed doll on which certain rags are hung , " with a " plastic smile " and " only purpose being to give birth , " is mean spirited in the extreme			2
where does the double man @entity20 winner get this impression ? has she ever seen @entity3 up close or seen her interact with people at home and abroad ? i doubt it very much			1
if she had she would not have been so rude and inaccurate			0
the darling of the literary establishment i fear is playing publicity seeking games ; raising her profile on the back of one of the most famous women on the planet right now			2
i respect @entity4 as a writer			1
i like her books too			0
but she clearly knows very little about modern princesses -- or duchesses even			0
perhaps all that time writing about @entity41 princesses has led her to lose her head -- like so many @entity41 heroines			2
@entity4 has never met the duchess			1
she has never seen her at work			0
i have , and i have been impressed by the speed and ease with which she has taken to the job of being a front line royal			2
people who meet @entity3 warm to her			1
she has a winning smile and easy charm			1
yes , she has a long way to go , and is not the new princess @entity55 as many in the media are hoping for			0
but i think she is slowly but surely carving out a role for herself			0
even @entity55 took years in the job before growing into the global icon who was so admired before she was taken from us so tragically			0
for somebody who is relatively new to royal engagements , @entity3 has performed with aplomb			1
on foreign assignments too , i have seen her at close quarters in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
she is professional and warm , complimenting her husband prince @entity71 as they carry out their royal duties together			1
@entity3 and @entity71 are a great double act			1
there is her wifely strength , like the @entity77 , and as a @entity78 she does not try to steal the limelight from her husband			0
the @entity81 and @entity3 have kept a dignified silence over @entity4 's rant			1
it 's a wise stance			0
i know the team around @entity3 and far from her being a " machine - made doll " or " designed by a committee " she has a hands - on role in everything she does			1
she has chosen to be patron of charities in which she has a deep personal interest			0
@entity3 , in the coming months and years , will let her actions speak for her			1
today she was back doing royal duties for her charity @entity98 at @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity0			0
she looked fabulous as she stepped out of the royal car , happy to show her baby bump to the media gathered outside			0
she was well briefed and knew her stuff			0
she is a beautiful , educated and stylish young woman , who has embraced her role with ease and injected much - needed glamour to the @entity109 royal family			2
the @entity81 will step up the number of patronages in the coming months and claims that @entity3 is a plastic princess will soon fade			2
@entity3 has her detractors -- many internet trolls label her work shy -- but i am surprised someone of @entity118 's stature has joined in this pastime , attacking @entity3 for no apparent reason			1
in my view she has abused her position among the novel - writing elite to launch this astonishing attack on a woman half way through her pregnancy			1
@entity4 , whose latest books are set in the @entity41 court , is lucky she is not a character in one of her own books			2
if she had attacked the wife of a future king back then with such vitriol she may have soon lost her head in a more literal sense .			0
