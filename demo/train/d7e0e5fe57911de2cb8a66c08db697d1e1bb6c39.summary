@entity1 's high administrative court on saturday upheld a controversial decision to dissolve parliament -- a move the nation 's president emphatically opposes -- state news reported			1
the @entity8 , which ruled @entity1 after the 2011 ouster of longtime president @entity10 , dissolved parliament in june 2012 in line with a ruling from the @entity14 that declared the constitutional articles that regulated parliamentary elections were invalid			1
that soon set up a showdown with @entity19 , who was elected president later that month and whose former group , the @entity21 and its @entity22 , had won more legislative seats than any other entity			0
@entity19 opted to override the military by calling back parliament when he took office june 30 , though weeks later he vowed to respect the court 's ruling that parliament was still dissolved			1
saturday 's decision , by the high administrative court , once again upholds the decision on the so - called @entity34 because the elections that spawned it , beginning in november 2011 , were unconstitutional , the state - run @entity38 news website reported			0
judges did n't entirely close the book on the case , though			0
judges set aside a ruling on a similar case involving parliament , promising to rule on october 15			1
even as things may change , the decision for now continues to leave @entity1 without a democratically elected legislative body at a time it faces a host of issues , including major economic problems and social unrest			0
however , there 's no longer a political crisis pitting against @entity19 against the @entity8 , which assumed legislative powers after it dissolved parliament			2
in august , @entity19 shook up @entity1 's powerful military leadership by replacing top generals and reasserting powers that the military claimed for itself before he took office			2
he also reversed the june constitutional decree by the @entity8 that claimed to retain legislative authority until a new parliament could be sworn in near the end of the year , @entity65 said .			0

@entity71 says @entity1 's parliament remains dissolved , as it ruled earlier
but the court will rule october 15 on a similar case , leaving the door open for change
