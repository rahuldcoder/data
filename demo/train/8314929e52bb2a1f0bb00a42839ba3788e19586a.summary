villagers in northwest @entity2 set court documents on fire in protest over a land dispute			2
such examples of forced evictions and land conflicts are cited by the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) in a report , " @entity21 , " released thursday			1
the report was a collection of voices from people rarely heard and " present a painful look into the lives of people affected by forced evictions and intimidation , mainly the rural poor , " said @entity20 , a network of 21 non-governmental organizations			1
" the voices in the report belong to @entity2 who have been or are facing eviction			1
most have insisted that their names and photographs be used , believing that openness will bring justice and appropriate solutions , " the group said , adding that such trust is " the springboard for the next stage of @entity2 's recovery from decades of civil strife			1
" an estimated 150,000 @entity2 live at risk of forced eviction , @entity48 said in its 2008 report on the country			1
read about @entity54 patients who were resettled to an isolated area @entity56 , deputy director general of @entity2 's @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , said the government was committed to finding the best solutions for not just squatters , but the entire population , and that it is drafting legal guidelines on squatter resolution			1
he also said the government rejected the term forced evictions , saying that meant people were forced off land they legally owned			1
he noted that various factors affect land use and ownership in the country : the 1970s ultra-maoist @entity77 regime abolished all legal and regulatory documents regarding land , strong economic growth has contributed to demand for land , particularly in urban areas , and the pace of urbanization has stepped up in recent years			0
" many people illegally occupy land that does not belong to them , " he said , later noting : " what has happened now with the resettlement , or the relocation , of people is the fact that the government is implementing the law			2
" " i am very sure that those who claim to be on the land before the legal land owner , most of them do not have any proof at all , " he said			0
" most of the cases that people -- illegal squatters , settlers -- have claimed that they have been on that land since , let 's say 1979 , are not true			2
if you study the legal development of @entity2 , you will understand , and not many people understand , including the @entity108 ( non-governmental organizations ) themselves			1
" @entity48 said poor @entity2 share the plight of many impoverished people around the world			1
the group cited the forced evictions of thousands in @entity114 , violence and insecurity in @entity118 's shantytowns , and social services denied to @entity120 in @entity121			1
" there are more than 200,000 such communities , home to 1 billion people around the world , " the group said			0
" in @entity2 for the last two years , @entity48 has been focusing on forced evictions as one of the country 's most serious human rights violations today , " @entity48 said in a statement on @entity20 's report			1
" the increasing number of land disputes , land confiscations , and industrial and urban redevelopment projects hurt almost exclusively people living in poverty			0
" people fighting evictions " experience harassment at the hands of the authorities or people hired by private businesses			2
the rich and powerful are increasingly abusing the criminal justice system to silence communities taking a stand against land concessions or other opaque business deals affecting the land they live on or cultivate , " @entity48 said			2
@entity20 said development of @entity2 , recovering from the @entity77 genocide and ensuing decades of conflict , " must not negatively affect " people 's lives			1
