-- a week after @entity2 's bungled @entity1 comes fresh news to tantalize , or torment , the company 's investors			1
the social - networking behemoth may be making a phone			0
@entity2 hopes to release its own smartphone by next year , according to a @entity11 report quoting anonymous sources at the company and others who have been briefed on @entity2 's plans			1
@entity2 has already hired more than half a dozen former @entity19 engineers who worked on the @entity20 , the report said			2
we 've heard this before			0
in 2010 , @entity23 reported that @entity2 was building software for a phone and partnering with a third party to make the hardware			2
citing their own sources , tech blog @entity28 said last year the phone was code - named " @entity31 " and would run on a version of @entity33 modified to integrate @entity2 's services			1
@entity2 's @entity20 : the most ill - fated idea since @entity36 ? but sunday 's @entity11 report added new specifics such as an interview with a former @entity20 engineer who said he recently met with @entity2 ceo @entity41 , who " peppered him with questions about the inner workings of smartphones , " including the types of chips used			1
" it did not sound like idle intellectual curiosity , the engineer said			0
" a @entity2 spokesman declined to comment on the report monday			2
the company had referred the @entity11 to a previous statement that said in part , " we 're working across the entire mobile industry ; with operators , hardware manufacturers , os providers , and application developers			0
" a @entity2 - built smartphone could allow users to more seamlessly send messages , post updates and share photos or article links			1
although it makes apps for iphones and @entity69 , @entity2 is still not integrated into @entity19 's mobile operating system , for example			0
the news arrives amid speculation that @entity2 , facing new pressure as a public company , will need to develop fresh sources of mobile revenue and exert greater control over its mobile products as users spend more time networking on phones or tablets instead of laptops or desktops			2
opinion : was @entity2 's botched ipo a conspiracy ? " @entity41 ( @entity41 ) is worried that if he does n't create a mobile phone in the near future that @entity2 will simply become an app on other mobile platforms , " a @entity2 employee told the @entity11			1
it also comes days after rival @entity92 closed its $ 12.9 billion acquisition of @entity95 , a deal that could let @entity92 make its own smartphone , too			0
many tech bloggers believe such a move would be a bad idea for @entity2 , in part because there 's no clear - cut consumer need for a @entity2 phone			1
@entity106 of @entity105 wrote that @entity2 would face stiff competition in the hardware business , an area where it has no experience and where profit margins are historically low			0
" so instead of building a phone , which seems like a desperate move , @entity2 should partner with every operating system and carrier and hardware maker it can to try to embed this social platform within every mobile platform , " @entity106 said			1
" and it should build great apps to float on top of these systems			0
" in a post titled " it 'll be a miracle if the @entity2 phone does n't suck , " @entity23 's @entity23 was more blunt			1
" making phone hardware is hard work , much harder than anything @entity2 has ever attempted in the past , " she wrote			0
" basically , there are a million ways this project will fail , and just one way it will work : @entity2 ostensibly could succeed by tapping into the opening in the mobile market where people want an alternative to poorly designed @entity33 phones â € ” targeting people who would buy something other than an iphone if the price point was $ 150 less and the design were at least a little bit more ambitious than what is currently available on @entity33			0
