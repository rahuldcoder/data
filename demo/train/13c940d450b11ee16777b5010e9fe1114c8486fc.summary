-- @entity1 may be creatively reviving " @entity5 " for its final season , but it looks like many fans are n't yet willing to give the comedy another shot			1
the veteran series â € ” @entity1 's highest - rated scripted show last season â € ” returned thursday night to not only its lowest premiere rating ever , but the show matched its lowest - rated episode ever			1
" @entity5 " had 4.3 million viewers and a 2.1 rating among adults 18 - 49 , down a whopping 46 percent in the demo from last fall			1
i figured the show would be down from its last premiere given how much its ratings dropped midseason			2
but this big of a drop is surprising considering how little competition was on the air and how much pre-season momentum @entity1 has had lately			0
thursday also marked the return of @entity1 's " @entity26 " ( 3.1 million , 1.3 ) , down 46 percent , and " @entity27 " ( 3.5 million , 1.7 ) , down 19 percent for its lowest - rated premiere yet			1
the network 's " @entity32 " ( 5.2 million , 1.6 ) was modest and " @entity30 with @entity31 " ( 4.1 million , 1.1 ) was down 21 percent			0
one of the biggest surprises in the fall schedule was that @entity1 did n't change this lineup considering how much it was struggling last season			2
@entity1 was in third place last night â € ” and @entity39 and @entity40 have n't even launched their fall lineups yet			2
the @entity42 has had a great few weeks launching freshman series like apocalyptic drama " revolution " and @entity47 's comedy " @entity48 , " as well as maintaining " @entity49 " ( see : can @entity1 's fall ratings winning streak continue ? ) , but last night suggests the network is going to have a rough time on thursdays this fall			1
over on @entity54 , more good news for " @entity55 " ( 9.9 million , 3.4 )			0
the reality competition jumped 10 percent from last thursday			0
the second week of " @entity57 " ( 7.4 million , 2.9 ) , however , took a slight dip , down 6 percent in the demo			0
