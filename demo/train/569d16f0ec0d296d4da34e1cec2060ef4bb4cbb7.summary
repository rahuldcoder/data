" i 'm ecstatic , you know , i just ca n't say how happy i am about it all , " his mother said			1
" i 'm very excited and pleased , and thank goodness this is all over			0
" but as they thanked government officials , journalists and supporters around the world for helping push for his freedom , the @entity4 family also told reporters at a press briefing in @entity13 on monday that there 's more to be done			1
" on a more somber note , we also -- and i know @entity11 sincerely wanted me to mention this point -- we want to acknowledge that @entity11 's two other colleagues are still there , " @entity32 said			1
" they also deserve to be freed			2
@entity11 wo n't rest until they 're released from prison , and we hope that will follow in the very near future			1
" @entity43 and @entity44 , fellow @entity12 journalists , remain behind bars			1
all three were convicted of supporting the banned @entity47 , but have maintained their innocence			0
@entity12 demanded their release , as did a chorus of many other international journalists			1
@entity2 's highest court recently accepted the appeal of the three journalists and granted them a retrial			2
on sunday morning , @entity4 's family started to hear rumors that something might happen , then checked with their contacts			2
it seemed like it could be true			0
" but @entity2 is a very uncertain and unpredictable place , and until he was on that plane , anything could have happened			0
... he was n't out of there until he was out of there , " @entity32 said			2
now @entity11 is in @entity71 , " gathering his thoughts , " his brother said			1
" he 's safe , healthy and very , very happy to be on his way home			1
" after his release , family members said he enjoyed a meal of beer and pork			0
now , his family members say they 're giving him time to figure out where he 'll go -- and what he 'll do -- next			0
" he needs that space to start with , " @entity4 said , " but we 're sure he 's going to be fine			2
" @entity13 foreign minister @entity86 said @entity4 had been released " unconditionally , " but will need some time to adjust to life outside prison			1
" he was somewhat bewildered			0
he was only given short notice by @entity2 authorities that he was to be released unconditionally			1
we moved as fast as we could to collect him from the prison and escort him to the airport and make arrangements for his immediate departure , " she said " he will make his way home , in his own time			2
i think he wants a little bit of rest and recreation , but he also wants to be reunited with his family and friends as soon as possible			2
" @entity4 left @entity2 around 4 p.m. local time ( 9 a.m. et ) sunday , @entity2 @entity107 spokesman @entity106 said			0
but one of @entity4 's lawyers suggested there could be more legal issues ahead for @entity113			1

" @entity11 must be tried in @entity13 and authorities there must determine if he is guilty or not			1
" @entity120 , the managing director of @entity121 , said he spoke with @entity4 earlier sunday			0
the journalist " sounded strong			2
" " he sounded immensely relieved -- perhaps not celebratory but immensely relieved , " @entity120 told @entity3 's " @entity123			2
" @entity120 sought to keep attention on @entity43 and @entity44			0
" it 's very unclear what 's happening to @entity44 and what 's happening for @entity44 , " he said			2
" but we just need to bring this injustice to an end and to get them out			0
" at the time of their arrest in december 2013 , @entity2 was mired in political turmoil surrounding the removal , by coup , of president @entity138 in his @entity47 - backed government			0
after @entity138 was ousted , the longstanding political party was declared a terrorist organization by the military , which had staged the coup			0
@entity4 described in a january 2014 letter how he and his colleagues were detained , saying that interior ministry officials burst into a hotel room that he and @entity43 were using			2
officials rushed @entity44 's home , he said			1
" i am nervous as i write this , " the letter read			0
" i am in my cold prison cell after my first official exercise session -- four glorious hours in the grass yard behind our block and i do n't want that right to be snatched away			2
" " that is why i have sought , until now , to fight my imprisonment quietly from within , to make the authorities understand that this is all a terrible mistake , that i 've been caught in the middle of a political struggle that is not my own , " he wrote			0
" but after two weeks in prison it is now clear that this is a dangerous decision			0
it validates an attack not just on me and my two colleagues but on freedom of speech across @entity2			2
" read the letter @entity11 wrote while in prison @entity173 and other observers have long held that @entity113 , @entity43 and @entity44 were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between @entity2 and @entity177 , the small @entity178 country that finances @entity12			1
@entity177 has long been perceived as a supporter of the @entity47			0
@entity2 is the sixth leading jailer of journalists in the world , according to a census the non-partisan @entity184 took in december 2014			0
the jailing and sentencing of the @entity12 journalists generated outrage from colleagues and activists around the world			1

on sunday , @entity184 called on @entity2 president @entity203 to " pardon and release @entity11 's @entity12 colleagues @entity207 and @entity44 , and the other journalists still behind bars for doing their work			1
" @entity211 did the same			0
@entity203 issued a law last november giving him the power to deport foreign defendants			2
it brought hope to two of the @entity12 defendants ' families , but stoked concerns for others			1
@entity43 , who used to work for @entity3 , has dual nationality , with @entity2 - @entity224 citizenship			0
some worried that the case would lose its international appeal if @entity11 and @entity43 were released , leaving the @entity2 defendant behind bars			1
@entity230 , @entity44 's wife , told @entity3 that she could n't believe @entity11 has been released			1
why him and not her @entity2 husband ? " because they were all three in the same case , i do n't know ( how ) only one got released			1
i do n't know why they released him ( @entity113 ) now after a year			1
what 's special about this timing ? " she demanded			2
" are the foreigners more important in our country ? we used to hear that the three would be pardoned , but does this mean that only foreigners will be released ? " @entity247 is worried but optimistic because she 's confident that @entity11 will tell the world that their imprisonment is unjust , she said			1
" no one will be silent			0
we wo n't be silent , " she said			1
" @entity11 wo n't be silent			1
" @entity247 said that releasing @entity113 proves that the case is n't about terrorism as the @entity2 government claimed , but about targeting journalists			1
" ( @entity44 ) was doing his job , " she said			0
" he was relaying news , saying what the @entity47 said and what the government said			0
do i need to explain what a journalist should do ? " @entity43 's mother , @entity264 , appealed to @entity203 in a statement that an @entity2 news outlet published sunday , telling the president that her son is ill with @entity269 and an injured shoulder			1
" as a mother and an @entity2 citizen i appeal to you , mr. president @entity203 , to pardon my son ... it hurts me to see his health deteriorating while i have little access to him , " she wrote			0
" my father and uncles have served in the highest ranks of the police force and the military			0
they have spent their lives defending @entity2 ... it breaks my heart that the son of a patriotic family like ours has been wrongfully framed as a terrorist in a trial that produced no evidence to ( support ) the accusations			0
" read her full letter @entity3 's @entity300 and @entity301 reported from @entity1 , and @entity302 and @entity303 reported and wrote this story in @entity305			0
