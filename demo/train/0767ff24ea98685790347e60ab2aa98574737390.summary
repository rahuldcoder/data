-- @entity3 wonder mare @entity1 extended her unbeaten streak to 25 races in some style on saturday , blowing away her rivals in the @entity9 at @entity11 's @entity10			1
her 25th victory was also her 15th at the sports highest level , overtaking the mark of 14 @entity17 wins set by the legendary @entity18 in the late 1970s and early 1980s			1
it was in 2011 that @entity1 posted what many consider her greatest - ever performance in this very race , beating @entity23 by three lengths after trailing him by the same distance coming into the home straight			0
on this occasion no such heroics were required			0
facing one of her toughest - ever fields , including her old foe @entity23 , admittedly not the force he once was , and the in - form @entity37 , @entity1 's regular rider @entity30 had to jockey for position in the early stages as he sought to overcome an unfavorable inside draw			1
the decisive move came around 300 meters out , when @entity30 guided her away from the softer ground by the rail and settled her behind the leaders towards the middle of the track			0
from there , all @entity30 had to do was pull the pin and the six - year - old instantly responded , lengthening away from the rest of the field with her to claim her eight consecutive @entity17 win			0
all day @entity11 had celebrated the presence of one of @entity3 's most popular sporting heroes			0
flags in her trademark salmon and black colors fluttered over @entity11 's iconic harbor , while the capacity crowd ensured @entity10 was filled the rafters			0
speaking after the race , @entity1 's trainer @entity65 praised the crowd , adding that he was " extremely proud " of his mare for breaking @entity18 's record			2
as @entity1 was cheered on her way back to the winners ' enclosure her jockey noted , " you can see what she means to racing			2
to be part of that -- words escape me			1
" with @entity1 's form seemingly better than ever despite her age , her connections have hinted that a return to @entity89 , scene of her narrowest - ever victory , may be on the cards later this summer before a rendezvous with @entity95 in the breeding shed in what would surely be considered the racing world 's own royal wedding .			1

@entity1 wins 25th straight race on saturday in @entity11 -- 15th straight at highest level
jockey on @entity1 : " you can see what she means to racing . to be part of that -- words escape me . "
