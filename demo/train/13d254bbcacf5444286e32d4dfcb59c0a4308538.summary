-- if @entity2 was n't the most wanted man in the world , he may be now			1
in the past week , a documentary detailing accusations of vile acts committed by the @entity9 warlord has spread like wildfire on social media ( at the time of writing it has had more than 50 million views ) , prompting international outrage and a groundswell of support for his capture			1
in the documentary , " @entity24 , " which was posted online by the @entity26 - based group @entity25 , the tales of atrocities are horrifying : armed supporters force abducted children to kill their own parents , brutal mutilations include the hacking off of lips and limbs , and the sexual slavery of young girls stolen from their families			1
the group says its aim is to raise awareness and bring @entity2 to justice			1
while some critics question whether the film captures the full scope of the conflict , one matter is without debate : @entity2 now ranks as one of the @entity46 's most wanted men , facing arrest on charges of crimes against humanity after a 26 - year campaign of brutality in his failed bid to overthrow the @entity9 government			1
how did @entity2 rise to power ? @entity2 , a former altar boy , was a young man in his early 20s when he was caught in the storm of violence that marked the final years of @entity59 's presidency			1
@entity59 was deposed in a military coup in 1985 , and soon after @entity62 's @entity61 ( @entity61 ) seized power			0
@entity2 's @entity63 was among those who rose up against @entity62 's @entity61			1
@entity2 was a spiritual leader , known as a healer among the @entity67 people			2
he inherited a powerful support base from @entity69 , a spirit - medium			0
@entity69 's followers would " daub themselves in shea butter crosses which they believed would protect them from bullets and they believed that stones would explode like grenades , " explains @entity71 , author of " @entity73 - @entity72 for @entity75 's @entity74 , " about @entity2			1
" it was a mystical rebellion , " @entity71 says , adding that @entity2 " was very much an inheritor of her mantle			2
" @entity69 fled to @entity87 after @entity62 's forces launched a brutal attack on her and her followers			0
staying in northern @entity9 , @entity2 rallied @entity69 's remaining supporters and recruited more with a powerful mix of mythical claims , charisma and unconscionable violence			1
what is @entity2 like ? @entity71 describes being one of the few journalists to ever meet @entity2 when the rebel leader briefly emerged from his jungle hideout in 2006			2
" although he was surrounded by phalanxes of child soldiers with @entity104 rifles and bayonets fixed to them , he actually looked terrified of meeting strangers , " @entity71 said			0
despite @entity2 's apparent fear and paranoia , @entity71 says the rebel leader was charismatic and clearly a " very powerful orator " when speaking to his people			1
" he had an almost musical voice as he spoke in his @entity67 language and you could see that the people listening were completely captivated			0
" what are @entity2 's tactics ? if @entity2 attracted supporters through his " mystical powers " and charisma , he kept them through fear			1
" certainly the violence is what made his movement so terrifying , " @entity71 says			0
" these attacks were carried out often with machetes or clubs and the violence was designed with a very clear political purpose			0
it was designed to illustrate to the people in northern @entity9 that the government of president @entity62 could not protect them			2
" @entity2 's forces are believed to have abducted thousands of children to join his cause -- however the exact number is unconfirmed			1
at the height of the violence during the mid- 2000s , parents tried to protect their children from harm by sending them to sleep in towns , away from @entity2 's ruthless kidnappers			2
brutal punishments were inflicted on those who were accused of disloyalty by an increasingly paranoid leader , @entity71 says			0
" @entity2 once gave an order that anyone caught riding a bicycle should have their legs cut off			2
bicycles were a very common means of transport in rural areas and he was worried that informers , if they saw the rebels , would rapidly pedal away and alert the nearest army post			0
" and similarly he would cut off people 's hands as a kind of warning not to raise any hands against the rebels , " @entity71 adds			0
how organized is the @entity63 ? @entity2 created the @entity63 with the intention to lead , based on his version of the @entity169			2
since then it has grown into a " disciplined fighting force , " says @entity71 , explaining that its members occupy a rank and are rewarded for loyalty			0
@entity2 has been able to maintain his hold over them with his mix of self - proclaimed spiritual powers and military strategy , @entity176 , @entity75 researcher with the @entity177 , said in a 2011 interview with @entity0			2
" he cultivates this image of himself as a medium for the power of the spirit and at other times , he presents himself as a ruthless military leader			0
so he 's able to maintain cohesion as a group and maintain the loyalty of his fighters , " @entity176 said			0
he noted that some former @entity63 fighters from northern @entity9 have given clues as to why some outside the group stayed loyal to @entity2			1
" they expressed the feeling that because they were given a rank , they were given a certain purpose , and respect and authority , " @entity176 says			0
" and then , once they 're outside the @entity63 , they find they 've become just another poor person , trying to survive			0
" where is @entity2 now ? " @entity2 fled back into @entity209 probably in late 2005 , 2006 and he has not been back into @entity9 since , as far as we know , " @entity71 said			1
he is believed to be accompanied by a small band of supporters , though his followers are still said to be terrorizing people elsewhere on the continent			0
" the mass abduction of @entity9 children and the terrible atrocities , the massacres that @entity2 committed have not occurred for some years now , " added @entity71			1
" however , his forces are still on the loose in places like @entity222 and @entity223 , and they still retain the capacity to kill large numbers of civilians			0
so although they 're not a threat to @entity9 now , they certainly are a threat to the region			0
" the @entity26 has listed the @entity63 as a terrorist group and in october , @entity232 authorized up to 100 @entity26 special operations trainers and military advisers to assist @entity237 forces searching for @entity2 and other leaders of the @entity63			1
the activities of the group are tracked on a website that uses information from the @entity25 's @entity243 , @entity245 agencies and local @entity246 to map and document recent crimes .			1
