greeted by throngs of @entity3 worshipers from across the region , pope @entity0 ended his two - country tour in @entity8 's @entity7 with a reference to what he described as a need for " authentic freedom			1
" changes between @entity14 and the world can come only if " each one is prepared to ask for the truth and if they decide to take the path of love , sowing reconciliation and brotherhood , " the pope said wednesday			2
he also met with the @entity25 country 's former leader , @entity23 , before heading to the airport for a @entity28 - bound flight wednesday evening			1
conflicting reports emerged wednesday over whether the pope had met with @entity31 president @entity30			0
two @entity33 sources told @entity34 the pontiff met tuesday with @entity30 , who is in @entity14 for cancer treatment			1
but @entity38 spokesman @entity37 said reports of the meeting were false			0
in a farewell speech just before boarding the plane , he criticized the @entity44 trade embargo on @entity14 , saying " restrictive economic measures , imposed from outside the country , unfairly burden its people			1
" @entity0 , whose office has routinely cast the trip in the context of a spiritual pilgrimage , at times addressed political issues -- often subtly , and on occasion more overtly			2
at the start of his visit , aboard a flight from @entity28 , he denounced violence caused by the drug war in @entity61 and blasted @entity14 's @entity63 political system by saying it " no longer corresponds to reality			1
" later , he prayed for " those deprived of freedom " while in @entity14 's southeastern city of @entity14			1
and he made several references to freedom in his final sermon in @entity8 , addressing a nation that human rights groups have routinely denounced for its abuses			2
many in @entity14 and around the world listened closely to the pope 's homily at the enormous open - air mass wednesday to see whether he would expand on -- or be more forceful in -- his apparent criticisms			1
but his comments often seemed couched in a broader discussion of religious openness			0
" it is with joy that in @entity14 there have been steps so that the church can carry out its mission , " but the country must continue to strengthen this path , he said			2
tens of thousands of faithful packed @entity7 to hear wednesday 's @entity93 the pope arrived in the so - called popemobile , his bulletproof vehicle , which slowly made its way to the altar			2
at some points , he appeared just a few feet from the crowd , which shifted as onlookers tried to get a closer look			0
rescue workers carried away at least three people who fainted in what was a comparably mild @entity107 heat , after waiting for hours for the pope to arrive			0
" every time the pontiff comes comes here , there 's always some sort of transformative period for us afterward , " said @entity108 , a @entity8 resident who joined the thousands that filled the square on wednesday			0
but @entity33 dissidents complained that police prohibited some activists from leaving their homes to attend the @entity93 and that others were detained			2
@entity123 said in a statement that activists were " facing a surge in harassment in a bid to silence them during the pope 's visit			1
" government opponents were detained , threatened or stopped from traveling freely leading up to pontiff 's arrival , according to the human rights group			1
" the clampdown has seen an increase in arrests , activists ' phones have been disconnected , and some have had their houses surrounded to prevent them ( from ) denouncing abuses during @entity146 @entity0 's tour , " the group said			1
@entity34 could not independently confirm those reports			0
the pope 's visit comes 14 years after @entity149 addressed massive crowds near the towering sculpture of @entity152 in the historic first papal visit to the island nation			1
@entity155 , a @entity8 resident who said she watched from the square when @entity157 spoke in 1998 , said there was a noticeable difference between the two pontiffs			0
@entity14 itself was also different , she said			2
" when we saw @entity157 , @entity33 did n't really know anything about religion , " @entity155 said			0
" now we 're open more			0
we practice ( religion ) more			0
" when @entity157 came " it was a different period in our history , " said @entity166 , a 50 - year - old @entity8 resident , but the former pontiff 's visit still " had more power " than @entity0 's			1
" during that time , there were many difficulties here , " @entity166 added			0
" now , there are some changes , and things are a little better			0
" after the island 's so - called " special period , " which began in the early 1990s after the dissolution of the @entity181 , @entity14 -- which had long enjoyed @entity181 subsidies -- was confronted with a prolonged period of economic hardship			2
when @entity157 visited years later , the country was still reeling from its effects			0
@entity14 is @entity0 's second stop on a tour that has also taken him to @entity61 , where he denounced the violence - plagued drug war before traveling to the island nation			1
" in @entity14 , there will not be political reform , " said @entity192 , vice president of the island 's council of ministers , responding to the pope 's remarks about its @entity63 political system			1
but some @entity8 residents at wednesday 's @entity93 said they were optimistic			0
" for me , there 's a hope " that comes with @entity0 's visit , @entity166 said			1
" there 's a hope that something 's going to change			0
