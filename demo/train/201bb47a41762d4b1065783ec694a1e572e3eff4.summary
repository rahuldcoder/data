-- secretary of defense @entity1 has announced new initiatives to curtail what he calls " the epidemic " of rape and sexual assaults in our armed forces			2
in 2010 , an estimated 19,000 service members were raped or sexually assaulted by other service members			1
clearly , more resources devoted to counseling for victims and training for prosecutors and judges will help			2
but the incidence of unpunished rapes will continue and so will the damaging effects these illegal acts have on troop morale and preparedness			0
this epidemic requires an overhaul of the military justice system			2
the military 's chain of command structure keeps most cases of rape and sexual assault from reaching the prosecution level			1
according to a @entity33 study , only 8 % of sexual assailants are referred to military court , compared with 40 % of similar offenders prosecuted in the civilian court system			1
the case of @entity39 spc. @entity38 of @entity40 is a sad testimony to a justice system gone wrong			0
according to @entity38 , in 2002 , while serving in @entity44 , she was sexually assaulted by an intoxicated soldier she knew			1
she reported the assault to her commander , who gave the assailant a slap on the wrist punishment of five days of base restriction			1
three years later in @entity52 , preparing for deployment to @entity54 with a military police unit , she was again assaulted by a fellow soldier			1
fearing nothing would happen if she reported the attack , @entity38 instead kept the incident to herself			2
a month later in @entity54 , she said she was raped by two soldiers who threatened to beat her if she struggled			0
although she suffered serious bodily injuries from the rape , she chose not to report it ; instead she slept on a cot with her rifle pointed toward the door for the first few days after the attack			0
soon , the chaplain was told about the attack by a woman in @entity71 's unit who reported that the perpetrators were showing a video of the rape to others			1
but her chaplain did n't believe her , later telling @entity38 , " you do n't act like a rape victim			0
" the commander said it was a " they said , she said " situation , and because she was married at the time of the incident , he threatened to charge her with adultery			0
the men who raped @entity87 were never charged , investigated or penalized			0
in the current military chain of command structure , @entity38 's commander and staff sergeant did nothing wrong			0
commanders can decide whether to investigate and issue virtually any punishment or , in this case , no punishment at all -- they have complete authority and discretion over how a degrading and violent assault is handled			1
@entity101 cpl. @entity100 suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder , but not because of her service in @entity104 , @entity54			0
according to @entity100 , she was raped at a @entity106 base by a fellow @entity101 who outranked her			0
when she reported the assault to her commander , she was ordered to keep quiet and to continue following her assailant 's orders			0
the rapist was promoted , but she lost her security clearance and subsequently left the @entity101			0
@entity100 and @entity38 are two of 28 plaintiffs in a lawsuit against former secretaries of state @entity115 and @entity117 that accuses the military of failing to prevent or prosecute instances of rape and sexual assault			1
in the @entity125 military , a woman is more likely to be raped by a co-worker than killed by the enemy			2
the epidemic infects every branch of the armed services , includes female and male victims , and extends to the military academies , which reported that 520 cadets and midshipmen experienced unwanted sexual contact during the 2009 - 2010 academic year			1
male service members are not immune to rape or sexual assault			1
in a 2010 survey of 14,000 active - duty service men , 126 anonymously reported unwanted sexual contact by a male or female co-worker in the past 12 months			1
a more disturbing statistic speaks to the distrust that servicemen and women have in the military 's ability to investigate and fairly prosecute alleged rapists and perpetrators of sexual assault			2
only 13.5 % of victims actually report the crimes			1
victims deserve an impartial investigation and the opportunity to have perpetrators tried in a military court of law			1
my bill , the @entity160 ( @entity161 3435 ) , takes complete authority and discretion out of the hands of commanders and gives that authority to objective experts			2
the bipartisan @entity160 creates a new office of oversight and response to handle all possible cases of rape and sexual assault in the military , enabling unbiased personnel to determine the appropriate path of action for each report			1
the office would be housed in the @entity33 and staffed by civilian and military experts trained to manage investigations of sexual assault			0
my proposal is not unique to modern defense forces			0
several of our closest allies have instituted meaningful reforms to manage cases of rape and sexual assault in their military			1
the @entity191 has largely transferred authority in military sexual assault cases to independent , impartial civilian personnel			1
@entity195 and @entity196 allow aggrieved service men and women to lodge complaints and access external agencies			0
all three countries strive to keep their internal military adjudication process independent from the influence of the military chain of command			0
we need to do the same			0
join the conversation on @entity209			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			2

@entity212 : most cases of reported rape go untried ; only 13.5 % even reported
@entity212 : in 2010 , 19,000 service members raped or sexually assaulted by other members
commanders have sole authority whether to investigate or issue punishment , she writes
@entity212 : victims deserve an impartial investigation and cases tried in a military court
