@entity23 , @entity24 : today 's show is dedicated to ms. @entity27 's world geography classes at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 ! welcome everyone ! first up : financial markets @entity33 : an overhaul of the rules for the country 's banks			1
president @entity38 says that 's what 's needed to avoid another economic crisis			1
he made the statement during a speech on @entity44 yesterday			2
but some lawmakers and economic experts disagree with some of the president 's proposals , like a federal agency that mr. @entity38 says would be responsible for protecting consumers			1
@entity51 , who heads up the country 's central bank , says that 's what his organization does , so a new agency is n't necessary			1
the timing of the speech came on the one - year anniversary of the biggest bankruptcy filing in @entity63 history ! president @entity38 says @entity63 's financial industry needs to learn from past mistakes to avoid future crises			1
@entity63 president @entity38 : one year ago , we saw in stark relief how markets can spin out of control , how a lack of common - sense rules can lead to excess and abuse , how close we can come to the brink			2
one year later , it is incumbent upon us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again , reflecting painful but important lessons that we 've learned and that will help us move from a period of reckless irresponsibility , a period of crisis , to one of responsibility and prosperity			2
@entity90 @entity33 : from regulation to inoculation , health officials say a vaccine for the @entity90 virus , also known as swine flu , could be ready in a few weeks			2
that 's earlier than expected			1
more good news : researchers say one shot should be enough ; originally , they thought it would take two			2
experts say certain groups , including students , should get the vaccine			2
it takes a little more than a week for it to take effect			2
@entity109 @entity110 , @entity24 : time for the shoutout ! which of these bodies of water is located in northern @entity5 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it the : a ) sea of @entity120 , b ) @entity122 , @entity123 ) @entity124 or the @entity125 ) @entity126 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! you 'll find the @entity127 in the northeast part of the @entity130 nation			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity2 @entity33 : and that 's where archaeologists have made a religously significant discovery			1
today , the @entity120 region is known as a tourist spot with a lot of resorts			2
but a couple thousand years ago , it played a big role in two world religions			2
and now , scientists have uncovered a piece of that history			2
here 's @entity148 ... ( @entity149 ) @entity150 , @entity151 correspondent : on the shores of the @entity127 , a discovery that should excite both @entity154 and @entity155			1
@entity5 archeologists say they 've found one of the world 's oldest synagogues , from the time of @entity161 and in the neighborhood of @entity161			1
@entity164 - @entity163 , excavation director : it is possible to think that @entity161 was sitting here with his community in this synagogue , praying together with @entity169			2
@entity170 : the @entity172 documents @entity161 ' time at the @entity127 , and @entity169 is believed to have lived close by this site			2
the ruins date back some 2,000 years , and may not have been unearthed at all if it were n't for construction starting on the foundations of a hotel planned for this spot			2
for these archaeologists , the date is crucial , as they believe this synagogue was operational at the time of the @entity185 , the main synagogue in @entity186 , and has a preserved , seven - branched menorah			2
@entity188 - @entity163 : we can see very nicely the curve of the menorah , which would presume exactly in the right temple , at the temple at this time			0
@entity170 : excavation is continuing , and already plans are underway to open the synagogue to the public			1
@entity197 , @entity198 : this is certainly the most elaborate one , with a mosaic floor with frescoes			0
we have walls here that are painted with frescoes			0
this is really the first time that an elaborate , beautifully decorated synagogue from that time has been discovered			0
@entity170 : building plans for the hotel have obviously had to change , but this discovery could well attract far more visitors than a hotel ever could			1
@entity148 , @entity0 , @entity186			0
( @entity213 ) word to the @entity215 @entity216 : a word to the @entity215 ... matriculation ( noun ) enrollment , especially in a college or university source : @entity224 detour to college @entity33 : this year , matriculation has come at a higher price , literally			1
the average cost of tuition at a four - year public college is up more than six percent			1
public versus private , in - state versus out - of - state : different schools come with different price tags			1
and for many families , college choices can mean tough choices			1
@entity239 has one student 's story			1
( @entity149 ) @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 : move - in day for college freshman @entity245 to a place she never expected would bring so much happiness and harmony			1
@entity250 , @entity251 : i 've been working all day getting my room together			0
but i like it , i 'm excited @entity255 : also excited : her parents @entity256 and @entity259 @entity260 , father : this is like a ride to a suburb when you live in @entity265 , so she 's close			1
@entity255 : but the hour - long ride to the @entity268 in @entity269 did n't come without detours			0
like thousands of @entity63 households on tighter budgets , savings and @entity275 taking double digit losses , family plans are forced to be flexible			0
@entity278 @entity277 : i was really , really completely set on going out of state			0
@entity255 : oh , we remember			0
we first met the @entity282 last spring			0
college acceptance letters were coming in , along with the prospect of a full scholarship available to @entity268 students with a 3.0 gpa or higher planning to attend an in - state school			1
but at the time , @entity245 and her parents were not seeing eye to eye			1
@entity255 : so , your heart tells you one thing , but the purse strings tell you another			0
@entity278 @entity277 : yeah , definitely			0
@entity255 : so , what are these conversations like with mom and dad when you all try to come to grips about a happy medium ? @entity278 @entity277 : they can get heated			0
@entity255 : that was last march			0
now ? @entity278 @entity277 : i ended up getting into @entity306 off the wait - list , and my decision immediately changed to back in - state , because i was going to @entity310 , but i switched back to @entity306 to save an indescribable amount of money			0
@entity255 : a huge relief for her parents			0
even though they spent years saving for her higher education , the thought of unloading at least $ 25,000 a year for four years of out - of - state undergrad was stressful beyond words			0
@entity322 chakales : well , it would have been very tough			0
the financial part was absolutely frightening			1
@entity255 : staying in - state , able to benefit from that @entity268 full academic scholarship cut their expenses by more than half			0
out of pocket now : $ 10,000 a year for @entity245 's housing , books and other fees			1
the benefits of their family decision : endless			0
@entity338 , mother : i think she 'll be able to study abroad for a semester if she wants to , and that probably would not have happened if she had gone out of state			0
@entity255 : the @entity343 are confident @entity245 will maintain a 3.0 or better to keep the state scholarship until graduation			0
but the family savings plan continues			0
in three years , it 'll be @entity245 's younger brother 's turn			1
@entity338 : we will probably start prepping our son a little bit earlier			0
@entity255 : in hopes that he , too , qualifies for the same kind of in - state help			0
@entity242 , @entity0 , @entity265			0
( @entity213 ) public @entity357 @entity358 : i 'm really happy for your , i 'm gon na let you finish , but @entity361 had one of the best videos of all time ! @entity33 : the most talked - about moment from the @entity366 was not part of the script : @entity358 interrupting @entity370 's acceptance speech to announce who he thought should have won			1
the backlash against @entity358 has been fast , and heated			0
this is n't the only recent outburst from people in the public eye			1
you might have heard about tennis star @entity378 being docked a point for her outburst during the @entity381 , and @entity63 representative @entity382 yelling out during president @entity38 's recent address to @entity384 on health care reform			1
promo @entity33 : all three have apologized ; @entity358 did it on his blog			0
but what we 're asking on ours is , are these outbursts appropriate ? are they disrespectful ? when and how is it okay to express your disagreement with something ? tell us your opinion at @entity400			1
before we go @entity33 : finally , mark your calendars : @entity0 is celebrating its 20th anniversary on september 25th			0
as a sneak preview for you , here 's a look back at the past two decades			1
( video montage ) goodbye @entity33 : looks great ! we 'll have more throughout the month			0
we 'll be back tomorrow with more @entity0			0
