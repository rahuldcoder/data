-- the passing of @entity3 president @entity2 from cancer , long expected despite his condition being shrouded in secrecy , has opened a @entity7 of questions concerning @entity3 's future			1
the @entity3 constitution holds that power should have been given to the leader of the @entity13 , @entity12 , once @entity2 could not attend his own inauguration and new elections should have been held within 30 days			1
now , @entity17 , current vice president and @entity2 's hand - picked successor , will likely face divisions both from within the @entity20 of @entity3 and the @entity3 military to keep his hold on power			1
but he also is likely to receive a challenge for the presidency from @entity25 , current governor of @entity26 and former presidential nominee , when and if an election is held			0
conflict among the @entity20 , the military and the opposition will largely determine whether @entity3 has a smooth and peaceful transition or one that descends into violence as various factions lobby for power			1
since winning his first election in december 1998 , @entity2 dramatically reoriented @entity3 's government and economy			1
his efforts have particularly focused on poverty reduction , providing housing and health services for the poor			0
although @entity3 poverty data are heavily disputed , most figures show poverty has indeed fallen			2
@entity47 statistics show a decline from 50 percent of the population in 1999 to 32 percent in 2011			0
inequality has declined as well ; @entity3 has the most equal income distribution in @entity52			0
news : @entity2 leaves a revolutionary legacy the @entity3 economy has not fared as well , with economic growth from 1999 - 2010 averaging a mere 2.7 % , according to @entity58 figures			1
this stands out , given the strong economic performance of other @entity52 economies during this time and high global oil prices since the mid- 2000s ; oil exports comprise roughly 95 percent of export earnings for @entity3			2
despite this windfall , the @entity2 government has done little to diversify the country away from its oil - dependence			2
at the same time , by using oil proceeds to fund social initiatives at home , support for @entity76 and other regional initiatives , such as @entity78 , which provides oil to mostly @entity81 countries on generous repayment terms , oil production has declined nearly 25 percent since 2001			0
the state - owned @entity84 , @entity83 lacks capital to maintain existing production or exploit new reserves , notably the oil - rich @entity88			0
this , and the horrible mismanagement of the company , have destroyed what was once @entity3 's industrial shining star			2
and now , with @entity2 's death , a power vacuum has opened in @entity3			1
under the political coalition of @entity99 ( the @entity99 ) and @entity25 , the @entity3 opposition is the most united it has been under @entity2			1
but @entity25 ' 11 - point defeat in october 's presidential election , coupled with @entity2 's allies winning 20 of 23 gubernatorial elections in december , underscores the fact that the opposition still holds little power			1
vice president @entity17 may not have the current president 's appeal with @entity3 , but he will still head a party with considerable influence			2
at the same time , the reaction of the @entity3 military will be key to the transition			1
the military can be organized into three camps : one is the institutional group , focused on the effectiveness of the military and largely non-politicized , and then there is the constitutional camp			0
with @entity2 's death , @entity12 , current president of the @entity122 , would preside over the country while new elections are called in 30 days			1
speculation is rampant that @entity12 , a former @entity3 soldier who participated in the 1992 coup with @entity2 , has stronger support within the military and they may push him as the next candidate			1
finally , there is the @entity133 camp that has committed itself to the revolution and will likely follow the late president 's wishes and push for @entity17			0
@entity137 : tyrant or hero ? @entity2 allies have reason to be worried			0
under @entity78 , members received generous terms for oil purchases , with payments as low as 5 % of market value , and the remainder paid off through generous loan terms spread over 25 years			0
even better , payment could be made in manufactured goods , with a barter system replacing payments in numerous instances			0
@entity76 has been the prime beneficiary , receiving roughly 100,000 barrels of oil per day , which meets two - thirds of its daily requirement			0
if @entity3 's next leader were to end the program , or even reduce the generous terms , many countries would see a shock as import bills rise ( not to mention having to face a public forced to pay much higher energy prices )			2
absent @entity2 's leadership , the @entity167 of the @entity168 might also find itself increasingly marginalized			1
extra-regional actors that have recently gained a foothold in @entity52 could find themselves losing influence			0
@entity174 in particular will have lost its biggest supporter in the region and may find future efforts to engage stymied without @entity2 's popular support			1
the @entity180 government , which has benefited from @entity3 's recent arms purchases , will likely find itself with a reduced footprint in @entity52 as well			2
furthermore , other @entity2 - supported regimes throughout the world , from @entity185 in @entity186 to the @entity188 government , will likely feel the effects of his death			1
for the @entity192 , oil supplies could be an important concern			0
while @entity3 imports have decreased in importance in recent years , falling to 8 % of imports in 2011 , it remains the fourth - biggest supplier to the @entity192 market			2
if the transition were to turn violent and exports dropped , @entity192 consumers could face higher prices and @entity192 economic growth could take a hit			0
@entity2 's passing also opens questions on narco - trafficking in @entity3			1
transnational crime has flourished under @entity2 , with @entity3 serving as a major hub for shipment of illegal narcotics			2
not only has @entity3 cooperation with the @entity192 declined , the @entity192 has also added several high - level @entity3 officials to its @entity216 list , including former defense minister @entity217 , for their complicity with transnational crime organizations and support for the @entity221			2
a prolonged struggle for power would likely give these groups even greater space to operate within @entity3			0
at the same time , this could produce spillover effects in @entity228 , whose recent security gains , with the help of @entity192 assistance through @entity228 , may be tested if the @entity221 can move more freely between the two countries			0
if there is a transition and new elections are called for in the coming months , regional leaders will need to play a key role in calling for a peaceful and democratic transition			0
the @entity192 -- with @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity228 , and @entity242 -- should urge for free and fair elections			1
undoubtedly , @entity3 will remain divided no matter the next president , but fair and transparent elections will help ensure the next administration has the political capital to tackle needed reforms -- from a stagnant economy to rising crimes rates , rampant transnational crime and the rebuilding of the nation 's powerful state - owned oil company -- that will benefit all @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			0

@entity257 : with @entity2 's death , @entity3 faces *difficult* transition
he says @entity2 helped reduce poverty , but at cost to economy as he mismanaged oil *wealth*
he says now power vacuum pits opposition against @entity2 - picked *vp* ; military will be key
@entity257 : @entity2 - backed regimes will feel impact ; other nations must urge fair elections
