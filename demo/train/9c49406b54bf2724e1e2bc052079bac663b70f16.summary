-- the cowards who aimed to silence 14 - year - old @entity2 with a bullet have instead made the @entity6 schoolgirl a global icon			1
even as she remains in a hospital bed , her advocacy for the millions of girls worldwide who are denied an education sounds beyond the borders of @entity6			1
@entity2 has reminded us all that the real dream for these girls is simple : they want an education			1
but she is also a symbol of how far we are from making that dream a reality			0
seven years ago , i traveled to an area not far from @entity2 's home in @entity24			1
a massive earthquake had destroyed 80 % of the town of @entity27 , and i was on site with @entity29 , working to salvage some normalcy for thousands of traumatized and injured children			1
the work was gratifying beyond words , as we brought warm coats and blankets to children who had lost everything			0
but the real joy of the trip was watching hundreds of girls attend school for their very first time			1
@entity29 specializes at finding opportunity in crisis , and this was no exception : parents needed safe shelter for their children as they went about the business of rebuilding their homes and lives , so @entity29 - supported schools met a community need -- and fathers who had never allowed their daughters to be educated agreed to let them attend			2
most of @entity29 's " schools " were open air , under trees or outside of tents			2
eager students sat cross-legged on the cold dirt			0
some of the girls were hesitant ; others boldly pushed boys aside to ensure they were sitting as close to the teacher as possible			2
one 8 - year - old leapt up to the makeshift blackboard and with great dramatic flair , pretended to lead the class			0
oh , the shrieks of delight her cheekiness elicited from astonished classmates ! suddenly , girls were equal to boys ! over the last seven years , @entity29 - assisted districts in @entity6 have enrolled more than half a million girls as first - time students â € ” including 21,000 in earthquake - affected regions			1
in @entity6 , the government spends less than 2.5 % of its gdp on the education sector , and only half of the 19 million children of primary school age are in school			1
about 58 % of boys are enrolled in primary school compared to 48 % of girls			2
but those numbers do n't reflect the real depth of gender inequity			2
in areas like the @entity102 , where @entity2 lives , the percentage of girls in school is far lower -- and overall , well under half of @entity6 women are literate			1
the percentage of female literacy is as low as 7 % in some rural areas			0
conflict , poverty , school fees and child labor create barriers to education for all children , but girls often face additional obstacles related to their gender and role in society			1
some are expected to work in the home , supporting the family , others expected to marry and have children at a very young age			0
some live in communities where girls are not perceived as equal to boys , or deserving of the same rights			0
and even as the global gender gap for primary school enrollment has been narrowed , there 's been little progress for adolescent girls : an estimated 31 million are not in school in @entity138			1
as a consequence of this gender discrimination , an estimated two - thirds of the world 's illiterate adults are women			0
the failure to educate girls has far - reaching consequences : a girl who is educated is more likely to educate her own children , and her ability to protect her children because of her knowledge will improve her family 's prospects through the generations			0
educating girls is one of the most effective tools for improving economies and raising productivity in developing countries			0
according to some estimates , about half of the drop in under - 5 child mortality over the last 40 years can be attributed to increases in women 's education			2
in my dozen years with @entity29 , i 've met thousands of children in some of the world 's most challenging circumstances			2
when i ask them what they wish for , without hesitation they respond , " an education			0
" if we want to stand with @entity2 , we need to raise our voices , too			1
all the world 's children have equal value and potential			0
it 's up to us to be sure they are provided the opportunities they deserve .			0
