-- as election 2012 heats up , the question of how corporations will figure into the first presidential election @entity4 is a hot topic			1
this week , both @entity7 and @entity8 renounced their membership in the @entity10 , giving us a hint of what corporate accountability might look like this election year			1
the companies quit the trade group , which had been pushing restrictive voter id laws , after being targeted by prominent african - american progressive group @entity19			1
with the controversial 2010 @entity22 decision , the @entity20 declared the corporate expenditure ban unconstitutional , holding that independent expenditures could not be constitutionally limited in federal elections , and implicitly that corporations could give unlimited amounts to other groups to spend , as long as the expenditures were made independently from the supported candidate			1
the president criticized the move in his @entity33 address that year , and a poll shortly after the decision demonstrated that 80 % of @entity36 , from both sides of the aisle , opposed the ruling			2
subsequent polls show consistent concern about the amount of corporate money being spent in our political system			2
the soda giants ' announcements indicate that corporate fallout in 2012 may extend well beyond ad spending enabled by @entity22			2
social media has enabled consumers to register opinions with unprecedented speed and visibility and , in the ever - competitive marketplace , companies are responding in real time			2
@entity8 announced it would leave @entity10 a mere five hours after @entity19 went public with its complaint			1
@entity7 followed suit on thursday			0
at issue are two hot - button topics : voter suppression and the " stand your ground " law that has been invoked as defense in the february shooting death of @entity65			1
both are timely and relevant , both disproportionately affect the @entity36 - @entity70 community and both were hatched in closed - door sessions at @entity73			0
@entity10 is not a new group ; it predates the @entity22 decision by almost four decades			1
@entity10 brings together corporations , conservative think - tanks and @entity79 legislators to collaborate on model legislation generally introduced through state houses			1
the voter id laws at the center of the controversy have passed several state houses and face challenges from the @entity87 for racial bias			1
an estimated third of african - americans do not hold state registered identification , so would be prevented from voting under these laws			2
voting rights advocates claim these laws would effectively keep millions of @entity36 from the polls			2
yet studies show that voter fraud is exceedingly rare and where it does exist , it is not likely to be remedied by instituting @entity102 laws			1
this sharp protest against @entity10 laws comes on the heels of the institution being spotlighted for its role in the stand your ground legislation at the center of the @entity65 tragedy			1
stand your ground was unveiled by the @entity114 at a 2005 @entity10 gathering and since the initial meeting , 24 states have passed the law			1
news : @entity114 's role with @entity10 @entity36 generally co-exist peacefully with the corporations whose activities pervade our daily lives			1
there is a mutually recognized symbiotic relationship			0
but , at a time when @entity70 confidence in government is at an all - time low , voters have little tolerance for displays of affinity between elected officials and powerful corporate interests			2
early on in the @entity79 primary , presumed nominee @entity138 was skewered for a response to a question at the @entity142 , where he proclaimed , " corporations are people			1
" this is a sentiment almost 60 % of @entity36 disagree with , and it reinforces that @entity138 's history of wealth and corporate elitism put him out of touch with the common concerns of most @entity36 and casts doubt on where his loyalty would lie if elected			0
@entity8 and @entity7 are hardly the first to face the wrath of disgruntled citizens			1
in 2010 , @entity155 came under intense fire after @entity158 campaign disclosure laws revealed that it had given a contribution on behalf of @entity79 gubernatorial candidate @entity160			0
@entity160 was known as a social conservative who opposed civil rights for gay and lesbian people and opposed immigration reform			0
weeks of backlash followed , included demonstrations at more than 1,000 @entity155 stores nationwide , hundreds of thousands of petition signatures and an intense social media campaign			0
in the race to command the marketplace through brand loyalty , the corporations ' own marketing strategies can make them vulnerable to consumer backlash			0
@entity155 had positioned itself as the family friendly , all - american department store			0
it was a place people could feel good shopping after @entity183 became a target for its union busting			0
similarly , " have a @entity8 and a smile " does n't fit as a slogan for a company involved in robbing @entity36 of their democratic right to vote			1
@entity19 is a perfect emissary to @entity8			2
the company established a dedicated marketing group for @entity36 in 2006 and just this year promoted a campaign targeting black teens to celebrate @entity194			0
so , @entity19 represents a critical business demographic and its concerns must be taken seriously			0
@entity79 leaders have and will continue to cry foul about these kinds of efforts			0
however , as 2012 unfolds , we 'll see more of them			0
these campaigns have become the embodiment of democratic principles in a country where consumer choices matter and the government is seen as too close to corporate interests			0
this power of the pocketbook has the potential to invigorate the free market by investing more people in its outcome and to crowd - source our cultural norms by reflecting the values of a diverse country			0
this is something all @entity36 should embrace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

@entity226 : @entity8 *bowing* out of @entity10 shows how accountability looks in election year
she says @entity10 pushed voter @entity102 , " stand your ground " laws
she says in @entity4 world , people do n't tolerate *mix* of corporations , politics
@entity226 : look for more consumers to seek democracy amid corporate *influence*
