-- @entity1 moved a step closer to breaking @entity4 's stranglehold on the @entity6 title with a controversial 1 - 0 victory at home to @entity9 on tuesday night			1
@entity10 headed the only goal against his former club just before halftime to put the @entity15 side four points clear of three - time defending champions united with four matches to play			1
third - placed @entity19 can leapfrog @entity4 into second place with victory over @entity15 rivals @entity22 on wednesday and be three points adrift of @entity1			1
@entity9 , just five points above the relegation zone , were angry after not being awarded a penalty in each half for alleged handball by @entity29 and @entity30 -- but were lucky not to concede more goals as @entity1 dominated late in the match			1
" they were n't claims for a penalty , " @entity9 boss @entity33 told match broadcaster @entity35			1
" they were stonewall penalties			0
i knew it at the time			0
" @entity29 is a world - class player , but looking at this replay he could be a world - class volleyball player			2
" i 've asked the linesman about [ the @entity30 incident ] after the game but he 's said it hit his shoulder			0
he needs to take another look at that			0
" @entity1 boss @entity52 chose not to comment on the incidents			2
" it is not my job to judge the work of the officials , " the @entity54 said			0
" it is a difficult job , sometimes they make the right decisions , sometimes they make bad decisions			0
" we have to maintain this level			0
we are doing well , we are very focused and in a very good position , but we have a very difficult game on saturday against @entity22 and we have to do our best to win that game			2
" @entity1 were less impressive in the first half , and it took until the 43rd minute before @entity71 striker @entity10 broke the deadlock with a close - range header from @entity29 's left - wing cross for his first goal since january			1
@entity9 striker @entity76 had told reporters before the match that his former teammate @entity10 was unhappy playing with @entity29 , but the duo combined well to end @entity9 ' stubborn resistance			1
the recalled @entity82 should have made it 2 - 0 in the 54th minute but goalkeeper @entity84 blocked the @entity87 forward 's shot with his legs			1
@entity76 was booked for a crude tackle on @entity90 in the 77th minute , and @entity91 hit the post soon after with a fierce low shot after a clever dummy by @entity82 's replacement @entity96			0
@entity97 midfielder @entity96 gave @entity1 fresh impetus , with @entity99 heading his cross tamely at @entity84			2
@entity30 drove a shot just wide from a corner but soon after was beaten in the air at the other end by @entity9 substitute @entity105 -- however , the @entity107 's header went wide			2
@entity96 should have doubled the lead in injury - time , but somehow stumbled over @entity110 's low cross when it seemed easier to score			2
meanwhile , @entity112 moved into the final of the @entity114 with a 1 - 0 victory away to @entity116 on tuesday night , winning 2 - 0 on aggregate			1
@entity119 striker @entity118 scored the only goal in the 57th minute to keep @entity122 's team in the hunt for three trophies this season			0
the @entity127 semifinalists , who drew 2 - 2 with @entity116 at the weekend , will face either new @entity129 leaders @entity130 or @entity131 in the title match			1
also on tuesday , @entity133 sacked coach @entity134 after the sardinian team 's slump to 12th in the @entity54 top flight following a haul of just two points from nine matches			0
@entity134 was voted @entity129 coach of the year by his peers for guiding @entity133 to ninth place last season , but became the 16th to be dismissed this campaign .			0

@entity6 leaders @entity1 move four points clear of @entity4
