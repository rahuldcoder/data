-- does your television take up a high percentage of your living room ? have you ever bailed out on plans to cook dinner to watch an episode of " @entity8 " ? do you run into situations where your dvr gets overloaded because there are too many shows you want to record ? no , i am not here to chastise you for being a couch potato or to tell you that so much tv - watching is actively decreasing your brain cells			0
i am here to congratulate you for being a tv head ! for us tv heads , the third week in may rivals the week between @entity23 and @entity24 for everyone else			0
it 's " upfronts " week ! this week in @entity29 , the major networks are holding grand events -- think big presentations and musical numbers -- to unveil their fall and winter lineups			1
@entity36 and @entity37 upfronts are monday			0
and the @entity40 takes their turn on thursday			0
for advertisers , this is how they decide when and where they would like to run commercials			0
for the press , it 's time to get the lowdown on what 's coming down the boob - tube pipeline			2
and for tv heads , it 's a big old tease since most people wo n't be able to actually watch any new shows until september			2
but who cares ? it is like being able to see into the television future ! here are five recently revealed greenlit shows that we are especially looking forward to			0
the @entity0 : @entity61 , @entity62 lacrosse player , had a history of violence the show : " @entity66 " for : former " @entity69 " fans the @entity68 : @entity36 , thursdays , 10 p.m. ( est ) we were sad when " @entity69 " got canceled			1
luckily , our favorite part of the show -- the hilarious @entity73 -- is getting her own series			1
in " @entity66 , " she plays the virginal half of a best friend duo			1
and while the preview makes me think it retreads well - worn single gal territory , it 's written by @entity81 of " @entity82 , " so we are still expecting it to be genius			2
the show : " @entity86 " for : former " @entity88 " fans the @entity68 : @entity36 , wednesdays , 8 p.m. ( est ) @entity89 is the dude behind two of my favorite 10 shows ever -- " @entity88 " and " @entity8 " -- so i 'm pretty sure everything he touches turns to tv gold			1
his latest sounds like a spin on " @entity99 " -- it is about a couple who run a catering company but are really retired spies			1
when a friend goes missing , they snap back into action			0
the husband of this duo is the ultra hot @entity109 and the wife is @entity111 of " @entity112			0
" enough to make us say @entity114 and @entity115 , who ? the @entity0 : @entity117 and 9 stars who 've had nasty fights with @entity120 the show : " @entity122 " for : former " @entity124 " fans the @entity68 : @entity37 , tuesdays , 9:30 p.m. ( est ) oh , how we miss " @entity124			1
" luckily , its creator has this series in the works , starring two of our faves -- @entity132 of " @entity135 " fame and " ad " alum @entity134			1
the concept ? @entity134 is a nasty oil company big wig			1
his childhood sweetheart , @entity132 , is a tree - hugging activist			1
when they try to make it happen again , well , i dunno what happens			0
but that 's what the series is about			1
the @entity0 : 8 celebs who played nerds but landed hotties the show : " @entity151 " for : former " friends " or " @entity154 " fans the @entity68 : @entity36 , more info to come back in april , there was an epic three - way battle for the title " @entity151 " ( with @entity159 and @entity160 attached to two different film projects with the same name as this anticipated tv show )			0
well , here is television 's official entry to the race			2
it centers on a pair of best friends who , while playing the dating game , have taken to sleeping together			0
what makes us so excited about this show ? it 's written by @entity176 and @entity177 of " @entity178 " quirky love story film fame			2
oh , and we 're always looking for the next " friends " or " @entity154			0
" the show : " @entity182 " for : former " @entity185 " @entity184 fanatics the @entity68 : @entity186 , more info to come what if we told you that @entity190 -- who we 're still rooting for 15 years after " @entity185 " -- and @entity191 , aka the cute stoner from " @entity193 , " were teaming up for a comedy about two friends who join a mega law firm ? now , what if we told you that the pilot featured multiple shots of @entity190 's posterior ? yes , it 's an easy sell			2

" @entity69 's " @entity73 is getting her own series , " @entity66 "
@entity132 of " @entity135 " and " ad " alum @entity134 will star in " @entity122 "
@entity89 's " @entity86 " sounds like a spin on " @entity99 "
