-- it 's not often that a golfer shoots an 11 - under - par 60 but finishes his round with a tinge of disappointment			1
but that fate befell @entity7 , who saw his perfectly struck 25 - foot birdie putt curl around the cup but not drop on the par - four ninth at the tpc at @entity12 in @entity13			1
it was his final hole of the first round of the @entity18 and had it gone down , the @entity15 superstar would have joined the elite club of five players who have broken 60 on the @entity21			1
" to see that last putt lip out the way it did and not go in , it 's crushing because you do n't get that chance very often to shoot 59 , " he told the official @entity21 website			1
" he could not have hit a better putt , " said his long - time caddie @entity27			2
" disappointing for everyone to not see that one go in on the last , " said one of @entity7 's playing partner 's @entity31			2
@entity7 , who achieved the same 11 - under 60 score at the tournament in 2005 , joins fellow @entity36 winner @entity36 in being the only two @entity21 players to shot 60 or better more than once in their careers			1
" i was ecstatic ( in 2005 ) , and i 'm ecstatic to shoot 60 ( today ) , " @entity7 said			1
" but there 's a big difference between 60 and 59			2
not that big between 60 and 61 , there really is n't			0
but there 's a big barrier , a @entity45 barrier , between 59 and 60			2
" in another twist , fellow @entity15 @entity46 had shot a 59 in the pro-am wednesday , but it does not count for the record books , while @entity7 himself carded a 59 at the @entity51 in 2004 , a four - man invitational tournament which does not count towards the official money list			1
the five golfers to have carded official 59s on the @entity21 date back to @entity58 in 1977			0
@entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity63 @entity62 , the latest in the 2010 @entity64 , have also achieved the feat. the world record is a 12 - under 58 by young @entity68 golfer @entity67 at a tournament in his home country in 2010			0
@entity7 's heroics left him four shots clear of the field heading into friday 's second round -- a big improvement on his two previous lackluster displays in earlier events in the 2013 season			0
the four - time major winner has also attracted controversy off the course over remarks he made about tax rates in his home state of @entity85 , but on it he remains an flamboyant performer who regularly thrills the galleries			0
meanwhile , @entity89 of @entity90 has a slender one - shot lead at the halfway stage of the @entity93 on the @entity94			1
he followed his opening 62 -- one shy of compatriot @entity97 ' superb course record -- with a two - under 70 in tougher conditions on the second day on the @entity99 at the @entity100			0
@entity101 of @entity102 , @entity104 's @entity103 and @entity105 of @entity106 were tied for second on 133			0
@entity109 star @entity108 was on 135 , while world number eight @entity110 of @entity104 trailed by six shots after a one - under 71 in his first tournament of the year .			0

@entity7 shoots an 11 - under 60 to lead @entity18
@entity116 for a *magical* 59 *agonizingly* lips out on his final hole at @entity12
it is the second time @entity7 has shot 60 on the @entity21
@entity89 leads @entity93 at halfway
