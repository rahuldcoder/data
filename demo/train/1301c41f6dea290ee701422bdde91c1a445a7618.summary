@entity0 , @entity1 -- the world was watching in 2006 when the @entity5 - designed @entity4 opened in @entity0 and attempted to reform education			1
despite having four principals , curriculum overhauls , and student technology gaps , the school graduated its first senior class last week , with every graduate having plans for institutions of higher learning			1
" this is n't a school about technology , this is a school about redefining the norm for urban education , " said @entity16 , director of innovation for @entity18 , who is also the liaison to the school			1
" we 've had this saying from the very beginning : money and technology are great , but people are better			2
" and everything about the state - of - the - art facility , complete with digital whiteboards and streaming video in classrooms , was created to be different from the beginning , too			1
the majority - minority $ 63 million school was erected with school district funds in the tough @entity41 neighborhood in @entity0			1
the school partnered with @entity5 on new approaches to curriculum , teaching methods and staffing			1
the school is made up of students chosen by a lottery of public school students , with the majority of them coming from low - income households with limited access to technology and training			1
the school struggled in its infancy			1
its first standardized test scores last year were daunting			0
less than 8 percent of 11th - graders scored proficient or higher in math , while just over 23 percent scored proficient or higher in reading			2

" i do n't care how good the technology is , i do n't care how good the books are , the ancillary materials , if you can not create a stellar climate conducive to good teaching and learning , it 's not going to happen , " @entity64 said			2
" it 's about connections , it 's about relationships , it 's about caring			0
" test scores do n't tell the whole story of @entity4 , according to @entity16			1
" we wanted to take on all the challenges and still show that you could do it , " she said , adding that the school 's mission is to challenge the education status quo , all the while doing it under the same conditions as other public schools in the district			0
" and today , with 100 percent of these kids having college plans , i think we showed we can do it			1
" the original vision called for a paperless and textbook - free school			2
students were to be called learners			0
they would receive laptops for taking notes and tests and doing homework			0
students repeated the school mission " @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 " with ease			2
" things did fall apart here as far as the original vision , " said @entity113 , a senior and the school president , adding that students do use paper and textbooks now			1

" @entity113 , one of the 118 students who graduated on june 15 , said she plans to attend @entity123 to study journalism			1
college was n't always in the future for @entity127			0
there were times during high school that she wanted to give up			0
she credits the caring staff and individual attention at school with helping to keep her on track			0
