the beheading of @entity2 aid worker @entity1 by @entity3 is an act of cruelty , but it 's also an act of desperation by a terrorist organization that has found itself on the run			1
none of us , sadly , can be surprised anymore at the brutality of @entity3 , the insidious group that now controls huge chunks of territory in @entity14 and @entity15			1
but @entity1 's murder also reveals how little regard the so - called " @entity20 " has for @entity19 values			1
moderate and radical @entity19 clerics alike had called for @entity3 to spare the life of @entity1 -- also known as @entity24 -- a former @entity25 who toured @entity15 in 2007 and converted to @entity19 during his year in captivity			1
killing a convert to @entity19 is an extremely serious violation of the well - established consensus in the @entity19 community on the sacredness of life for converts to the religion			0
@entity35 , a mentor to many @entity38 leaders , had called for mercy -- not only because @entity1 was a convert to @entity19 , but because he had given up so much to move to @entity14 and help victims of the war			1
militant islamists in the country also went public with a request for mercy			0
they said @entity1 , a trained medic , had treated them when they were injured in battles against @entity14 government forces			2
it was inevitable that these calls would fall on deaf ears			0
beheading @entity54 hostages is one of the only tools @entity3 has at its disposal to retaliate against the @entity2 - led airstrikes that are beginning to land serious blows on the group			1
hundreds of fighters have been killed by airstrikes in @entity15 and @entity14 , particularly around the @entity14 town of @entity64 , and @entity15 troops have also made a series of advances			0
it took the @entity2 about two months to build up a critical mass of intelligence -- what @entity2 military officials call " patterns of life " -- about the behaviors and organization of @entity3 , but in the last few weeks that critical work has begun to bear fruit			1
on november 7 , @entity2 warplanes bombed a convoy of vehicles near @entity82 , in northern @entity15			2
the airstrikes were conducted against what was assessed to be a meeting of @entity3 leaders near the town			1
unconfirmed reports suggested that a number of top commanders -- including @entity3 chief @entity91 -- could have been injured in the attack			2
while it is difficult to keep track of the latest developments on the ground , what we do know is this : the momentum , at least in @entity15 , is shifting			0
the group 's leaders are being hunted down , and they 're feeling the pain			1
in july , a video emerged of a defiant @entity105 delivering a sermon at a mosque in @entity82			0
last week , @entity3 released an audio clip of a man purporting to be @entity105 -- a sign that , like @entity38 's leaders before them , @entity3 bosses are going deeper and deeper underground			1
@entity3 ' surge has been blunted by @entity2 airstrikes			1
the days when the group could sweep into a town and take it over seem long gone			0
the @entity15 army along with its allies -- the @entity122 and the @entity124 militias -- have made good progress in the past two months , retaking @entity126 and other strategic towns in @entity15			0
the nation 's military is being restructured and rebuilt , and the @entity15 state is beginning to stand on its own two feet			0
the terror group 's success up until now has been based on its ability to sell its narrative to poor local @entity136 communities			1
@entity3 has portrayed itself as the defender of persecuted @entity136 against sectarian @entity124 - led governments in @entity15 and @entity14 and elsewhere , and embedded itself into the communities of cities like @entity82 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
this narrative brought thousands of @entity136 together to fight the @entity124 under @entity3 ' banner , even though these tribes did n't subscribe to the group 's extremist ideology			1
but more and more @entity136 are beginning to realize that @entity3 is n't their friend			1
in fact @entity149 , have until now borne the brunt of @entity3 ' brutality			2
the group has killed thousands of @entity124 and @entity136 are also being targeted			2
in august , @entity3 fighters massacred 700 members of the @entity136 @entity157 tribe in eastern @entity14 , according to the @entity158			1
in early november , @entity3 murdered hundreds of members of the @entity161 tribe , a powerful @entity136 clan in @entity164 province , west of @entity165			1
today , more and more @entity136 tribes are beginning to organize themselves in opposition to @entity3 ' bloody reign			1
the battle for @entity64 could now prove to be the turning point			0
@entity3 has made a last stand of sorts in this small @entity174 town on @entity14 's border with @entity176			2
the group wanted to send a message to the world that not only could it defeat local opposition , it could defeat the @entity2			2
that mission has failed , and it was a monstrous strategic error			0
@entity3 poured thousands of skilled fighters into @entity64			2
we have evidence that many of them never returned , and that @entity3 has forced local policemen to join their ranks			0
but the heroic will of the @entity174 defense forces in @entity64 have broken the group 's will -- and most significantly , they have shattered @entity3 ' narrative of invincibility			1
@entity64 has shown that @entity3 can be defeated			0
@entity3 has been stopped in its tracks			0
the group is bleeding and the beheading of @entity1 shows @entity3 ' desperation to lash out , to show that it still has options			1
is the battle over ? of course not			0
it will be long , it will be costly , it will be risky , and it will last for years -- perhaps even a decade			0
this is an army of tens of thousands of skilled , fanatical soldiers who are willing to kill and be killed			0
@entity207 ( purported to be @entity105 's ) on last week 's recording declared : " they will never abandon fighting ... they will be triumphant even if only one man of them is left			0
" the top - down approach of airstrikes and ground forces wo n't rid the @entity217 of @entity3 ' insidious ideology			1
this is not about winning one or two battles -- it 's about dismantling @entity105 's killing machine from the ground up			0
the group can only be defeated when its sectarian narrative about the persecution of @entity136 is dismantled			2
we need a bottom - up approach that addresses the legitimate grievances of poor @entity136 communities in @entity15 and @entity14 , and gives them a stake in their political future			2
we need a political solution to the civil war in @entity14 that has provided @entity3 with motivation , funding , and thousands of skilled soldiers			0
and we need to put an end to the proxy war being waged in these countries by the @entity136 rulers of @entity243 and the @entity124 regime in @entity245			0
given the complexity of the situation , this is all easier said than done			0
the latest developments have shown that @entity3 is not invincible -- but to defeat the group , military cooperation without true political consensus on how to end the crisis will not be enough .			2
