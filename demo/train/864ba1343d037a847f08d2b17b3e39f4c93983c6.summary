-- there has been much controversy about the two - game suspension the @entity4 handed down in july to @entity6 running back @entity5			1
@entity5 was caught on a security camera in february pulling his @entity9 © e , @entity10 ( now his wife , @entity11 ) , unconscious from an elevator			1
he was charged with aggravated assault			0
that 's right , two games			0
i have something to say to @entity4 commissioner @entity18			1
@entity19 , we thought you really cared			0
we believed you when you said you wanted to create a more welcoming @entity4 game for women			1
and all of us were touched by the compassion you showed with your @entity26 campaign , even though those hot pink cleats disturbingly clashed with every @entity4 uniform			1
mr. commissioner , you even talked endlessly about making @entity4 stadiums around the nation more family - friendly			1
and despite all the disturbing medical reports of @entity4 players with life - threatening concussions , you have worked tirelessly to try to convince us moms that the game remains safe for our precious sons			1
( i forgave you for stretching the truth past all the medical evidence on that one			0
) and still , we thought : now that man really cares			0
we repaid your good deeds by watching the games in record numbers , helping the league boost its television ratings			1
we even started turning up at stadiums around the nation and buying all those form - fitting team - branded outfits now made for women			2
the @entity4 reported earnings of more than $ 9 billion last year , thanks in large part to women , who make up nearly 45 % of the league 's fan base			1
so , knowing you as we do , there was no doubt that you 'd send down the harshest penalty possible for @entity6 running back @entity5 after he was caught on camera dragging his then - fiancee , @entity64 , like a rag doll out of the elevator			1
surely , you , like all the rest of us , must have been appalled by @entity5 's actions			1
@entity19 will handle it , we thought			0
no way the commissioner who prides himself on being tough on players who step out of line will let this atrocious behavior go unpunished			1
what fools we have been			0
a two - game suspension ? you repay our loyalty with an insult ? and you expect us to accept that -- to keep on supporting your game ? not happening here			0
you 've shown us your true face			0
and sadly , you , mr. commissioner are a fake , a fraud , a liar			2
turns out you never really cared about women at all			2
where is the indignation and outrage you showed the world when handing down the indefinite suspension for @entity4 quarterback @entity91 in 2007 after he admitted his role in a dogfighting ring ? " your admitted conduct is not only illegal , but also cruel and reprehensible			1
... your team , fans and the @entity4 have all been hurt by your actions , " you wrote to @entity91 in a formal letter from the league			1
" your career , freedom and your public standing are now in the most serious jeopardy			0
i hope that you will be able to learn from this difficult experience and emerge from it better prepared to act responsibly and to make the kinds of choices that are expected of a conscientious and law - abiding citizen			2
" by your lights , it sounds like dogs are more important than women			2
or perhaps you subscribe to the philosophy of my misguided colleague , sports commentator @entity116 , who raised the issue of whether @entity5 's wife somehow brought an " element of provocation " into the situation			2
rightfully , @entity116 was suspended for a week by @entity122			0
but at least he has faced his critics			0
you , mr. @entity18 , were hiding out in your @entity4 ivory tower until you were forced to face the league 's female fans and try to defend the indefensible			1
it 's good to know where we stand with you now , @entity19			2
we should have known that you were just stringing us along			0
saying all the right words			0
sadly , we love this game so much it was easy to look the other way			0
but you 've gone too far			0
it 's time for us to fight back			0
i 'm declaring week three , sunday , september 21 , 1:00 p.m. an @entity4 blackout day in my house			1
that 's the game when @entity5 is scheduled to return to the field after serving his paltry suspension			2
and i 'm urging every woman i know to do the same			0
the blackout continues until we hear your apology			2
you do n't take 45 % of your customers for granted			1
because , in case you did n't know , @entity19 , without women watching the @entity4 , you lose			1
and we are keeping score .			0

@entity149 : @entity18 , @entity4 commissioner , talked good line on @entity4 welcoming female fans
she says women 45 % of league base ; might have expected harsh penalty for @entity5
but he got light slap . @entity91 , of dogfighting *notoriety* , had harsh punishment , she says
@entity165 : @entity18 shows what he thinks of women . she urges @entity4 blackout when @entity5 returns
