-- since its inception in 2009 , the race to @entity2 has provided @entity5 golf with a thrilling battle for big bucks that has gone to the final day of the season			0
such has been @entity10 's dominance in 2012 that the world no. 1 has sealed a notable money list double with two tournaments still to play			1
the 23 - year - old can defend his @entity16 title next week and then go to @entity2 for the $ 8 million @entity17 without the pressure of the last three years , when he was twice the @entity19 's no. 2			1
" it has been one of my main goals to become number one in @entity5 ever since securing my card five years ago , so to end the year as the number one on both the @entity5 and @entity28 is absolutely amazing , " @entity10 said after clinching the title with third place at the @entity22 on sunday			1
he emulated @entity30 's efforts from last year , but the @entity31 needed to play in extra @entity33 events to clinch the @entity35 crown on the final day of the season			1
' @entity37 ' struggling in @entity38 @entity10 became the youngest player to win the @entity5 money list since @entity42 's @entity41 did so at the age of 21 in 1979 and 22 the following year			1
" i set myself a number of ambitious goals at the start of the year , and to have ticked so many of the boxes feels great , " said @entity10 , who displaced @entity30 at the top of the rankings and won his second major title at the @entity47 after recovering from a mid-season slump			1
" i 've still got two events remaining this year , and the goal is still to try and win at least once more before the end of the season			0
beyond that , i 'm looking forward to a good break over the winter ! " @entity61 ( @entity60 ) won eight @entity62 in his prime , and i have only won one so far , so there is plenty of ground to make up			0
but to be able to go into 2013 as the number one on both tours is hugely satisfying			0
" @entity10 won $ 8 million in @entity70 events and has â ‚ ¬ 3,696,597 ( $ 4.7 million ) from @entity5 's almost worldwide swing -- though both circuits have several co-sanctioned tournaments			2
@entity10 's closest @entity5 rival , @entity76 teammate @entity75 , chose not to play in @entity38 and will not line up again until @entity2			2
@entity77 could have delayed @entity10 's crowning for another week , but the @entity79 lost in a playoff at @entity81 to @entity82			1
the 19 - year - old @entity83 eagled the third extra hole to deny 2010 @entity85 champion @entity77 his third title of 2012			0
@entity82 became the first teenager to win three @entity19 titles , having been the youngest to win one in 2010			2
@entity10 also eagled his last hole to surge up the leaderboard with a six - under - par 65 that left him three shots behind the top duo			0
@entity96 's @entity95 was another shot back in fourth on nine under overall , while @entity99 's @entity98 and @entity83 @entity100 tied for fifth			0
the tournament , which is seeking a new sponsor following the withdrawal of @entity105 , was plagued by bad weather but went the distance this year -- in 2011 it was reduced to 54 holes .			0

@entity10 *completes* @entity19 / @entity70 money list double on sunday
world no. 1 finishes third at the @entity22 to emulate @entity30 's 2011 feat
@entity77 could have delayed his title win but lost in a playoff to @entity82
@entity10 will defend his @entity119 title next week before the season finale in @entity2
