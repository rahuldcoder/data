-- a pair of robotic twins that have been diligently mapping the moon this year went out with a bang monday			1
as scheduled , the @entity5 probes @entity6 crashed into a mountain on the moon , ending a fruitful mission to study the surface and composition of the celestial body			1
" the two probes were sent purposely into the moon because they no longer had enough altitude or fuel to continue science operations , " @entity13 said			2
the agency named the site where the spacecraft crashed for @entity22 , the first @entity23 woman astronaut in space			1
@entity6 crashed on a mountain near the moon 's north pole at 2:28 p.m. pt and 2:29 p.m. pt at a speed of 3,760 mph , @entity13 said			1
they were about the size of a washer and dyer			0
" we will miss our lunar twins , but the scientists tell me it will take years to analyze all the great data they got , and that is why we came to the moon in the first place , " said grail project manager @entity33 of @entity13 's @entity34			2
" so long , @entity6 , and we thank you			2
" thanks to @entity5 , scientists now have the highest - resolution gravity field map of any celestial body , @entity13 has said			2
that means the probes have been making a high - quality map of the gravitational field of the moon , giving scientists unprecedented insight into what 's below the surface and how the moon may have formed			1
results from this mission have delivered several other important findings , principal investigator @entity58 of the @entity59 told reporters last week			0
these include : -- evidence that the crust of the moon is much thinner than scientists believed			2
-- some of the large impact basins dug into the moon 's mantle , which is useful because scientists want to understand the moon 's composition			1
it is believed that the composition of the @entity76 's mantle is similar to that of the moon			0
-- the moon 's crust is much more fractured than scientists thought			1
-- it appears the crusts of planets , including @entity84 , have been bombarded in a similar way			0
if there was water on @entity84 , as scientists believe there may have once been , where would it have gone ? @entity5 , looking at the moon , provides a clue : " these fractures provide a pathway deep inside the planet , and it 's very easy to envision now how a possible ocean at the surface could have found its way deep into the crust of a planet , " @entity58 said			1
another major finding : large , lava - filled cracks ( dykes ) , which are hundreds of miles long and exist about 6 miles below the surface			0
there 's no record of them at the surface of the moon			0
" these dykes actually provide evidence for early expansion of the moon shortly after it formed , " @entity58 said			0
" this had been predicted by models , but no evidence had been found			0
" @entity0 's @entity118 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 probes @entity6 crash into a mountain near the moon 's north pole
the site is named for the late @entity23 astronaut @entity22 , who died in july
the probes have been diligently mapping the moon and *collecting* evidence this year
