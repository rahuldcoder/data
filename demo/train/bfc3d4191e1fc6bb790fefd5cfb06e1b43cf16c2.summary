@entity0 -- while @entity4 is still publicly noncommittal about a possible presidential bid , his family is far less circumspect			1
and if recent comments by @entity8 are any indication , @entity4 's eldest son got the go - ahead from the family			1
the bigger question , of course , is whether @entity4 got the go - ahead -- from himself			2
while @entity8 told @entity16 that " i think it 's more than likely that he 's giving this a serious thought in moving forward , " it 's still unclear whether his father is actually willing to dive into a presidential bid			1
one source with knowledge of @entity4 's thinking tells @entity1 " wanting to do this and doing it are two different things			1
" in fact this source adds , " he has n't made a decision yet despite reports to the contrary			2
he is seriously considering and is going through a thoughtful process			0
he appreciates the warm wishes and support , but he is a methodical guy and wo n't change his timeline			0
" that timeline anticipates @entity4 making a decision by the end of the year			1
while some donors may be waiting to see what @entity4 does before they commit to a candidate , the source says @entity4 himself has not asked for them to stay on the sidelines			2
" they are calling him , but all he is saying is he has n't made a decision			2
there is no organized outreach sanctioned by him			0
" several donors told @entity1 that that in private sessions , @entity4 has not given any more indication than he has publicly about his intentions			1
one of the donors said " he is behaving as if he is looking at it seriously , " but his reluctance to talk about it is " wearing thin			0
" the choice about whether to run , a source close to @entity4 explains is " a serious decision which he understands better than most			1
" opinion : six @entity64 races to watch with a brother and a father who have served in the highest office , that 's a fact			0
but it 's clear both of them -- @entity4 41 and @entity72 -- would like to him to run			1
" if you asked @entity76 the same question -- ' should @entity4 run ? ' -- he 'd say yes , " @entity73 said in an interview with @entity1 earlier this year			1
" yeah , he would say yeah			0
" former president @entity72 told @entity79 earlier this month he had encouraged his brother to run			2
" he and i did have a conversation			0
i of course was pushing him to run for president			0
he of course was saying , ' i have n't made up my mind , ' " @entity4 said			1
" he 's seen his dad , he 's seen his brother			0
and so he 's a very thoughtful man and he 's -- he 's weighing his options			0
" one person who has not been enthusiastic about a possible @entity4 run has been his mother , @entity88 , who had told interviewers there were " enough @entity92 " who had been president			1
however , @entity4 told the @entity94 that she was now " neutral , trending in a different direction			1
" the notion of @entity4 running is something that has resurfaced after years of dormancy			2
" if you had asked me a few years back , i would 've said it was less likely , " @entity8 , who is running for @entity100 , told @entity16			1
" the family will be behind him 100 % if he decides to do it			0
" watch : are fear politics dominating the midterms ? one calculation that seems to have changed recently is @entity4 's closest family support			1
he told the @entity94 earlier this month that his wife , @entity108 , is " supportive " of a possible run for the presidency			2
before his statement , many in political circles assumed she would be reluctant -- even a stumbling block - to engage in a presidential campaign			0
@entity4 has been active on the campaign trail during the midterm elections , stumping for @entity119 candidates across the country -- and helping them raise money			0
he 's clearly collected chits -- but then again , so have all of the potential @entity119 2016 contenders .			0

@entity4 's son told @entity16 that " it 's more than likely " that @entity4 is giving 2016 run " serious thought "
@entity4 is expected to make a decision by the end of the year
@entity4 is n't giving any public indications of his thinking
