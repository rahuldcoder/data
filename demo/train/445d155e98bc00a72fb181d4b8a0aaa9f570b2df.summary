-- everyone goes through a rebellious phase			0
and , if you 're lucky , you 'll be able to look back on those years and laugh			0
if you 're less lucky , you spent those years on a reality show , so for the rest of time , millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead			0
in modern times , cats frolic among the ruins of ancient @entity11			1
but , hey , it could be worse			0
you could be responsible for the fall of @entity14 , just like @entity15 , the @entity16 princess whose wild ways and ( literally ) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the @entity16			1
barely regal smart , conniving , and ruthless , @entity15 possessed all the attributes befitting a roman emperor , except for that pesky y chromosome			1
as a young girl , she watched as her dimwitted six - year - old brother , @entity25 , was crowned emperor of the @entity27 , while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage			0
hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life , @entity15 rebelled with aplomb , sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens			2
although her after - hours habits caused quite the scandal , they failed to satiate her need for attention and power , so @entity15 set her eyes on the throne			1
employing her ample charms , she seduced her brother 's royal chamberlain , @entity44 , and together , they plotted to murder @entity25 and seize power			0
but , alas , their scheme was soon exposed			0
@entity44 was executed , and @entity15 was sent to a convent in @entity51			2
life as a nun was a fate worse than death for @entity15 , but even that could n't quell her ambition			1
she spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another			0
finally , out of sheer desperation , she turned to sources outside the empire			0
her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy @entity25 and risk open war with @entity11			2
only one man fit that description : @entity68 , king of the @entity69			0
@entity68 the hubby @entity15 got the barbarian 's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal : if @entity68 would rescue her , she would marry him , and he would get half of the @entity27 as her dowry			1
of course , @entity15 was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the @entity16			1
but she was betting that after marrying her , @entity68 would conquer the whole @entity16 , and she 'd become queen to boot			2
@entity68 had secretly been planning a move against @entity11 for years , and @entity15 's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike			1
wasting no time , he told @entity25 that he planned to marry @entity15 , and demanded the dowry he 'd been promised			1
naturally , @entity25 refused , and @entity68 used his status as a " wronged husband " to invade @entity16 territory in 451 c.e. the @entity88 armies quickly swept through the @entity27 , destroying everything in their path , and eventually they arrived in @entity11			1
like all the other cities before it , @entity11 would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the @entity69 during the invasion			2
@entity11 survived @entity68 's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe , the @entity100 , but the @entity27 never recovered			2
within a generation , the armies of the @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity69 had overrun the area			0
the princess bride ultimately , @entity15 became neither @entity16 empress nor a @entity88 queen			1
@entity68 never rescued her , and she was eventually sent back to @entity11 and left to her brother 's justice			2
not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed , and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again , @entity25 settled on a suitable third option			0
after years of struggle , @entity15 finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along : she was married off to an elderly @entity16 senator , and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history			1
