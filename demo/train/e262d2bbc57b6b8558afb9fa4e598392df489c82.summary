-- perhaps @entity1 was just overwhelmed			2
the " gravity " star had a busy thursday thanks to her @entity5 nod , and by the time she took the stage at that night 's @entity8 , she let an f - bomb slip during her acceptance speech for best actress in an action movie			1
@entity1 was trying to get out her " thank you 's " when a technical glitch interrupted			2
" what the f * * * ? " a surprised @entity1 said before joking that she 's an action star			0
the 49 - year - old was n't the only to go off - script that night : @entity19 sneaked in the expletive during the best comedy acceptance speech , calling his co-stars " these f * * * ing actors			0
" so the two played it a little loose , but on the other hand , they were probably still riding a high from that morning 's celebration			0
@entity19 , too , is nominated for an @entity5 this year in the best supporting actor category			0
2014 @entity5 : the nominees list in fact , some of the @entity33 ' choice picks mirrored @entity5 nominations for @entity5 earlier that day : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and " 12 years @entity40 's " @entity36 were all winners			1
could this be a reflection of what we 'll see on @entity5 night ? " 12 years " director @entity42 is probably hoping so			1
although it was @entity39 's " gravity " that won the most awards -- a total of seven , including best director , best score , best sci - fi / horror film and best visual effects -- it was " 12 years " that took home the big prize of the night , best picture			1
the film 's screenwriter , @entity57 , also won the @entity8 for best adapted screenplay			2
here 's the full list of winners			0
