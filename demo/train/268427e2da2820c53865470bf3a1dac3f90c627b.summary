-- the prospects for immigration reform just got a lot brighter			0
eight leading senators , four @entity4 and four @entity5 , came together to announce on monday their agreement on broad principles to modernize our immigration laws , which have been largely unchanged since 1965			0
since then , the world has changed dramatically and globalized markets have revolutionized our economy			0
but our antiquated immigration laws are still designed for an economy that existed when people were watching black and white tv			1
as @entity17 offers generous stipends , access to prestigious incubators , honorary titles and other benefits to lure home the scientists and engineers who come to @entity25 to study , we turn these innovators away			1
as @entity27 , the @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 offer visas and other incentives to attract entrepreneurs to their countries , we make it nearly impossible for most entrepreneurs to come here			1
and as countries like the @entity28 experiment with using independent economists to help determine which immigrants their economy needs , we continue with an immigration system that not only ignores our economic health , but actively works to undermine it			1
opinion : stars align at last for immigration plan in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , roughly 80 % of all permanent visas are used for employment needs			0
@entity54 , @entity55 , and the @entity28 allocate around 60 % of all permanent visas this way			0
but in the @entity25 , we give just 7 % of our permanent residency " green cards " to fill gaps in our economy			1
in the past , we could afford an immigration system that was not focused on recruiting top workers			1
with the @entity25 economy such a dominant force , these workers had no other choice but to wait and wait until they could get to @entity25			1
but in the global economy , talent is transient			2
a top scientist who can not gain access to the @entity25 can easily go work in a lab in @entity55 , @entity73 or any other of @entity25 's direct competitors			2
@entity27 immigration authorities recruit scientists with just this pitch , promising far easier entry and access to permanent residency then they could gain in the @entity25			1
if we attract and retain the world 's top talent , our economy will grow faster			0
a recent study by the conservative @entity87 and the bipartisan @entity88 found that , from 2000 to 2007 , each foreign - born worker with an advanced degree from a @entity25 university who stayed in the country to work in science , technology , engineering and math -- the @entity100 -- created , on average , 2.62 additional jobs for @entity25 workers			1
their innovations power new technologies , new products and new companies			0
and the reverse is equally true			0
if we fail to attract and retain the world 's top talent , our economy will falter			0
by 2018 , the @entity25 is projected to have a shortage of more than 230,000 advanced degree stem workers			1
jobs in these fields are exploding , growing three times faster than the rest of the economy over the last decade , but we simply can not fill them , even in a recession with so many people looking for work			1
the same is true in industries all over the economic spectrum			0
@entity122 immigration laws that discourage migrant farm workers have led to millions of dollars of crops rotting on the vine			2
overly bureaucratic and restrictive visa application processes have forced hotels to run at less than peak capacity even when demand is high because they ca n't get workers to staff them			1
opinion : key to immigration reform -- worker visas in an @entity136 and smartphone world , we need an @entity136 and smartphone immigration system			1
we need a system that recognizes that it is not only possible , but even probable , that a business would have its manufacturing in @entity17 , its headquarters in @entity142 , its back office in @entity73 and its sales offices all over the globe			0
we need a system that makes it easy for entrepreneurs , scientists , farm workers , engineers , hotel workers , business travelers and all the workers our economy needs to easily come here and help our companies compete			1
and we need a system that is flexible to changing economic demands , attracting workers when and where they are needed and easing immigration when demand for workers slows			2
@entity166 mayor @entity165 and the 500 business leaders and mayors who make up the @entity88 have been making the economic case for immigration reform for the last several years			2
republicans and @entity5 are once again , for the first time in years , having honest discussions on how to overhaul the system			0
reforming our immigration laws is not just good economics , it 's also good politics			0
this was made evident on monday when leading @entity4 and @entity5 in the @entity180 came together behind principles that , in their words , would improve our immigration system so that it " will help build the @entity25 economy " and " establish an improved process for admitting future workers to serve our nation 's workforce needs			1
" recruiting the talent we need to compete and succeed in a global marketplace is an idea that crosses party lines			0
opinion : immigrant -- can we trust @entity195 ? @entity25 became the world 's most dynamic and powerful economy by opening our doors to all those seeking freedom and opportunity			2
if we are to retain that position in the 21st century , we must open our doors not only to family members and asylum seekers , but to more of the talented and hard - working people our economy needs to grow			2
this is a moment of progress			0
leading members of both parties in @entity211 understand the need for action and are standing together with an agenda for reform			0
let 's capitalize on it and get the modern immigration system our economy deserves			1
join us on @entity220 / @entity219			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : @entity25 immigration system has n't been *updated* since black and white tv
@entity223 : today our economy is competing on a global scale for the best and brightest
he says other nations offer incentives ; we make it hard for workers to get in
@entity25 ca n't fill @entity100 jobs , he says . we need to lure workers and entrepreneurs
