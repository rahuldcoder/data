over the past week , at least three noteworthy tales surfaced at separate airports			1
the first involves the @entity8 and an unlucky puppet			0

passenger @entity17 , who modeled this particular puppet after the " @entity24 " character in the @entity22 movie " @entity23 , " was carrying the puppet through @entity8 security , and she told @entity0 affiliate king 5 about the incident			0
may said the @entity8 agent told her , " if i held it up to your neck , you would n't know if it was real or not			0
" may 's response was , " really ? " 24 hours at the world 's busiest airport it 's true that realistic replicas of firearms are prohibited in carry - on bags			1
