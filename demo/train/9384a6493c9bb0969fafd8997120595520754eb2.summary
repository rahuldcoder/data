@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity1 president @entity3 has returned to the political stage in @entity1 , which he describes as a " demoralized " nation that needs an injection of vigor and leadership			1
once one of the @entity11 ' strongest allies in the fight against terror , @entity3 on friday launched a new political party in @entity1 as an alternative to an administration he says is now beset with serious problems			1
he cites widespread devastation caused by the spring flooding , a nose - diving economy , and a persistent extremist element , and said the current administration , which he calls corrupt , has n't met those challenges			1
" this is about leading , about support of the people and that 's my strength , " @entity3 said in a @entity25 interview with @entity2 's @entity26			1
it is to be aired friday			0
" i do n't see a political party out there now that is capable of bringing light back in the country			0
we need a new political culture that shuns dynasty politics , " he says , saying that he wants a greater presence of women and minorities participating in the body politic			0
@entity3 resigned in 2008 as @entity1 's ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him , and @entity46 , the widower of assassinated former prime minister @entity47 , succeeded him			2
the former president said he has " strong pockets " of support and there is a " huge clamor " for his return			1
he said his @entity55 page has more than 300,000 followers and he has raised $ 3 million for flood relief , and wants to attract the many people who do n't vote to give him support			2
in fact , he contrasts what he says is the current administration 's inadequate flood response to what he says was his proper reaction to earthquakes in @entity1 several years ago			1
" we turned challenge into opportunity but they have n't done this , " @entity3 said			0
one of the issues in @entity1 is the war in neighboring @entity73 and the fight against militants in northwestern @entity1 who have been involved in the @entity73 insurgency			0
since the @entity80 administration entered office in the @entity11 , drone strikes against militant targets in @entity1 have ramped up			0
@entity3 says he does n't support drone strikes by foreign forces , but does back such actions by @entity1 troops .			2

@entity3 says he has " strong pockets " of support
he *slams* current administration 's flood response
@entity3 cites " huge clamor " for his return
