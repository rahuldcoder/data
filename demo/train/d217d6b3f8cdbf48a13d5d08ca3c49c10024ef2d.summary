-- it took a little longer than most people expected but @entity4 whiz kid @entity3 wrapped up a second world title in @entity6			1
the 21 - year - old finished runner - up behind compatriot @entity7 -- and crucially ahead of the legendary @entity10 @entity9 and @entity11 -- to take an unassailable 82 - point lead in the championship with three rounds to go			1
the landmark means @entity3 beat @entity17 's record , set in 1963 , to become the youngest ever rider to win consecutive titles			1
but perhaps more importantly for his @entity21 team , he did it at @entity23			1
this track is sacred ground for @entity21			2
the @entity6 giants designed and built the track ; it is where they test their cars as well as their bikes , and it also houses @entity21 's museum			1
as such , the pressure to perform here is intense			0
perhaps because of this , no @entity21 rider had ever managed to clinch the championship here -- until now			1
in the end it was an efficient performance from the reigning champion , but there was no sense of inevitability			0
@entity9 blasted into the lead , while a muscular pass from @entity7 saw @entity3 fall back to seventh place on the race 's first corner			1
the champion fought his way up to fourth on the second lap , but @entity7 looked to be a man on a mission , first breaking the lap record and then ducking past his @entity57 teammate @entity9 on lap five to take a lead he would maintain to the line			0
for @entity3 the key was to finish ahead of @entity11 and @entity9 , and gradually he settled into the task			2
easing past his fellow @entity62 , he then closed the gap on the @entity10			2
after 14 laps he finally caught him , but his first attempted pass saw the wily @entity9 immediately bite back to retake second			0
a lap later though and @entity3 took advantage of the @entity21 's superior cornering to slip inside the @entity57 's line			1
it was all he needed to do , and the remaining eight laps saw him cement his place and cross the line in comfort			0
the sea of red - clad @entity3 fans in @entity23 's packed stands erupted			1
@entity3 had talked before about the burden of expectation as his season unfolded , and he appeared as relieved as he was delighted to finally seal the title			1
" two years in @entity4 , two titles			1
it 's incredible , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" i could n't have imagined it			0
" maybe to people it looked easy because i am always smiling and always happy , but also i feel pressure			1
" @entity7 's victory , his second in two races , equals five - time world champion @entity93 's record of 54 grand prix victories , moving him up to him up to joint fifth place in the all - time winners list			1
but his return to form has come too late for him to threaten @entity3 for the championship			2
" we are happy for @entity3 that he won the title , " he said			1
" this year he was the best in general , so we want to say congratulations			0
" @entity9 , enjoying something of an indian summer to his career back at @entity57 , also congratulated the young champion : " i have to say that he deserves this championship			0
he worked well and was the stronger man this year			0
" samurai celebrations @entity4 is a sport that thrives on spectacle , and @entity3 had saved a special treat for his fans at the checkered flag			1
a man in full samurai costume , flanked by two women in geisha dresses , appeared on the track side gravel through a red smoke of fireworks			0
the samurai handed @entity3 a sword , with which the champion cut the string of a balloon bearing the number one			2
a geisha then handed him a gold helmet , which he donned to perform his lap of honor			0
it was a fitting celebration for a truly extraordinary rider			0
sibling rivalry ? since the end of @entity3 's record equaling winning run in @entity142 the @entity4 championship has seen different winners and tight contests , which will have relieved the @entity62 's rivals as well as the sport 's administrators			1
he is still one win short of equallng @entity93 's record of 12 wins in a season , but @entity93 himself warns that the period of @entity3 domination may have just begun			2
" he 's lifted the bar quite substantially this year , " the @entity154 told @entity155			0
" last year he moved it , this year he 's added to that			0
for someone to take away this dominance -- it 's either @entity7 or another guy coming through , and at the moment who 's that ? " it is not an easy question to answer , but contenders are out there			0
and there may be one very close to home			0
it was a double celebration for the @entity3 family as younger brother @entity174 snatched victory in the @entity177 class			2
the junior sibling leads that championship ; the prospect of the brothers fighting for future titles in the premier class is a mouth watering one .			0

@entity3 defends his @entity4 crown with second place in @entity6
the 21 - year - old @entity62 is the youngest rider to win back - to - back world titles
@entity3 is the first @entity21 *driver* to win title at home circuit of @entity23
" i am always smiling and always happy , but also i feel pressure , " says the @entity62
