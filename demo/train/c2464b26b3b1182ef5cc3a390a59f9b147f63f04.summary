@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 braced for a " march of millions " in anti-government protests tuesday as embattled president @entity5 tried to throw up literal and figurative roadblocks in the way of demonstrators calling for his ouster			1
major demonstrations are planned for @entity1 , @entity12 and other cities , the latest in a series of rallies that began a week ago			2
protesters have defied orders for a curfew , and the country 's powerful military announced monday that it would not open fire on peaceful demonstrators			2
a leading opposition figure told @entity2 that the @entity24 needs to be ready to " let go of @entity5 , " a longtime ally			1
" you should n't be behind the curve , and you need to start building confidence with the people , and not with the people who are smothering the people , " @entity26 , the former head of the @entity27 , told @entity2 's " @entity34 360			1
" @entity5 's newly appointed vice president , longtime intelligence chief @entity35 , announced monday that he had begun discussing reform with opposition parties			1
speaking on the state television network , @entity35 said a reform package should be drawn up " expeditiously			0
" " the other parties will also have a role to play , which will lead to real political reform , " @entity35 said			0
but there were no details of what proposals might be on the table , nor was there any immediate reaction from opposition figures or any indication of which parties were taking part			0
and at the same time , the government has shut down the country 's rail network , posted troops at key locations , closed banks and schools and pulled the plug on mobile phone and internet service ahead of tuesday 's protests			2
@entity5 has ruled @entity0 for nearly 30 years under a sweeping emergency decree , imposed after the 1981 assassination of his predecessor , @entity68			1
a wave of protests against his regime erupted following the uprising in @entity73 that ousted its longtime strongman january 14 , and @entity76 secretary - general @entity75 -- @entity5 's former foreign minister -- called monday for a peaceful transition of power " from an era to the other , " the @entity78 news agency @entity77 reported			1
@entity0 's military announced monday evening that it recognized " the legitimate demands of the honest citizens " and would not open fire on peaceful protesters			1
" the presence of the armed forces in the @entity0 streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , " an unnamed spokesman announced on state television monday night			2
" your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of @entity0 's great history			1
" and human rights activist and blogger @entity104 told @entity2 's " @entity109 " that troops are mingling with demonstrators in @entity1 's @entity108			2
" there is no aggressive behavior from the army toward the peaceful assemblies , " he said early tuesday			1
" we hope that within a few hours , the same also will happen			0
we hope the army will not escalate violence against us			0
" though @entity5 has given no indication that he will bow to demands for his ouster , he fired his @entity120 on saturday , and his designation of @entity35 as vice president marks the first time he has filled that post since he came to power in 1981			2
monday , @entity5 swore in @entity126 as the new interior minister to replace @entity128 , who has been criticized by protesters because of police actions			1
others sworn in on monday were finance minister @entity132 , a former economist at the @entity134 , and health minister @entity135			0
@entity132 told @entity2 's " @entity140 " that his priority is " to show that this is a government that responds to the demands -- the fair demands , i would say -- of the people in @entity108			0
" " we need to use public expenditure to achieve some sort of social justice and a better distribution of the fruits of growth , as to the bottom 40 % of this country , " @entity132 said			0
at the same time , he said , @entity0 should n't sacrifice economic reforms and gains " that enabled it to stand the storm of two successive crises -- the food crisis and the financial crisis			1
" state television reported monday that the crisis has cost the country an estimated 69 billion @entity0 pounds ( nearly $ 12 billion ) and set its economy back six months			2
meanwhile , there are international indications that the world could accept a changed @entity0 without @entity5			1
in @entity164 , @entity24 officials have been calling for an " orderly transition " that will include free elections in september , when @entity5 's current term expires			1
" the @entity24 government does not determine who 's on the ballot , " @entity169 spokesman @entity168 told reporters			1
" the question is whether or not those elections are going to be free and fair			0
that 's what we would weigh in on and weigh in on strongly			0
" while it was widely believed @entity5 was grooming his son , @entity179 , as his successor , that plan now has been complicated by demands for democracy			2
@entity26 is one of several opposition figures whose names surface when protesters talk about possible future leaders of @entity0			1
another possibility is @entity75 , a veteran diplomat who was @entity5 's foreign minister until 2001			1
but several opposition movements have been represented on the streets in the demonstrations , and @entity104 said , " there is no leader for the revolution			0
" " there is no political group leading the people			0
there is no one leading the people			0
people are going in a very organic way ... people are just doing it			0
" @entity204 , secretary - general of the @entity205 , told @entity2 the group 's followers have been " extremely active			0
