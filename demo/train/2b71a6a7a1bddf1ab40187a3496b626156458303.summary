@entity0 -- a story that helped catapult the issue of poor work conditions for @entity6 workers at @entity7 -- a primary maker of @entity9 and other devices for @entity11 -- back into the spotlight in january has unraveled			1
an episode of " @entity14 , " a wildly popular @entity16 radio show distributed by @entity17 that is regularly the most downloaded podcast on @entity11 's @entity19 , broadcast an hour - long radio version of monologist @entity23 's " @entity21 of @entity22 , " in which he details a 2010 trip he took to meet workers at @entity7 in @entity26 , @entity6			1
that episode -- which broke records as the most downloaded show of " @entity14 " -- has now been retracted for numerous fabrications , many of which were repeated by @entity33 in subsequent interviews , including one with @entity35			1
the power of @entity33 's storytelling , coupled with a @entity39 investigative series of stories in january , fanned the flames that launched a number of off - and - online protests , including a petition on @entity45 that seeks to " protect workers making iphones in @entity6 factories " that has nearly 250,000 signatures			1
@entity50 : @entity11 and the @entity33 affair but several of @entity33 's dramatic claims , some of which he repeated to @entity1 's @entity56 , have been retracted after @entity33 's @entity6 translator was found by a reporter from " marketplace , " distributed by @entity60 , and disputed his version of events , including : * meeting workers with shaking hands that were poisoned by the chemical n - hexane			1
@entity11 itself acknowledged there were incidents with the chemical at two plants , but not at @entity7			1
* found workers who were as young as 12 years old			1
the translator told public radio they interviewed no underage workers , although some may have looked young			1
@entity11 's 2010 audit found 10 suppliers who hired 91 underage employees out of hundreds of thousands of employees			1
* in one of the show 's most dramatic moments , @entity33 said he interviewed a former worker now handicapped from repetitive stress injuries seeing an @entity9 for the first time , describing it as " a kind of magic			2
" the translator said that never happened			0
questions raised about work conditions at @entity7 are nothing new			2
the electronics supplier -- who also makes electronic goods for @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and other household brands -- came under intense scrutiny by @entity1 and other media outlets in 2010 after a series of suicides at its @entity6 plants			0
@entity33 told public radio that after seeing the news story slip away from public attention , he wanted to create a story that would help sustain interest in the work conditions for overseas makers of popular electronics goods			2
" and everything i have done in making this monologue for the theater has been toward that end -- to make people care			0
i 'm not going to say that i did n't take a few shortcuts in my passion to be heard			0
but i stand behind the work , " @entity33 said			0
" my mistake , the mistake that i truly regret is that i had it on your show as journalism and it 's not journalism			0
i use the tools of theater and memoir to achieve its dramatic arc			0
" but purporting as truth the fabrications of his show in dozens of media interviews has raised a number of questions about the line between drama and journalism			0
" the net result of @entity23 's efforts to put self - promotion ahead of the facts has badly muddied the waters , and has probably done more harm to the people he sought to help , " wrote @entity146 , senior editor for @entity147 " everybody who has touched @entity23 in the past three to four months has been tainted and they need to go back and re-examine their archives , " @entity146 told @entity1 's @entity156			2
@entity161 , host of " marketplace , " which broke the story , said @entity33 's account mixed fact and fiction			0
" @entity23 is a great , great story teller and when you have a guy who spins a web like that and gets you involved , it 's really difficult to take it apart and say , wait a minute , let 's think about this for a second ... what does n't work here ? " he told @entity1			2
" also , there are parts of @entity23 's story that are true -- it does happen that @entity11 has had underage workers ( at its suppliers ) ; it does happen that people have n - hexane poisoning and all that , " he said			1
" but the bottomline is @entity23 tells a great story and people suspended their disbelief			0
