@entity0 fired head basketball coach @entity1 on wednesday after @entity2 broadcast a video showing him physically and verbally abusing players			1
the video , which @entity2 said features excerpts of practice sessions shot between 2010 and 2012 , initially had earned @entity1 a three - game suspension , a $ 75,000 fine and a ticket to anger management classes			1
" you f * * king fairy ... you 're a f * * king fa * * ot , " @entity1 appears to say during one session depicted on the video , which also shows him shoving and throwing basketballs at players			1
under pressure from incensed state officials to take stronger action , athletic director @entity17 said wednesday that he had made a mistake in favoring suspension			0
" i am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of coach @entity1 , " @entity17 said in a written statement			1
" dismissal and corrective action were debated in december and i thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate , but i was wrong			0
moving forward , i will work to regain the trust of the @entity0 community			2
" opinion : @entity0 coach and sports ' bully culture gov. @entity37 , who a spokesman had said was " deeply disturbed " by the video , said wednesday he supports @entity1 's firing			1
" this was a regrettable episode for the university , but i completely support the decision to remove coach @entity1			1
it was the right and necessary action to take in light of the conduct displayed on the videotape , " he said			0
@entity0 president @entity48 said he had agreed last year with an outside investigator 's recommendation that @entity1 be suspended , fined and sent to anger management classes			1
@entity48 , who apparently did not review the video at the time , said he concluded tuesday after viewing it that it showed a " chronic and pervasive pattern of disturbing behavior			2
" " i have now reached the conclusion that coach @entity1 can not continue to serve effectively in a position that demands the highest levels of leadership , responsibility and public accountability , " @entity48 said			1
" he can not continue to coach at @entity0			1
" @entity1 said wednesday after he was fired that " there 's no explanation for what 's on those videos because there 's no excuse for it , " according to @entity71 affiliate @entity70			1
" i ca n't say anything right now except i 'm sorry , and there will never be a time where i 'm going to use any of that as an excuse or will there be any excuse , " he said , according to the station			0
" i 've let so many people down , my players , my administration , @entity0 , the fans , my family -- who 's sitting in their house , just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them			1
" coach is seen and heard abusing team ' total shock ' @entity2 got the video from former @entity96 player @entity95 , the team 's former player development director			1
he told the network the school fired him for blowing the whistle on @entity1			2
the school says he was let go for " insubordinate conduct " unrelated to the video , according to @entity2			1
in the video , @entity1 is shown several times throwing basketballs at flinching players , shoving one in the back , kicking at another			1
he frequently berates players in the clips			0
" to see your coach physically putting his hands on players , physically kicking players , firing balls at players from point - blank range , the verbal abuse , the belittling , i was in total shock that this guy was n't fired , immediately on the spot , " @entity95 told @entity2			1
but @entity124 , who played at @entity0 under @entity1 , told @entity71 what 's in the video was n't the norm at practices			1
" from time to time , there 's some instances of throwing balls or physically making contact with players , but it only occurred from time to time , it was n't an everyday type thing , " he told @entity71			1
" obviously , the video shows it happened , but they were isolated incidents			2
they were n't back to back			0
" what we can learn from @entity0 ' former coach ' not acceptable ' efforts by @entity71 to reach @entity1 and @entity17 on wednesday were unsuccessful			1
but @entity17 previously told @entity71 affiliate @entity143 that @entity1 's conduct was " unacceptable and is not to the @entity0 standard			1
" " that 's why we handed out the significant amount of suspension that we did and all the things that came along with that , " he said			0
" i think it will affect @entity1 wherever he goes , " @entity17 told the station tuesday			1
" it certainly affects his tenure			0
we 're trying to do everything we can to support him			0
but we also had to penalize him within the process too because there are certain words that are said and actions that are taken that are not acceptable no matter who you are and where you work and certainly not @entity0			2
" students interviewed wednesday were pleased by @entity1 's firing			1
the abuse " should have never happened , " junior @entity167 told @entity71			2
" that guy should have been gone the first month			0
it just does n't look good for @entity0			2
" " i 'm surprised he kept his job for what , it 's like five months after the video was released , " junior @entity171 said			2
on @entity178 , the decision to fire @entity1 also seemed widely regarded as too little , too late			2
" i always find it really admirable when someone can do the right thing when everyone is looking , " @entity178 user @ adamcox wrote			0
" my question is why was n't he dismissed last year , " wrote @ @entity184			0
similar incident the video recalled the 2000 sacking of legendary @entity191 basketball coach @entity190 in the aftermath of a videotaped incident in which he put his hand to the throat of a player			1
while it was another incident that finally led to @entity190 's firing , it was the videotaped 1997 incident that prompted strict limits on the coach 's frequent physical and verbal outbursts and set the stage for @entity191 to let him go			1
it also sparked discussion about how far coaches should go to motivate players , what message such behavior sends to young athletes and how widespread such behavior is in locker rooms and practice facilities			0

" you can walk on any sideline almost anywhere in @entity236 or @entity237 , on any given weekend , and see similar behaviors			0
" @entity227 , a former @entity96 player who acknowledged he was gay in a 2007 book , called such conduct abusive , and said @entity1 should be fired			0
" there is no context in the universe where that kind of behavior is acceptable			0
it 's physical and verbal abuse			0
it 's psychological and emotional abuse , " he said			0
" he should not be allowed near anybody			0
i mean forget sports , there is no context where his management style is appropriate			0
" but , he said , such demeaning language is not uncommon in sports			0
nor is a coach like @entity1 rare , @entity227 said			2
" he 's just rarely exposed , " he said			0
