@entity9 , who headed @entity20 's @entity19 before joining the @entity11 , said a two - speed economy was emerging , but that could be seen as a " major rebalancing			1
" when he began at the @entity11 in 2003 , @entity23 was the sick man of @entity3 due to its lack of competitiveness , @entity9 said			1
the country has since emerged as the eurozone 's power player , and a lead negotiator in the four - year old financial crisis			2
according to @entity9 , @entity3 has been adjusting after " countries that went too far too rapidly , had bubbles and so forth ... now those countries that were growing extremely fast , abnormally fast , [ and ] a lot of them are correcting			1
" however , member countries are not always going at the " same time , at the same speed , " @entity9 said			2
@entity12 who stepped up as @entity40 's " technocrat " prime minister after the country 's economic instability forced the resignation of @entity45 , told quest his greater concern was the prospect of a two class @entity3			1

this " psychological conflict of north versus south and vice versa , this needs to be tackled			2
" @entity9 echoed the concerns , telling @entity64 such a split was " absolutely unacceptable			1
" " if we had , in the past , fully implemented the rules including the stability and growth pact , and what was badly needed -- control and monitoring of competitiveness -- we would n't have two class @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity14 , meanwhile , said his fear was that " after the crisis those who were , at the beginning of this crisis , at the bottom , would continue to be at the bottom			2
" however , he added , that would not happen if the countries in recession " do what they have started to do and ...			0

" @entity23 's emergence as power player @entity23 emerged as an economic force after labor reforms were implemented under its then - chancellor @entity92			0
now , its export - led economy drives the 17 - nation eurozone , with chancellor @entity52 -- battling for third term in this weekend 's federal elections -- a central figure during @entity3 's crisis			1
@entity52 's popularity remains high in @entity23 , and her party , the @entity100 , is expected to gain the most votes			0

" as it is , @entity23 remains shackled to the weaker countries in the euro , many of which continue to struggle with spiralling unemployment , high national debts and growing political instability			0
@entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 have received over 400 billion euros ( $ 534 billion ) in bailout packages from the euro - area 's rescue funds			0
last year @entity3 finance ministers approved a 39.5 billion euro ( $ 51.6 billion ) lifeline for @entity139 's banks , struggling after the property bubble went bust			2

the imbalance had created a system " where the creditor nations rule and impose their conditions and the others are subservient to that , " @entity163 , a professor at the @entity164 , told @entity0			0
" at some point , these countries will not continue to accept this recipe			0
" the common currency 's future public opinion continues to support the political push to integrate the eurozone , @entity14 said			1
discontent shown by the region 's constituents is " with the way the @entity3 institutions tried to solve the problems , " he said			1
indeed , despite efforts to tie the bloc closer , debate continues around the potential for worst affected countries to exit the common currency			0
such an outcome has been decried in the past but could , according to @entity193 faculty member @entity192 , be of benefit			0
@entity192 said the bloc needed to " go for strong political integration , to basically create a single market or a strong fiscal policy , or get rid of the euro			0
" otherwise , @entity192 said , " my fear is ...			0
people in these countries that have problems will turn violently against @entity3			2
" meanwhile , according to @entity12 , the region 's leaders must work more closely together			1
leaders who applaud decisions made in @entity209 only to criticize them from home turf are playing a dangerous game , he said			0
