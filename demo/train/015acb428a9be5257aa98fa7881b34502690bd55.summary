-- if every end results in a new beginning , then the start of the next race for the @entity3 begins now			0
with the midterm elections barely behind them , the dozen or more possible contenders for the 2012 @entity8 presidential nomination no longer have to keep up the charade that all of their activity on the campaign trail over the past couple of months was solely about helping fellow @entity8 this year and had nothing to do with the next race for the @entity3			1
among those considering presidential bids who were criss - crossing the country were @entity23 governor and @entity25 chairman @entity22 , who made a five - day , 13 - state swing in support of @entity8 gubernatorial candidates ; former @entity30 governor and 2008 @entity8 presidential candidate @entity29 , who campaigned for @entity8 in 25 states since august ; @entity34 gov. @entity33 , who made a seven - day eight - state tour ; and former house speaker @entity36 , who finished up a 12 - state , two - week tour			1
other potential @entity3 hopefuls on the campaign trail this fall for fellow @entity8 : sen. @entity41 of @entity42 ; former sen. @entity43 of @entity44 ; former @entity46 governor and 2008 @entity8 presidential candidate @entity45 , now a talk - show host ; rep. @entity48 of @entity49 ; rep. @entity50 of @entity51 , who also ran for his party 's last presidential nomination ; and former @entity55 governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee @entity56			1
for those thinking about bidding for the @entity3 , the midterms served partially as a pregame show			1
" potential 2012 candidates can point to their 2010 travel and fundraising efforts when they 're asked ' where were you when we needed you ? ' by elected @entity8 and activists whose support they 're courting in caucuses and primaries just over a year from now , " says @entity60 , a @entity25 strategist who was national press secretary for @entity29 's 2008 presidential campaign			2
so does the end of the 2010 election cycle mean that those interested in running for the @entity3 will immediately launch bids ? yes and no. many of the bigger names who may announce a bid for the presidency have said they wo n't decide on a @entity3 run until early next year			1
but some of the lesser - known candidates may launch exploratory committees soon after the midterms , as some did in the last cycle			0
and get ready for a pickup in the frequency of 2012 presidential polling			2
" we all probably agree it will be too soon to start speculating about 2012 starting on november 3 , but that wo n't stop folks from doing it anyway , " @entity60 said			2
while many @entity25 hopefuls may not immediately declare themselves as candidates , what will be felt immediately in the battle for the @entity8 presidential nomination is the effect of the @entity103 movement			1
" hard - charging @entity103 candidates came out of nowhere , beat out establishment @entity8 candidates in the primaries , and won general election contests			0
that 's a wake - up call for @entity25 establishment candidates for president , " says @entity0 contributor and @entity25 strategist @entity109			0
while the @entity103 added energy and enthusiasm to the @entity8 , it may have also changed the way the @entity8 choose their presidential nominee			2
" we always pick the guy who ran last time and nearly won			0
the election may have turned that dynamic on its head , " @entity109 said			0
follow @entity123 on @entity124 : @ @entity125			0
