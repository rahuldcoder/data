-- after more than six months of silence , @entity2 's leader , @entity1 , spoke last week for only the fourth time since the beginning of the country 's widespread uprising in march			1
his words show that he is as delusional now as when the protests began			0
by continuing to blame the revolution on a foreign conspiracy , dismissing hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens as " bandits , @entity15 and @entity16 , " @entity1 is taking a page out of the handbook of @entity20 's late dictator , @entity19 , on political survival			1
@entity1 will fight to the end simply because he can not even conceive of his end			2
" victory is nigh , " @entity1 assured his dwindling supporters			2
but the current standstill after 10 months of fighting against unarmed protesters , and the deaths of more than 5,000 people , makes this promise hollow			1
indeed , @entity1 's recent call on loyalists to continue to form local units to support the army and the security forces in their crackdown clearly shows increasing difficulty for the regime			1
without external support , the protest movement has proved impossible to defeat , even for @entity1 's machine of oppression , deemed by international human rights organizations to be one of the worst in the @entity46			2
@entity1 's best defense at this stage is to play the hackneyed hand of dictators in the region -- and he is pursuing it assiduously by stoking international fears of civil mayhem in @entity2			1
the @entity55 and the international community do not seem to know how to respond , other than to impose economic sanctions , followed by more economic sanctions			2
the sanctions , though effective in crippling @entity2 's economy , have proved useless at stopping the bloodshed			1
if anything , violence is escalating , its ferocity forcing the previously unarmed protesters to rally around the increasing number of @entity67 defectors to organize an armed resistance to loyalist militias			0
as for the @entity72 delegation of monitors roaming the country to ensure compliance with an agreement to halt the violence against protesters , the average daily death toll has more than doubled , reaching around 50 innocent people , since the monitors arrived in late december			2
there are vital steps the @entity55 can immediately take			2
ragtag defectors from the @entity67 , joined by civilians , have had to fight back			0
yet these unorganized protesters have fought @entity1 's loyalist troops and militias nearly to a standstill with only light arms , obtained locally			1
providing them with more sophisticated gear , including rpgs , night vision goggles and better communication equipment , would likely enable them to neutralize @entity1 's tanks and possibly free entire towns			1
implementing a no - fly zone could also prevent @entity1 from laying these towns , once free , to waste			1
a naval blockade of @entity2 ports would help prevent arms shipments to the regime			1
these are all measures the protesters themselves have forcefully and uniformly requested			0
some might be concerned that the prospect of increased militarization will plunge @entity2 into civil war			0
@entity1 is leaving his opponents with little choice			0
either they must settle for his version of reform , forever keeping him and his inner circle in power and above the law , or they are " terrorists " and will be struck with an " iron fist , " as he threatened last week			0
if @entity117 persists in threatening a veto at the @entity119 , the @entity55 should call for an international conference on @entity2 , with the @entity72 , the @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and all concerned states			1
this would be a viable path to legitimate multilateral intervention while circumventing the @entity117 veto			0
@entity2 opposition coalitions , such as the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) and the @entity133 , and prominent independent dissidents should be also invited , so that they can endorse the outcome and legitimate any international actions against the @entity2 regime			1
the protesters and all @entity2 who yearn for freedom are @entity140 in their call for international intervention			2
@entity55 faces a fundamental choice			0
it can stand behind democratic aspirations fully , or it can continue to rely on 19th century notions of power politics and influence			0
backing tyrants as a hedge against @entity152 extremism has only fostered more extremism			0
although the course of history is never smooth or predictable , supporting freedom , democracy and individual dignity will , over time , provide the most stable model for prosperity and peace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

they say a no - fly zone , naval blockade of @entity2 ports would be effective
