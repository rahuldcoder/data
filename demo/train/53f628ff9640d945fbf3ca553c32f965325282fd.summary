traitor or patriot ? low - level systems analyst or highly trained spy ? slammed by top @entity5 government officials and facing espionage charges in the @entity5 , former @entity9 contractor @entity7 described how he sees himself during an interview with @entity11 " broadcast wednesday			1
and he defended his decision to leak documents about classified @entity5 government surveillance programs			2
we 've heard from @entity7 a few times before , but the @entity11 interview with anchor @entity18 inside a @entity20 hotel was his first on an @entity5 television network			1
here are 10 key points from the interview with the 30 - year - old former @entity9 contractor : 1			1
@entity7 thinks he 's a patriot			1
" i think patriot is a word that 's thrown around so much that it can be devalued nowadays , " he said			1
" being a patriot does n't mean prioritizing service to government above all else			1
being a patriot means knowing when to protect your country , knowing when to protect your @entity35 , knowing when to protect your countrymen , from the violations of and encroachments of adversaries			2
and those adversaries do n't have to be foreign countries			2
" that assessment drew a sharp response from @entity5 secretary of state @entity44 , who spoke with @entity11 earlier wednesday			1
" @entity45 do n't go to @entity46			1
they do n't seek asylum in @entity49			2
they do n't seek asylum in @entity52			2
they fight their cause here , " @entity44 said			0
" @entity7 is a coward			1
and he has betrayed his country			0
and if he wants to come home tomorrow to face the music , he can do so			0
@entity7 says he was trained as a spy			1
@entity5 president @entity59 famously referred to @entity7 as a hacker last year , and other officials have described him as a low - ranking analyst			1
that 's misleading , @entity7 said			1
" i was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that i lived and worked undercover , overseas , pretending to work in a job that i 'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine , " @entity7 said			1
" now , the government might deny these things			2
they might frame it in certain ways , and say , oh , well , you know , he 's a low - level analyst			2
but what they 're trying to do is they 're trying to use one position that i 've had in a career , here or there , to distract from the totality of my experience			0
@entity46 is n't where he expected to end up , but he 's managing			1
" i personally am surprised that i ended up here , " @entity7 said			1
" the reality is i never intended to end up in @entity46			2
i had a flight booked to @entity49 onwards to @entity93 , and i was stopped because the @entity5 government decided to revoke my passport and trap me in the @entity20 airport			2
" there 's a culture gap , and it 's been an adjustment			0
" but even though i did n't choose to be here , even though circumstances really trapped me here , i can adapt			0
i can live life as an @entity5 more or less			0
that 's the beauty of the @entity104 is that we 're no longer tied to our communities by physical connections , " he said			0
like a lot of us , he 's been spending his free time watching old episodes of " @entity112			0
" " i 'm really enjoying it , " he said , though he added that the second season is " not so great			0
he 's not happy about some things the @entity46 government is doing			1
@entity7 says he has no ties with the @entity46 government , and he is n't happy with some of its policies			1
" it 's really frustrating for someone who 's working so hard to expand the domain of our rights and our privacy to end up stuck in a place where those rights are being challenged in ways that i would consider deeply unfair , " he said			0
there 's no good reason , for example , for a recent law requiring bloggers to register in @entity46 , he said			1
" i ca n't think of any basis for a law like that , not just in @entity46 , but any country , " he said			1
" the government should n't regulate the operations of a free press			2
" so why does n't he do something about it			0
" there 's so much that needs to be defended here in @entity46 , but i 'm limited by my inability to speak @entity46 , and so on			1
it 's an isolating and frustrating thing			0
it only takes a cell phone for spy agencies in the @entity5 and other countries to find out a lot about you if they want to			0
and that 's even if you 're just googling something simple , @entity7 said , like a sports score ( @entity18 told @entity7 he 'd recently searched for the score of a @entity163 game )			1
" the @entity9 , the @entity46 intelligence service , the @entity164 intelligence service , any intelligence service in the world that has significant funding and a real technological research team can own that phone the minute it connects to their network , " @entity7 said			1
they can turn on a phone remotely if it 's off , he said			0
and even a detail like a @entity175 search for a sports score can reveal a lot about you			0
" you probably speak @entity179			0
you are probably an @entity5			0
you are interested in this sport			0
they might know what your habits are , " @entity7 said			2
' where were you in the world when you checked the score ? do you check it when you travel ? do you check it when you 're at home ? they could tell your pattern of life			0
where are you doing these activities ? when do you wake up ? when do you go to sleep ? what other phones are around you ? are you with someone who 's not your wife ? are you someplace that you should n't be ? " 7			2
he wants to return to the @entity5 someday			0
" if i could go anywhere in the world , that place would be home , " he said			0
but he responded with a series of questions rather than specifics when asked what he missed about home			0
" what do n't i miss ? what would you miss ? what would n't you miss ? " he said			0
" i miss my family			0
so why does n't he come back to the @entity5 to face charges ? @entity7 says that 's a fair question , but an ignorant one			1
because he was charged under the @entity219 , @entity7 says he has no chance to make a public defense of his case			2
" you are not allowed to argue based on all the evidence in your favor because that evidence may be classified , " he said			0
" when people say , ' why do n't you face the music ? ' i say , ' you have to understand the music is not an open court and a fair trial			0
why did @entity7 leak classified documents ? he says he had no choice			2
" the reality is , the situation determined that this needed to be told to the public			0
the @entity35 of the @entity5 had been violated on a massive scale , " @entity7 told @entity18			1
" now , had that not happened , had the government not gone too far and overreached , we would n't be in a situation where whistleblowers were necessary			2
" the @entity5 government , @entity7 said , is using the threat of terrorism " to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe but cost us liberties and freedoms that we do n't need to give up and our @entity35 says we should n't give up			1
he says he tried to go through official channels before leaking information but met dead ends			0
among the people he contacted , @entity7 said , was the @entity9 's general counsel office			1
" i reported that there were real problems with the way the @entity9 was interpreting its legal authorities , " @entity7 said			1
" and the response , more or less , in bureaucratic language was , ' you should stop asking questions			0
' " on thursday , the @entity9 released what it said was a copy of an e-mail exchange between @entity7 and its general counsel office			1
@entity7 's e-mail asked for clarification of training course material and " did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse , " according to the @entity276 .			1
