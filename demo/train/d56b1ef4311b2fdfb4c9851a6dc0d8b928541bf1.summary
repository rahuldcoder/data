@entity1 , @entity0 -- the vast majority of comedians lean to the left			1
right - wing comedy is a rarity on the @entity8			1
and @entity9 are typically easier to make fun of than @entity11			0
but comedians should n't take a political stance when trying to be funny			1
that was the consensus of a panel of admittedly left - leaning comedy experts at @entity17 , the digital culture festival under way in this @entity0 capital			1
" comedy has a recklessness that does n't lend itself to the conservative lifestyle , " said @entity21 , an executive producer and writer for " @entity23 with @entity24			1
" " it 's the same reason why christian rock bands are n't as good as regular rock bands			1
" @entity21 was joined on the panel by @entity32 , comedy editor of @entity34 , and comedian - author @entity35 , a contributor to @entity37 -- although @entity38 did most of the talking			1
during a freewheeling hour , the trio riffed on everything from the nature of humor online to @entity9 candidate @entity45 's recent comment that president @entity46 is " a snob " for wanting young people to attend college			2
@entity21 admitted that after eight years of making jokes about president @entity52 , it was difficult at first for " @entity23 " to take aim at @entity46			0
he said @entity46 's measured statements are n't easy targets for parody			1
" there 's funny stuff on the left , but sometimes you have to dig a little deeper			1
i ca n't say all the lies in politics come from the right			2
i think a lot of them come from the left , " he said during the event friday			2
" i do think it 's important to try and come at things from all sides			2
what we do is poke fun at the [ political ] system , poke fun at the process			0
" panelists agreed that partisan politics has almost nothing to do with what 's funny online			0
" i do n't think the @entity8 leans left , " said @entity21 , citing the @entity81 and the far - right rhetoric in some online - comment threads			1
" it 's a bad idea [ for comedy sites ] to pick a path politically before they go after what 's funny			1
" @entity35 agreed , saying there 's a reason most of the most popular clips on @entity92 do n't feature politics but cute cats and guys getting smacked in the groin			2
yet asked by moderator @entity98 to name a single right - leaning comedy site , the panel drew a blank			1
they also could n't name any conservative comedians , save for maybe @entity103			1
@entity32 said most of the comedians she knows are questioning , angst - ridden people whose insecurities may not jibe with conservative mind - sets			1
@entity21 said the 2011 - 2012 @entity9 primary campaign , with such colorful candidates as @entity110 and @entity111 , has been comic gold for " @entity23 " and other jokesters			0
" with all due respect to the candidates , there is the view that all of them are insane			0
a guy like @entity45 , who 's taking an anti-college stance ? that 's funny			0
i mean , who the f --- is against college ? " satirical tv shows such as " @entity23 " and " @entity127 " can raise viewers ' awareness about political issues			0
but @entity21 believes they should n't be someone 's only source of news			2
" when people say , ' i get all my news from ' @entity23 , ' i say , ' well , that 's a good start			0
' it 's a launching point			0
but it 's not a place to form your opinions			0
" @entity32 believes social media has democratized comedy by giving everyone a platform to be funny -- whether it 's in @entity147 updates , in brief @entity149 jokes or goofy images on @entity151			2
" people just naturally want to make other people laugh , " she said			0
" it 's hard to find an audience when you want to be funny			2
when you 're a kid , it 's your family			0
but when you 're an adult , the @entity8 gives you a constant audience			0
it may just be 20 friends on @entity147 , but it 's an audience			0

it 's not easy to find right - leaning comedians or comedy websites , comedy experts say
says one , comedy 's " recklessness *...* does n't lend itself to the conservative lifestyle "
admittedly left - leaning experts spoke on a panel at the @entity17 *conference*
