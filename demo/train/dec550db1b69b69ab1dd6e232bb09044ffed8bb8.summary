with lingering questions about privacy , game trading and selling , and an " always - on " @entity5 device , @entity0 has released new details about the new @entity8 console , hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar			1
the details come a week before the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) next week in @entity14 and , presumably , are meant to free up the company to focus on games and features , not consumer concerns , during its major showcase there			2
among the new details : up to 10 family members will be able to log in and play purchased @entity8 games from anywhere			1
the unique proposition addresses concerns from fans about being able to play where they want , and when they want , in an era when game companies worry about protecting digital rights			0
the games also will be playable by anyone who uses the console at the buyer 's house			0
but what about used games ? one blog post emphasizes there will be no fee for transferring or selling games back for cash and credit on @entity0 's part			2
however , the wording suggests that restrictions could come from game publishers themselves			1
" today , some gamers choose to sell their old disc - based games back for cash and credit			0
we designed @entity8 so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers , " the post reads			1
" @entity0 does not charge a platform fee to retailers , publishers , or consumers for enabling transfer of these games			1
" @entity0 uses the same " game publisher can enable " language when talking about trading or giving games to your friends			2
there are two requirements on trading from @entity0 : the recipient must be on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given away once			2
what will game publishers do with this new control over used games and trading ? and how will retailers , who rely on game trades as part of their business , react ? that remains to be seen			1
in releasing the new details , @entity0 seeks to take the spotlight off of itself and aim it at third - party publishers			1
at the end of the day , it 's those publishers who have the most to lose if games on new consoles like the @entity8 , and @entity97 's upcoming @entity98 , do n't have built - in protections that keep them from being resold or shared			1
but digital - rights management and other protections are unpopular with many gamers , who argue they should be able to do what they like with a game once they 've paid for it			0
it 's unclear how @entity0 's own @entity108 will address those issues			0
@entity97 has been less open about how rights issues will be managed on its own new console			0
on the @entity8 , offline gaming or use of a constant internet connection has also been an issue for fans			0
according to another post , while the @entity8 is designed to work best with a constant broadband connection , it is not required			2
however , the console will need to be connected at least once every 24 hours , or once an hour if you 're logged onto a friend 's console to access your own game library			0
a separate blog post addressed the privacy concerns raised by an always - watching @entity5 device , which is connected to the @entity8			2
gamers will be able to tailor how responsive the sensor will be and how much or little data gets transferred			0
the @entity5 device can be paused if you do n't want to use it			0
also , while the @entity5 can indeed read your heart rate , facial expressions and more , none of that data leaves the console without explicit permission			0
the post goes on to say that @entity0 is listening to fan feedback as they refine and develop new policies for the @entity8			1
@entity0 's @entity13 presentation is scheduled for monday at 12:30p.m			1

ahead of @entity13 , @entity0 answers questions about @entity8 **rules**
up to 10 family members will be able to access a game anywhere
**rules** on sharing , *reselling* will be up to game publishers
" always - on " @entity159 is *preferable* , but not required , for the @entity8
