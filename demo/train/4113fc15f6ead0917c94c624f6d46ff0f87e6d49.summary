-- @entity1 knows the forests of @entity3 in @entity4 like the back of his hand			1
the 360 - square - kilometer sanctuary is home to hundreds of plant species , as well as endangered animals including , leopards , elephants , hornbills , african grey parrots and many more			1
but while @entity1 now proudly walks through the sanctuary as a tour guide , he gained his knowledge of the reserve a different way : as a poacher			0
it was 15 years ago that he decided to go from hunter to protector , but says that his decision to change his ways at first endangered his own life			0
fellow villagers and other poachers threatened to shoot him , he says , because he " let them down			1
" now however many more have thanked him for showing that conservation and tourism can provide other ways to make a living from the forest			0
the national reserve and its tourism industry have created jobs for people from the 52 surrounding villages , which in turn brings more sustainable income to their communities			0

within 20 years , it has become a must - see tourist spot in the country , attracting an average of 180,000 visitors every year			0
for tourists the main draw is the so - called canopy walkway			1
the series of hanging bridges stretches 350 meters long , connecting seven treetops			1
the swaying walkway -- reaching as high as 40 meters above the ground -- tests one 's nerves , but it does offer a stunning vantage point of the forest 's diverse flora and fauna			2
just outside @entity71 lies farmland , which can lead to conflicts between villagers and wild animals , particularly elephants that wander beyond the park 's boundaries and raid the crops			2
conservation officials have taught farmers in the area to build chili fences , a low - tech method , around their fields to deter crop - raiding elephants			2
but few farmers adopt the measures , with many saying they face financial constraints and insufficient knowledge to install and maintain the fences			0
plus , old habits die hard			0
some of the locals also still treat the forest as their hunting grounds as bush meat is a common source of protein in @entity47			0

@entity4 's rapidly dwindling rainforests and biodiversity face threats from poaching , as well as illegal logging			2
slash - and - burn agriculture is still common in @entity4 , as in other parts of @entity47			1
mineral mining , both large and small in scale , also exacts a toll on the rainforests			0
while @entity4 has seen success in reducing elephant poaching and illegal ivory trade , but it still struggles to clamp down on bush - meat hunting			1
increased access to forests has helped create an even bigger market that transcends national borders			0
by one estimate , bush - meat trade in @entity4 reaches $ 350 million a year			1
but for now , @entity4 -- like many other countries like in the world , from @entity127 to @entity128 -- has turned to converted hunters like @entity1 to help conserve its precious wildlife			2
