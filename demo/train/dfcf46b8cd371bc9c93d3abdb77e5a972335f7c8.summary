-- on wednesday , @entity2 author @entity1 received permission to build the most amazing tree houses ever seen on the face of this planet ( and probably any other )			1
the tree houses , which , stand two stories tall and include a rope bridge , turrets and secret tunnels			1
and you thought your yellow slide was cool			1
instead of being overwhelmed by seething jealously , however ( okay , maybe there was just a moment of weakness ) , we at @entity17 started brainstorming what @entity2 creations we 'd like to see in our own homes			1
who knows ? maybe @entity1 will get wind of this post and do something about it			1
' cause if anyone 's got the money to make it happen , it 's her			1
the @entity31 : i always forget to turn the bathroom light off			2
and every night , i lay in bed letting the yellow light annoy me until i find the will to get up and go out into the hallway to turn it off			2
then , i inevitably trip over my backpack , shoes , discarded clothing , or @entity42 on my way back			2
the @entity31 would end all this			2
just a click of the switch and all the lights in the house would be off			2
the @entity51 ' bathroom : the bathtub is the size of a swimming pool			0
all the taps run different colored bath water			0
there is a tap dedicated to just bubbles			0
just bubbles , you guys ! you would never have to struggle to obtain to perfect bubbles to water ratio			0
( this is surprisingly difficult			0
dishes that clear themselves : the dishwasher may clean our plates for us ( if you 're lucky enough to have one ) , but could you imagine if your dishes just emptied when you were done ? if they were suddenly spotlessly clean , with absolutely no effort on your part ? come on , even putting the dishes in the dishwasher can be tiresome sometimes			1
with this , you could just stick them back in the cabinet right when you 're finished ! amazing ! 4			0
the @entity81 : remember that time you tried to sneak out to @entity83 ' party ? and then you were caught by your parents and grounded for a week ? ( i do			0
) that would never happen if you had a map to tell you where everyone in your house is			0
the knight bus : not technically for the home , but it will certainly get you there faster			0
monster chess : actually , this already exists			0
what would you wish for , @entity98 ? sound off below ! see full story at @entity0			1
