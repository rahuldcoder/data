-- emblazoned with a red @entity1 and calling itself " 2083 : a @entity10 declaration of @entity11 , " the 1,518 - page manifesto alleged to have been written by the suspect in shootings and bombings that left at least 92 people dead in @entity8 rambles from ways that " @entity17 " can avoid detection by police to relatives ' sexually transmitted diseases			1
here are key points from the document , which @entity0 has not independently confirmed was written by suspect @entity20 : -- the writer describes himself as " @entity22 knight commander for @entity23 and one of several leaders of the @entity26 and @entity27			1
" -- he anticipates a @entity10 civil war taking place in three stages , ending in 2083 with the execution of cultural @entity33 and the deportation of @entity35			1
-- the first stage runs through 2030 and includes " open source warfare , military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems ( and ) further consolidation of conservative forces			1
" -- between 2030 and 2070 , the author predicts " more advanced forms of resistance groups ( and the ) preparation for pan-european coup d'etats			2
" -- the final stage -- when the author anticipates @entity10 being 30 % -50 % muslim by country -- features the " execution of cultural @entity53 / multiculturalist ... traitors , " deportation of @entity35 and " implementation of a cultural conservative political agenda " following the overthrow of existing governments across the continent			1
-- the author says he personally has been attacked repeatedly by @entity35 : " i 've ' only ' experienced 8 assaults , attempted robberies and multiple threats			2
i 've never actually been severely ravaged , robbed or beaten my @entity35 ( a broken nose is the worst thing that occurred ) but i know more than 20 people who have			2
i know at least 2 girls that have been raped my @entity35 and i am familiar with two more cases in my broader network ( 1 gang rape )			2
one girl though was cut badly in the face by @entity35			2
" -- he lists accused @entity76 genocide suspect @entity75 among the people he would like to meet , denying that @entity75 is " a mass murderer and a racist , " saying instead that " for his efforts to rid @entity80 of @entity81 he will always be considered and remembered as an honourable crusader and a @entity10 war hero			1
" -- the author accuses @entity8 prime minister @entity86 and his @entity87 of perpetuating " cultural marxist / multiculturalist ideals " and indoctrinating youth with those ideals			1
-- " the situation is just chaotic , " the author writes , noting that " thousands of @entity35 " are coming into his country annually			2
" these suicidal traitors must be stopped , " the author writes			0
-- the manifesto speculates about what would happen if the author were to survive " a successful mission and live to stand a multiculturalist trial ...			1
when i wake up at the hospital , after surviving the gunshot wounds inflicted me , i realize at least for me personally , i will be waking up to a world of shit , a living nightmare			0
not only will all my friends and family detest me and call me a monster ; the united global multiculturalist media will have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate , vilify and demonize			0
" -- the author says he prefers fantasy video role - playing games to ones where the player sees through the eyes of someone shooting enemies , writing : " i 'm generally more the fantasy @entity122 kind of person -- @entity125 etc. and not so much into first person shooters			1
" -- the author states that he was moved to action dating to " my government 's involvement " in @entity132 's 1999 strikes during the @entity134 campaign , claiming this wrongly targeted " our @entity80 brothers ( who ) wanted to drive @entity81 out by deporting the @entity138 @entity35 back to @entity138			0
" -- " be extra careful when researching for bomb schematics ( fertilizer bombs ) , as many terms will trigger electronic alerts , " he writes , one of several tips that include using an " anonymous laptop and browse free to your local @entity147 " in order to " avoid ending up on any watch list			0
" -- besides hands - on instructions , the document also functions as a running diary			1
it also includes references to his relatives ' sexual indiscretions , entries on some of his friends ' personal lives , and his own off - and - on steroid use			1
-- from july 2 on , though , the author becomes more business - like and complains that going off his testosterone supplements had ramped up his " aggressiveness			1
" he then digs up his guns and prepares the bombs			0
it all leads up to july 22 , the date of the attacks			0
" the old saying ' if you want something done , then do it yourself ' is as relevant now as it was then , " he writes			0
" in many cases ; you could do it all yourself , it will just take a little more time			0
and , without taking unacceptable risks			0
" -- the last entry is dated the day of the attack : " i believe this will be my last entry			0
it is now fri july 22nd , 12.51			0
