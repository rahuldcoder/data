-- once again , the eyes of the nation are upon @entity3			1
when it comes to political news and the occasional shenanigan , our second most populous state always seems to come in first			1
the latest dust - up in the @entity3 is about women 's reproductive rights			1
the @entity13 minority last week stopped a bill being pushed by the @entity16 majority that would have shut down most of the state 's abortion clinics and banned abortion in the state after 20 weeks			2
but the ruckus is also about saying the wrong thing in the wrong way , and coming off like a jerk in the process			0
it 's about etiquette and character , and how intensely unlikable a politician can become when he is running low on both			2
@entity31 counts for a lot in politics			0
voters often make choices about which candidate to support based on whether we can relate to them or feel comfortable around them			0
meanwhile , a lot of @entity41 feel uncomfortable about late - term abortion			2
it 's a barbaric procedure that opponents consider infanticide			2
it 's also where many people like me , who are pro-choice , draw the line			2
the @entity13 ' victory in the legislature is credited to sen. @entity52 , who staged an 11 - hour filibuster to push the debate past the stroke of midnight and the end of a special session			1
the victory was short - lived			2
gov. @entity59 called a second special session to allow @entity16 legislators more time to get the legislation passed and onto his desk , where he is eager to sign it			1
this high - stakes game of @entity65 could well be a preview of the 2014 matchup for the state 's top job			1
at one end of the table sits @entity73			0
a rising star in the @entity13 who represents @entity76 , she has long been thought to be interested in running for governor			0
now , thanks to @entity16 attempts to shut her down , she has an issue			0
the campaign ad writes itself : " @entity73 bravely stood up to the @entity16 majority , and backed them down			0
" at the other end , you 'll find @entity59			1
i wrote for the @entity88 for five years			0
and i know this much : the governor has always been a paradox			0
one on one , he 's very effective			2
he 's charming and personable , and easy to relate to			2
but when he steps into his public persona , as in debates or at press conferences , he becomes less likable			0
out goes the class president , and in comes the schoolyard bully			0
it was the latter that showed up when @entity59 addressed the @entity100 conference in @entity101 , @entity3 , near @entity102 , a few days after @entity73 ' filibuster			1
obviously still smarting from the setback , @entity59 fired off these condescending remarks : " who are we to say that children born in the worst of circumstances ca n't grow to live successful lives ? in fact , even the woman who filibustered the @entity112 the other day was born into difficult circumstances			1
she was the daughter of a single woman			0
she was a teenage mother herself			0
she managed to eventually graduate from @entity116 and serve in the @entity112			0
it is just unfortunate that she has n't learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters			2
" @entity123 , bar the door			0
@entity59 's comments were rude , presumptuous and highly inappropriate			1
there are plenty of ways to disagree with a political opponent and make a point without getting personal and dredging up details of her personal life -- and in this case , her mother 's personal life			1
@entity59 as much as suggested that @entity73 should be more sympathetic to unborn babies because , given her life 's circumstance , her mother might have had an abortion and @entity73 would n't be here			1
during an appearance on @entity145 's " @entity146 , " @entity73 was asked to respond			2
here 's what she said : " well , what went through my mind was that that was a terribly personal thing to say			1
and , of course , i 've been in the political arena for some time			0
it takes a lot to offend me			0
but what i was offended about was the statement that it makes on behalf of women throughout the state of @entity3			1
i think it showed disregard for the fact that we all , we each , own our own personal history			0
we make choices and -- and have the opportunity to take chances that present themselves to us			0
what this is about is making sure that women across the state of @entity3 have the same opportunity to make those choices and have the same chances that i had			1
" @entity73 got it right			0
in the abortion debate , women have long insisted that they have the right to control their bodies			1
now do they have to take the next step and assert control over their life stories ? it looks like , in @entity3 , the answer is yes			1
women do need to reassert control over their life stories			1
otherwise , others -- including elected officials -- will try to take over those narratives to serve their own purposes			0
that 's what @entity59 did to @entity73 , and it reflected badly on him			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity196 : the latest dust - up in @entity3 is about women 's reproductive rights
@entity196 : you can disagree with a political opponent without getting personal
he says @entity59 's comments about @entity52 were condescending and rude
@entity196 : now women have to assert control over their own life stories
