@entity0 -- the latest assessment of human rights by the @entity4 is critical of the records of @entity7 governments , including those of allies like @entity10 and @entity11 , and adds that it will take " years " before the impact of the wave of unrest across the region is understood			1
in a gripping introduction to its 2010 @entity18 released friday , the @entity16 said , " because we are publishing this report three months into the new year ... our perspectives on many issues are now framed by the dramatic changes sweeping across countries in the @entity7 in 2011			1
" " at this moment , " it said , " we can not predict the outcome of these changes , and we will not know the lasting impacts for years to come			1
" the detailed report chronicles human rights conditions in 194 countries but it focuses significant attention on events in the @entity7 and @entity32			1
no " sweeping analysis " of the entire region is possible , it said , because the internal dynamics of each country are different			1
but , singling out @entity38 , which sparked the so - called " @entity39 " and @entity40 , which threw out one of the most powerful leaders in the region , the report says , " we are witnessing popular demands for meaningful political participation , fundamental freedoms , and greater economic opportunity			1
" " these demands are profound , they are homegrown , and they are being driven by new activists , many of them young people			2
these citizens seek to build sustainable democracies in their countries with governments that respect the universal human rights of their own people			1
if they succeed , the @entity7 region , and with it the whole world , will be improved			1
" the 2010 @entity18 lists three trends that are affecting rights around the world : the first is the " explosive growth " of non-governmental advocacy organizations promoting democracy and human rights issues and causes			1
" in many countries " citizens ' organizations have been created against great odds and only because individual human rights activists were willing to face great personal risk , " it says			2
in the last several years , more than 90 governments have sought to pass restrictive laws and regulations hampering the ability of organizations to register , operate freely , or receive foreign funding the second trend is the explosion of connective technologies like the internet and mobile phones			0
in @entity40 and @entity38 , the report notes , " while it is the courage of the people themselves that led the way and was the driving force , the amplifying impact of these new technologies , coupled with the power of television stations and the internet to broadcast videos obtained by citizens using these mobile phones , can not be denied			1
" more than 40 governments , however , it says , now are using a combination of regulatory restrictions , technical controls on access to the internet , and technologies designed to repress speech and infringe on the personal privacy of those who use these rapidly evolving technologies			0
in @entity108 , for example , it says bloggers and webmasters have been arrested and charged with " subverting state power " for re-tweeting a post or operating a website where others posted comments			0
the third trend , a negative one , the @entity16 said , is the escalation of violence , persecution , and official and societal discrimination against members of vulnerable groups , such as racial , religious , and ethnic minorities			1
the discrimination extends to women , children , persons with disabilities ; and lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( @entity134 ) persons			0

@entity143 saw an upsurge in killings of members of the @entity134 community by unknown individuals			0
@entity149 in @entity149 , currently in a state of civil war as its leader , @entity152 , clings to power , the @entity16 said , " @entity154 and his close associates monopolized every aspect of decision - making in the government			1
" read about alleged @entity149 rape victim thankful for support			0
the @entity149 government , it says , continues to use torture and arbitrary arrest			0
" a large but unknown number of persons remained in detention or prison for engaging in peaceful political activity or for belonging to an illegal political organization			0
" @entity171 in @entity171 , swept with dissent against its president , @entity175 , government security forces in 2010 committed " unlawful killings , detained political and human rights activists , and tortured and physically abused prisoners and detainees with impunity , " the @entity16 said			1
@entity38 in an update on @entity38 , however , the report is optimistic , saying the @entity4 is " encouraged by the creation of a fact - finding committee to investigate human rights abuses that took place during the uprising , " it said			2
@entity40 in @entity40 , the @entity16 says the @entity4 is " waiting for the government to lift the state of emergency , which the @entity191 has promised to do prior to parliamentary elections			1
" @entity10 a key @entity4 ally , @entity10 , comes in for criticism , with the report noting " there were severe restrictions on religious freedom and discrimination on the basis of religion was common			2
" in addition , the @entity10 government , it said , restricted access to the internet and interfered with citizens ' privacy while online , monitoring e-mail and internet chat rooms and blocked sites , " including pages about @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , and certain forms of @entity217 deemed incompatible with @entity219 law and national regulations			0
" @entity11 in @entity11 , the report cites were " multiple allegations of mistreatment and torture , especially of @entity226 activists associated with rejectionist and opposition groups			2
authorities arbitrarily arrested activists , journalists , and other citizens and detained some individuals incommunicado , " it said			0
@entity226 are underrepresented in leadership positions in the civil service , police , and security forces and citizens in general " did not have the right to change their government			0
" the government restricted civil liberties , including freedoms of speech , press , assembly , association , and some religious practices , it notes			2
@entity252 in @entity252 , the @entity16 cites " institutional , legal , and societal discrimination against @entity255 citizens , @entity257 residents of the @entity258 and the @entity259 , @entity260 , and other religious groups			1
" it says there is societal discrimination against persons with disabilities , as well as discrimination and domestic violence against women , particularly in @entity270 society			0
" while trafficking in persons for the purpose of prostitution decreased in recent years , trafficking for the purpose of labor remained a serious problem , as did abuse of foreign workers and societal discrimination and incitement against asylum seekers			0
" @entity283 in @entity283 , the report cites " arbitrary and unlawful killings , politically motivated disappearances , and reports of torture and other physical abuse accompanied the use of excessive force against civilians in internal conflict			2
human rights abuses included " severe limitations on citizens ' ability to change their government due to , among other factors , corruption , fraudulent voter registration , administrative weakness , and close political - military relationships at high levels			0
@entity305 in @entity305 it cites media and non-governmental organization reports on allegations of extrajudicial killings and detention of civilians by the security forces			0
the total number of reported torture and rape cases of individuals in custody almost doubled , the report notes , compared to 2009			1
@entity108 last year , the state of human rights in @entity108 was a hot - button issue , with charges that secretary of state @entity324 was downplaying abuses			0
the 2010 report says a " negative trend in key areas of human rights continued			1
" the government , it said , " stepped up restrictions on lawyers , activists , bloggers , and journalists ; tightened controls on civil society ; and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and control the press , the internet , and internet access in 2010			2
" it notes the increased use of " forced disappearances , " strict house arrest , arbitrary detention in " black jails " and other forms of " soft detention " to silence independent voices and punish activists and their families			2
it singles out legal activist @entity354 , along with his wife and child			0
@entity354 remained under house arrest , as did other released political prisoners			0
@entity358 in @entity358 , the report says , the government detained demonstrators and continued to pressure non-governmental organizations , independent media , some religious minorities , independent labor unions , and political opposition			2
attacks on and the murder of journalists and activists continued			0
@entity371 and in @entity371 , the @entity16 report highlights " particularly harsh treatment " of pro-democracy activists and journalists			1
more than 700 pro-democracy activists , including seven presidential candidates , were arrested during public demonstrations following the flawed december 2010 presidential elections , it says			2
in the weeks that followed , the offices and homes of civil society representatives , independent journalists , and political activists were raided as part of an effort to stifle expression			0
