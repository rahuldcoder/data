if the @entity1 had been sent to @entity2 in ancient times , it might have found itself sinking in a stream			1
the 2,000 - pound super-rover , which made its now - legendary landing on @entity2 on august 6 , has come across stones in conglomerate rock suggesting that water must have flowed there in the past			1
one such rock outcrop is called @entity13 , after @entity14 in @entity16 's @entity15			0
it looks like someone took a jackhammer and lifted up a sidewalk , said @entity21 , lead scientist for the @entity1 mission , at a press conference thursday			0
the consensus is that " this is a rock that was formed in the presence of water , " @entity21 said			2
" we can characterize that water as being a vigorous flow			1
" in and around this bedrock , @entity1 has come across rounded gravels			1
the rocks appear to have been subjected to a sediment transport process , carried by either water or wind , said scientist @entity37 of the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			1
the gravels seem too large to have been transported by wind , meaning it 's likely that this is a stream bed			1
a second rock outcrop , called link , holds similar evidence			0
scientists used data from @entity1 and the orbiters at @entity2 to enhance their understanding of the area			1
the water flowing in these rock formations was probably somewhere between ankle and hip deep , said @entity1 science co-investigator @entity56 of the @entity57			2
what we 've done on @entity2 , and what 's next scientists believe the water and sediment flowed down the crater into an alluvial fan -- a geological formation created by material that water transports			1
at least intermittently , this fan appears to have extended down to the area where the rover landed			1
it 's hard to say how long ago this water flowed -- an estimate would be " thousands to millions of years , " @entity56 said			1
previously , scientists have used data from past @entity2 missions to speculate about channels on the planet , and whether water could have flowed in them			1
this is the first direct observation of streambed material , @entity56 said			0
there are no plate tectonics on @entity2 , meaning the planet does not have moving plates underneath the surface that cause quakes			1
so why does this @entity13 rock formation look the way it does ? @entity21 hypothesizes that " somewhere near this outcrop , a small impact occurred and lifted the beds up and rotated them , " he said			0
read more about space and science on @entity99 's @entity98 the rover did not employ any of its chemistry tools to examine the area ; rather , scientists made their judgments about the rocks based on photos			2
curiosity is now three - quarters of the way between @entity13 and @entity109 , its next official stop			2
@entity109 was chosen as a target because it has three types of terrain , including layered bedrock , making it a potentially interesting place for @entity1 to try out its drill			2
an unsolved mystery is whether life could have been supported on @entity2			1
water is a necessary ingredient , but an energy source and carbon are also essential			0
curiosity can detect organic molecules and tear them apart to deliver details about them back to @entity129 , but they would still not be definitive evidence that life existed			2
such molecules can come from nonliving sources , and @entity1 does n't have the technology to make that distinction			0
that will have to wait for another mission			0
this rover 's ultimate destination is @entity140 , a 3 - mile - high mountain with layers of sediment that will provide more opportunities to search for organic molecules			2
curiosity recently tested out its contact instruments on a rock called @entity149			0
it used its @entity152 ( @entity152 ) instrument to touch the rock , and the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) to take close - up photos			0
another instrument , @entity157 , shot laser pulses at the rock and finished its testing on monday			0
the $ 2.6 billion mission is slated to last for two years , but previous rovers have far outlasted their estimated lifetimes			0
the spirit rover operated from 2004 to 2010 , and the opportunity rover has been chugging along since 2004			0
these twin rovers had initial mission periods of only 90 days			0

the @entity2 rover curiosity finds stones suggesting past water flow
in bedrock are rounded gravels too large to have been moved by wind
scientists believe water and sediment flowed down the crater of an alluvial fan
the mystery is whether @entity2 could have supported life remains unsolved
