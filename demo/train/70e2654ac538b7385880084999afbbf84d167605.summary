-- shelling hit areas near two key cities in eastern @entity3 on sunday morning , intensifying fears that a ceasefire that took effect less than two days ago may be falling apart			1
why is the ceasefire under strain ? a variety of fighting factions in the conflict zone -- on both sides -- may not fall directly under a military chain of command			1
the @entity15 rebels are mostly volunteer militias ; fighting against them on the @entity3 side are at least some far - right nationalist militias			1
controlling these groups is difficult and some may have different aims , including sabotaging the truce			0
at this point it 's been nearly impossible to figure out who 's doing the firing and why			1
the conditions of the ceasefire agreement do n't help either			2
the conditions are vague and at this point there does n't seem to be an effective mechanism in place inside the conflict zone to monitor and enforce the agreement			0
why ca n't the two sides ' leaders control their forces ? it 's unclear if @entity40 has control over all of the fighting forces in eastern @entity3			1
some of the volunteer militias fighting alongside @entity3 soldiers are far - right nationalists who 've been critical of the current government in @entity40 , but they 're still fighting because they feel @entity3 is under attack by @entity48			1
and who controls the @entity15 rebels ? is it the local commanders ? is it @entity48 president @entity53 ? none of that is clear			0
which side has the most to gain from the truce ? if the truce leads to good - faith negotiations and a compromise , then both sides can gain			2
a compromise could look like something like this : the @entity15 region of @entity66 gets autonomy and self - determination under a federalized @entity3 government , and in return the rebels drop their demand for independence and @entity40 gets to protect @entity3 's sovereignty and territorial integrity			1
there are elements on both sides that do n't want a compromise , and they could certainly have the potential of undermining the truce			1
what happens next ? we wait to see if the overnight shellings and firings are an anomaly or if they 're a sign of more violence and more fighting			0
if the ceasefire sticks , both sides have agreed to hold talks that will address the core issues and demands on both sides that are still unresolved -- including the disarming of the rebels , a guarantee of self - determination for the @entity100 , the fate of @entity48 - annexed @entity102 , constitutional reform , and a solution to the humanitarian crisis in the conflict zone			2
obviously if the fighting continues , all bets are off			0
what effect does this have on the rest of the world ? what happens in the coming days will determine the next move by @entity116 and @entity117 leaders			0
if the ceasefire falls apart , the @entity118 will likely turn up the pressure by following through with sanctions and bolstering @entity117 forces in @entity116 's baltic - member states			2
@entity124 has already threatened to respond if that happens			0
the bottom line is , the conflict will escalate and so will the prospects of a regional conflict -- although at this point that seems unlikely .			0

@entity134 : it 's been nearly impossible to say who 's doing firing and why
