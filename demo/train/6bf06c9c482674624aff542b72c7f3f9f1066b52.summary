-- most people limit their gambling to @entity4 pools or the occasional trip to @entity6			2
celebrities , of course , tend to do everything on a grander scale			2
let 's take a look at some famous people and the high - profile bets on which they cashed in or lost big			1
@entity15 defeats @entity16 , @entity17 everyone remembers the " @entity21 " headline from the 1948 presidential election , but @entity15 was n't the only big winner that night			1
legendary gambler @entity17 had bet $ 10,000 on @entity15 at steep 17:1 odds			1
his logic ? his research showed that female voters were n't too keen on candidates with facial hair , which did n't bode well for the mustachioed @entity16			2
@entity30 has a nice 2001 @entity31 golfer @entity30 had a hot hand during 2001			2
fans might remember that two longshots won titles that year : the @entity36 won the @entity37 , and the @entity38 knocked off the @entity39 in a classic @entity40			1
@entity30 was part of betting groups that had picked both squads			2
their $ 20,000 bet on the 28 - to - 1 @entity36 yielded a cool $ 560,000 , and they hit again with $ 20k on the 38 - to - 1 @entity38			1
and to think people used to say @entity30 could n't get a big win			2
getting into the @entity49 is tougher than free throws last july , @entity52 star @entity51 and a member of his entourage had a fiery debate about whether or not @entity51 could just drop by the @entity49 unannounced and be welcomed with open arms			1
after much back - and - forth , @entity51 decided he 'd give it a try			0
if he could n't get past the gate , he would do 1,000 pushups			0
if he made it inside , his buddy would have to do the pushups			0
unfortunately for @entity51 , even the @entity51 needs an appointment to see the president			0
when @entity51 walked up to the gate , the @entity66 politely but firmly turned him away			0
he later told the @entity69 's @entity68 that he was working off his debt in increments of 20 to 30 pushups			1
@entity0 : great photos found in presidential libraries 4			0
@entity76 's population bomb does n't go off even celebrity scientists have tried their hands at high profile gambling			1
@entity80 biologist @entity76 is famous for his grim predictions concerning overpopulation ; he famously predicted in 1968 that 20 percent of the world 's population would starve to death before 1985			1
as you might expect , these claims were somewhat controversial			0
when @entity76 commented in 1980 that he would make an even money bet that @entity90 would not exist in the year 2000 , economist @entity88 had heard enough			1
@entity88 decided to book an unusual bet of his own with @entity76			0
since @entity76 's underlying @entity94 argument involved the depletion of natural resources , @entity88 made this challenge : @entity76 could name whatever natural resource he wanted , buy $ 1,000 worth of it , and pick a time frame			1
if at the end of the time frame the commodities were worth more than the initial $ 1,000 , @entity88 would pay @entity76 the difference			1
if they were worth less than $ 1,000 , @entity76 would fork the difference over to @entity88			0
if @entity76 's predictions about dwindling natural resources came to pass , the prices of commodities would skyrocket and @entity88 would be out a lot of cash			1
he spread his $ 1,000 evenly among chrome , copper , nickel , tin , and tungsten and told @entity88 to wait 10 years			0
although the world 's population shot up by 800 million people in the intervening decade , the metals ' prices crashed			2
when the bet ended in 1990 , @entity76 had to cut @entity88 a check for $ 576.07			0
@entity126 says do n't bet on a @entity128 reunion by 1974 , legions of fans were clamoring for a @entity128 reunion , but @entity132 was having none of it			1
the drummer told @entity137 reporters that he had bet a thousand pounds that the @entity128 would n't play together that year , and that he would be happy to throw a thousand quid down on the group never playing together again			1
@entity0 : 9 things you might not know about the @entity128 6			1
@entity141 bets on romance when golfing legend @entity141 met his wife , @entity143 , he had a problem that a lot of young guys run into : he could n't afford an engagement ring			1
he was still an amateur golfer at the time , and he was barely scraping by on his meager income			0
eventually , he borrowed money from a group of pals to cover the rock			2
@entity141 was n't crazy about having this sort of debt , so when the same group of buddies proposed a trip to @entity159 's @entity158 , he jumped on the chance to chisel away at his obligations			1
when they hit the links , @entity141 offered the boys this bet : he would get $ 100 for every stroke he finished under 70			1
if he played poorly on the notoriously tough course , he would shell out $ 100 for every stroke he finished over 80			0
although he bogeyed the first hole , @entity141 repeatedly used this system along with a variety of side bets to wriggle out from under $ 5,000 in debt in a single weekend			1
@entity175 ads add up in 1999 , @entity183 ' " @entity182 " was locked in a duel with @entity178 's " @entity177 " for the @entity179 , which set the stage for an unusual bet			2
@entity183 honcho @entity184 bet actor @entity185 that his rival @entity178 would run more ads hyping its film than @entity183 would			0
the stakes : a $ 10,000 donation to the charity of the winner 's choice			2
@entity185 won the wager when @entity183 took out 165 pages of ads versus @entity178 's 118 , and @entity184 paid up			1
@entity0 : where 10 @entity198 winners keep their statues 8			0
computers are no match for chess master in 1968 , @entity204 chess champion @entity203 attended a conference on artificial intelligence and discussed the future prospects for chess - playing computers			0
although @entity203 was optimistic about the future of chess - playing computers , he thought developing great @entity212 would take a while			0
after some debate , he bet four professors 1,250 @entity216 pounds that nobody would make a computer that could beat him within the next 10 years			0
although it took a while for chess programs to pose a serious threat to him , @entity203 ended up winning the bet when he defeated the program @entity224 in a six - game match at the 1978 deadline			0
the man - vs. - machine showdown was such a big deal that even @entity229 covered it			0
after his win , @entity203 put up another $ 1,000 as a bounty for the first chess program that could beat him in a four - or six - game match			2
he eventually fell in 1989 to @entity235 , a precursor to famed chess computer @entity237			0
