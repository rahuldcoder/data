editor 's note : @entity2 founded @entity3 , a site featuring multicultural political commentary , hosts a nationally syndicated @entity6 - language radio show ; and wrote a guide to success for immigrants ( " @entity10 ! " published by @entity11 )			1
he is co-founder and president of @entity13 , an advocacy marketing agency based in @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity2 says immigration reform ca n't wait for next year			1
@entity14 , @entity15 ( @entity17 ) -- one of the greatest challenges for minorities in any democracy is that their priorities often differ with those of the majority			2
consequently , even if a minority group does not experience outright tyranny , it can suffer tragic neglect			1
that 's the lingering problem with immigration reform			1
latino leaders have long called for comprehensive immigration reform			1
during the presidential campaign , it finally seemed destined for reality as candidates sought the crucial latino vote			1
but today , where 's immigration reform on the list of priorities ? apparently , it 's plummeting faster than bank stocks were during the market 's freefall			1
maybe the president hoped we would n't notice			2
he mentioned it in passing while we were engrossed in the health care drama			2
and instead of telling us directly , in a meeting with the @entity53 leaders that supported his candidacy , he announced it while chatting with foreign heads of state			0
what did he say ? no immigration reform until 2010			1
but since he 's expending massive political capital on health care , and 2010 is a midterm election year renowned for inaction on controversial matters , the postponement is as menacing as the promise is dubious			1
" experience and history have told us if it 's postponed to the following year , then you 're talking about 2011 , " rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , told the @entity70			2
but with health care and financial reforms , budget deficits , and tax hikes looming , what hurdles will we face by 2011 ? what realistic hopes remain for immigration reform ? rep. @entity82 , @entity69 , said if a comprehensive bill is n't passed , " we 'll try to do it piecemeal			1
" " @entity88 " is a favorite course for a @entity86 that finds bipartisan compromise unpalatable			0
but given the issue 's persistent magnitude , such a response is tantamount to a negligent -- perhaps tyrannical -- master tossing a crumb from the table to a pack of ravenous , emaciated dogs			0
instead , why do n't we step up as a nation and face the challenge with a level of honor and attention that is consistent with the best of our ideals ? after all , the @entity104 raised its torch to welcome immigrants , not to light the way for the insurance executives and @entity110 bankers prioritized by policymakers today			0
i grew up on the border and i can honestly say , it pains me to watch us squander billions on a border fence when we 've yet to see a man - made structure that can stop the forces of nature			0
what we call " immigration " -- in the case of @entity122 -- is actually a pattern of migration , a natural movement of homo sapiens dying of thirst and hunger , seeking water and nourishment in more fertile grounds			2
@entity133 immigration reform should thus be viewed as an essential measure to protect human rights on our soil and continent			1
this is a time to think big , not small			0
this is about more than laws and lines drawn on a map			0
it is about the origins of our humanity , not our nationality			0
real people are suffering as raids continue , border deaths and hate crimes escalate , and families are destroyed			0
" without a solution , the problems will only worsen , " i was told by @entity156 , executive director of @entity158 , a non-profit serving immigrants in @entity161 , @entity162 , for 27 years			0
" @entity133 reform will save lives , keep families together and give immigrants the opportunity to contribute fully to @entity169 's economy and security			2
it 's a humanitarian issue , but it 'll also benefit @entity169 to do it right			0
" on an issue prioritized by the nation 's largest , fastest - growing minority group , why not do it right ? why wait any longer ? even sen. @entity180 , @entity181 , in rare agreement with his @entity178 counterparts , said he was disappointed by the delay			0
he said he is " ready to work " with the president on the issue			2
with our nation divided on many fronts , why ca n't we capitalize on bipartisan support for immigration reform now ? rather than blame competing priorities for procrastinating , why ca n't @entity191 wow us with a display of multitasking brilliance ? at least immigration reform does n't come with a price tag of a trillion dollars and a host of new taxes as health care reform does			1
that should make it popular by comparison			0
" reform is a priority in the @entity53 community , " @entity204 president @entity203 told the @entity70			1
" i would strongly urge that @entity53 organizations push the issue that we need comprehensive immigration reform now			1
" latino leaders should settle for nothing less			0
latino voters should exhort all elected officials to act with the same urgency they would exhibit were it their own kin dying on the vine			0
@entity219 once said : " all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent			0
" in that spirit , we should unite to make this not only a @entity53 priority , but an @entity169 priority			0
and all people of good conscience should speak up for what 's right -- or risk creeping towards tyranny by neglect			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : during campaign , candidates promised action on immigration
he says president @entity241 said action will be delayed till next year
he says that delaying reform amounts to tragic neglect of human needs
@entity2 : can immigration be resolved in a *congressional* election year ?
