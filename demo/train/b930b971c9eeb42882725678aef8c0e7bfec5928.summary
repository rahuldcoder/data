@entity1 -- " they deserve a vote			2
" president @entity4 made that impassioned argument toward the end of his @entity8 message on tuesday , using a strong emotional appeal to hammer home his plea for a vote in @entity13 on several gun control measures			1
he drew on the spirit of @entity16 , the @entity18 teenager who was shot dead just a week after performing during the president 's inaugural weekend celebration			1
her parents were sitting next to first lady @entity23 in the @entity25 gallery			0
" they deserve a vote , " @entity4 called out again			1
he called on the image of former rep. @entity28 , who was wounded by a gunman two years ago in @entity30			0
" @entity28 deserves a vote , " he said			2
but in using passion to push @entity13 toward action , did the president go too far ? and will it work ? it might			2
@entity38 sen. @entity37 , a leading @entity39 and tough @entity4 critic , told @entity0 's @entity40 that he would not block a vote on gun control in the @entity43			1
" no , let 's vote , " @entity37 said			1
" i do n't disagree with the president to have a debate			1
let 's find something we can agree on			2
" @entity53 @entity52 sen. @entity51 , a gun enthusiast , also said he would not get in the way of a vote			1
" i wo n't block a vote on anything , whether i support it or not , " he said			1
whether @entity4 's plea is taken as an effective tactic that will help spur legislative action or is seen as a cheap , emotional ploy designed to push through a one - sided agenda depends on where you fall in the debate , political experts say			1
what @entity4 said tuesday night " that 's the way to do it			1
if you do n't do that it 's not going to happen , " said @entity70 , dean and professor at the @entity72 at @entity74 's @entity73			1
" you bring the families in , you bring in @entity28 and it makes the case this needs to do be done , " @entity70 said			2
in perhaps the most passionate part of his speech , @entity4 was also sending a message to voters , who polls have shown are divided over changes in gun law			1
" @entity89 of these proposals deserves a vote in @entity13			1
if you want to vote no , that 's your choice			2
but these proposals deserve a vote , " @entity4 said			1
" because in the two months since @entity98 , more than a thousand birthdays , graduations , and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun , " he said			0
@entity4 pressed on as people stood and applauded and some wiped away tears			2
one woman clutched a photo of a shooting victim			0
@entity37 to @entity4 : stop ' cheerleading ' for gun laws gun control advocates are hoping to capitalize on that emotion			1
@entity112 , a grassroots organization for mothers , plans on delivering a @entity115 petition with more than 150,000 signatures aimed at urging the @entity117 and members of @entity13 to " to stop blocking commonsense gun regulations			0
" " @entity98 was a wakeup call for many moms across the nation			0
... moms are so upset by the current state of our gun policy and continue to be upset , " said @entity123 , executive director and co-founder of the group			0
the nation 's gun lobby and other gun rights advocates said they will work hard to ensure that legislation is considered without the type of emotion on display during the @entity8 address			1
" what i want from my legislative policy makers is a serious adult discussion , emotions are very strong and it 's not what you want to make decisions on			0
we did that after 9/11 and we ended up with the @entity157 , " said @entity149 , who served as regional political director for the @entity117 during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group , the @entity156			1
@entity117 president @entity158 was similarly put off by the president 's approach			2
complete coverage of the gun debate " the one thing that sort of upsets me a little bit is the president is trying to use emotion to force things through before they are rationally debated , argued and examined and that 's a mistake because that 's the way you get to bad policy , " @entity158 told @entity0 following the president 's speech			1
" there are going to be votes on some of these things			0
some of these things may have more support than others and some of them may drop along the way as we head to the final days of this confrontation on second amendment rights , " he said			0
gun rights advocates are also using emotional appeals to make their point			1
these are perils we are sure to face - not just maybe			0
it 's not paranoia to buy a gun			2
it 's survival , " the @entity117 's executive vice president @entity194 wrote in an op - ed published wednesday by the conservative news website , @entity196			2
" it 's responsible behavior , " he continued			0
" and it 's time we encourage law - abiding @entity202 to do just that			0
" @entity13 is preparing to consider such measures as a ban on the manufacture of new high - powered assault weapons , cracking down on straw purchases of guns for those who ca n't pass background checks , curbing gun trafficking and expanding background checks			2
house speaker @entity215 has said he has no plans to bring any measure up for a vote until the @entity43 acts first			2
@entity39 oppose any assault weapons ban and rural - state @entity52 facing tough re-election fights are unlikely to support it as well , meaning that proposal has little chance of passing @entity13			0
there is some bipartisan support for expanded background checks , especially to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness			0
a number of lawmakers may also support limiting the size of ammunition magazines			0
the top @entity236 in @entity13 , senate majority leader @entity237 of @entity238 , has a good rating from gun rights groups and has said he would work to ensure that a variety of proposals are brought to the floor for consideration			1
gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking to that end , the emotional nature of the president 's address could help @entity52 who are in a difficult position on @entity4 's push for @entity13 to at least vote on tougher gun laws			1
the call places pressure on congressional democrats , particularly in the @entity25 who may find that support of tougher gun laws could make it hard for them in the 2014 mid-term election			0
but bucking the party could anger the @entity52 base			0
" i think that the emotional appeal in the @entity8 speech can be important for elected officials who have to appeal to a jurisdiction that is not overwhelmingly @entity39 , " said @entity267 , director of @entity268			0
" i have some confidence that there will be support in the @entity43 , including from several @entity52 in states with large populations who are gun owners , for passing universal background checks , funding to encourage better reporting to the @entity282 ( @entity282 ) mental health disqualifications , and measures to strengthen laws that can be used to prosecute and deter illegal gun trafficking , " @entity267 said			0
however getting such legislation past the @entity25 is another matter			0
" i am less optimistic about these things in the @entity25 because the @entity39 has so few moderates , most are in safe gerrymandered districts , and the @entity117 provides critical funding and grassroots resources , " @entity267 said			0
" but i suspect that the party will take a hit politically if they have a deaf ear to the country 's cry for much needed reforms			0
" gun violence plans : what 's in the works @entity0 's @entity40 contributed to this report			1

some embrace president @entity4 's appeal for gun control vote ; others turned off
two *key* senators say they wo n't block effort to bring proposals to a vote
gun control advocates aware emotionally charged *environment* works for them ; gun rights groups see differently
lawmakers in tough districts must consider both emotion and logic when casting votes
