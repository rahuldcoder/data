on monday , a @entity1 official said that @entity3 rebels had likely used the nerve agent sarin			1
@entity5 , the veteran war crimes prosecutor and a commissioner of the @entity7 for @entity3 , made this claim on a @entity11 - @entity10 tv station			2
@entity12 explained , " our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims , doctors and field hospitals and , according to their report of last week which i have seen , there are strong , concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas , from the way the victims were treated			0
" @entity12 added , " this was used on the part of the opposition , the rebels , not by the government authorities			0
" the @entity1 commission later pedaled back from @entity12 's statement , saying that it " has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in @entity3 by any parties to the conflict			1
" the context here , of course , is that president @entity42 is under pressure to act in @entity3 because of his tough statement in august that the use of chemical or biological weapons in the @entity3 conflict would cross a " red line			1
" in the past few weeks , there have been multiple reports that @entity52 's regime has deployed chemical weapons			1
( and after @entity12 's remarks were reported , a @entity55 official told @entity57 that the @entity58 does not have information suggesting that rebels have " either the capability or the intent to deploy or use such weapons			1
" but , the source said , the " facts are not complete " and efforts to obtain more information are ongoing			0
) but @entity12 's statement that the opposition is likely using chemical weapons raises an important issue : how plausible is the use of such weapons by any of the many armed factions that are fighting @entity52 's regime ? the most effective @entity3 opposition group is widely considered to be @entity75			1
the @entity55 says that @entity75 is simply a cover name for @entity77 in @entity78 , which has long operated in @entity78 and neighboring @entity3			1
it is a worrisome fact that @entity77 in @entity78 is the only @entity77 franchise ever to have actually used chemical weapons			1
@entity77 in @entity78 detonated a series of crude chlorine bombs in @entity78 from late 2006 through mid- 2007			2
a study by the @entity84 found a total of 16 chlorine gas bombings in @entity78 , the last of which was in june 2007			0
on october 21 , 2006 , @entity77 in @entity78 launched this campaign of chlorine bomb attacks by detonating a car loaded with mortars and chlorine tanks in @entity93 , wounding three @entity78 police officers and a civilian			0
such attacks sickened many hundreds of @entity78 , but the victims who died in these assaults did so from the blast of the bombs rather than from inhaling chlorine			0
@entity58 and @entity78 troops successfully killed or captured many of the people in @entity77 in @entity78 who were building the chlorine - laced bombs and captured much of the group 's stockpiled chlorine			1
@entity108 , who headed the @entity110 's operations against @entity77 in @entity78 's chlorine bomb network , told me in 2010 : " there was a lot of effort to secure the chlorine , to get a hold of the tanks , to track these guys down ( who were responsible for building the chlorine bombs ) , to kill them or capture them			0
meanwhile , the attacks are not being particularly successful			0
the people are dying in the blast , but fortunately nobody is dying from chlorine			0
" there is no evidence that @entity77 in @entity78 stopped its campaign of chlorine bombing because of any qualms about the use of such weapons			2
chlorine gas was used by both sides during @entity135 but was banned by the @entity136 , along with the use of other poison gases , after the end of the war			0
the use of such weapons has been a matter of some debate within the leadership of @entity77			2
in documents found by the @entity146 who raided @entity149 's compound two years ago in @entity150 , @entity151 , there was a letter written by @entity149 five days before he was killed in which he urged his followers in @entity154 who were considering using " poison " to be " careful of doing it without enough study of all aspects , including political and media reaction			0
" as we consider the conflicting reports of the use of chemical weapons that have emerged from @entity3 over the past weeks , it is worth recalling that the @entity77 affiliate in @entity3 has in the past used crude chemical weapons on multiple occasions in neighboring @entity78			1
also @entity77 's leaders such as @entity149 have pushed back on the use of such weapons only insofar as their use might damage the image of @entity77 in the eyes of the @entity175 public , not because of international norms that the use of these weapons is beyond the pale .			2

official on @entity1 commission says @entity3 rebel group may have used nerve agent
@entity184 : it would not be first time @entity77 - affiliated group used chemical weapons
@entity42 administration raises *doubts* that rebels used chemical weapons
@entity195 : issue of who may have used them in @entity3 is key to @entity58 response
