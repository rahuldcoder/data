-- it 's the height of summer in @entity2 , and the director of the most famous art museum in the world is queuing like any other tourist			0
three - and - a - half hours later , @entity7 finally enters the @entity8 , putting his bag through security , asking for directions , stopping to buy snacks and drinks			1
it 's a familiar story for anyone brave enough to join the snaking line during peak season			0
less so , when you 're the man who holds the key to the front door			0
a few months after taking the top job at the @entity8 , 49 - year - old @entity7 went on a covert mission to see what it 's really like for the average @entity26 jostling against the snap - happy masses			1
why ? " if you are a professional , there is a risk at certain times you are only going to look at the museum with the eyes of a professional , " he told @entity0 in his first television interview with the international press , since taking the role in april			0
" the people who visit the @entity8 might only stop by once , and a trip to @entity2 is the holiday of their life			2
we have to make sure that they are received with a certain dignity			0
" the people 's museum ? with over 9.7 million tourists streaming through the turnstiles last year -- easily making it the most popular museum on the planet -- the biggest challenge the institution now faces is not how to increase numbers , but how to improve the experience			2
how will @entity7 , one of the institution 's youngest ever directors , make that happen ? " i hope it will be more welcoming , which means that when you arrive at the museum there are less queues , that the people of foreign origin find reference points in their language , that with the help of @entity68 and apps you understand what you see , " he said			1
" i picture a museum in which everyone finds their space			0
what threatens museums is that it is only an elite which understands the works of art. i want a museum where there are young people , children , elderly people -- and that requires work			0
" @entity86 it 's an ambitious vision for the 220 - year - old gallery , an institution so steeped in prestige that @entity7 underwent an interview with @entity93 president @entity92 before being offered the role			1
but then , @entity7 is n't like previous directors			2
growing up in social housing just outside of @entity2 in the 1960s , his father was a postman , his mother a caretaker of an apartment building			1
a former archeology and art history professor , @entity7 was head of the @entity8 's @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity107 department before taking over from 12 - year director @entity108 -- himself the son of a business lawyer			1
described by colleagues as a " quiet intellectual with a penchant for tweed and sweater vests , " @entity7 says the first time he visited the gallery as an 11 - year - old on a school trip , it revolutionized his view of the world			1
" i was a kid that lived in a modern city , almost entirely dating from the 1960s , " he said			0
" and there i was , in the heart of @entity2 , shown works of art that were more than 5,000 years old and that history is profound			0
" beyond the stars yet gaze across at the crowds scrambling to get a photo of the @entity134 -- while a room of precious @entity137 paintings stands almost empty -- and you get the feeling not everyone shares @entity7 's appreciation for the @entity8 's vast collection			1
" the majority of people want to see the works of art that are the most famous -- the @entity134 , the @entity147 , and the @entity148 , " said @entity7			2
" we have to do some profound work to valorize the other collections			0
" how ? through exhibitions of lesser - known works , new educational centers , and translating information plaques into @entity156			0
@entity8 of the @entity8 's 460,000 works , just 35,000 are exhibited , the rest in storage deep under the famous building			2
that 's where @entity162 comes in -- a € 150 million ( $ 200 million ) sister gallery in a former mining town in northern @entity93			1
opened last year , the gleaming new building displays around 200 pieces on loan from @entity2			0
it 's part of a growing @entity8 empire , with another gallery set to open in @entity172 in 2015 , exhibiting 300 works from @entity93 museums			1
the @entity175 is paying € 400 million ( $ 538 million ) for the prestigious @entity8 name			2
and in times of austerity , it 's a deal which will help the @entity93 institution revamp its entrance and ticket areas			1
does the deal also devalue the @entity8 brand ? " no , " says @entity7			1
" it 's an agreement , a scientific partnership , an economic partnership			0
" with @entity7 at the helm , it 's also the beginning of a brave new era for the beloved institution .			2
