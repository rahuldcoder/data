-- after months of speculation surrounding the " @entity4 " reboot , " @entity5 , " it seems like the pieces are finally starting to come together			1
early last week , @entity0 broke the news that 11 - year - old @entity8 was cast to play the series ' girl , @entity11			1
since then , producers have also filled the spot of @entity11 's best friend , @entity15 ( @entity14 ) , and announced the addition of two more roles ( including one , @entity18 , who sounds a whole lot like " @entity4 's " resident geek @entity20 )			1
so , who else can we expect to see on @entity5 ? and what will @entity24 and @entity4 be like now that they 're all grown up ? @entity0 spoke to " @entity4 " creator @entity26 , who is exec producing the " @entity5 " pilot for @entity28 , to get the scoop on what fans of the coming - of - age classic should expect			1
on why " @entity5 " almost did n't happen : when execs at @entity28 first approached @entity26 with the idea of revisiting @entity4 , he promptly nixed the idea			1
" there 's a natural reticence to want to try and attempt something that you 've been really lucky enough to do once , " explains @entity26			1
but after mulling it over , @entity26 decided that he wanted to create a show for the " new generation of kids that live in a much more difficult world			2
" the only catch ? @entity26 was dead set against doing a sequel , which he felt would amount to nothing more than a reunion show			2
" a reunion show that 's one and done , " says @entity26 , who instead suggested centering the pilot on @entity24 and @entity4 's daughter , @entity11			1
" but to actually take the children of @entity24 and @entity4 and watch on two levels [ as they ] grow up and as @entity24 and @entity4 keep growing up , i ca n't resist that			2
i ca n't resist that and i 'm very hopeful the audience wo n't resist it either			0
" on his vision for @entity5 : like its predecessor , @entity26 says he hopes the pilot for " @entity5 " captures " the confusions about growing up and what we are supposed to be and what we are supposed to aspire to be			1
" as for @entity26 ' own aspirations for the show , he says , " there 's a column that i want to play in and that column contains @entity76 and @entity77			1
that was always the column that i wanted @entity4 to be included in and i want @entity5 to be in that column as well			2
" ' @entity81 ' : ' today ' mini-reunion on @entity24 and @entity4 as parents : they may have two kids , but do n't expect @entity24 and @entity4 to have it all figured out			0
" @entity4 has always been much more certain that @entity24			0
@entity24 has always been confused			0
that would never stop , " says @entity26 , who explains that the long - time sweethearts will have differing points of views on parenting			2
" now he 's a father			0
@entity24 does n't know how to be a father			0
" @entity24 will also be grappling with his decision to become a teacher			0
" he 's following in the footsteps of [ mr. @entity96 ] , the most influential character in his life , " says @entity26			1
" should he be ? will he succeed ? can he influence children like @entity96 influenced children ? what is @entity4 's observation of that ? how does she help ? and what is @entity4 's life ? and what has she become ? you 'll remember we left the series and they were in @entity110 and they were going on an adventure to go to @entity112			0
did they succeed ? did it work ? all of that will be answered in the pilot			0
" on @entity11 's personality : will the youngest @entity11 be more like her dad or her mom ? @entity26 wo n't say , though he will reveal that " she is going to be much more like one than the other but that second parent will pop up in ridiculously unexpected times and places and add to the confusion of who this character is			1
" as for who she 's is n't ? @entity26 says that @entity11 will not aspire to be an actress , singer , or dancer as many fans have speculated			1
" that was never @entity4 and it 's the farthest thing that this show will be			0
" @entity138 chews the fat with @entity140 on whether or not other @entity4 cast - members will make an appearance : while @entity26 says many of the supporting characters , including @entity11 's brother and her rebellious best friend , will be reminiscent of old favorites like @entity149 , @entity150 , and @entity20 , he also adds that the door is " wide open " for those originals to make an appearance on the series if the pilot gets picked up			1
" i think there 's more than a chance , " says @entity26 , who explains that he 's spoken to many of the former cast members and that they 've all expressed interest in being apart of the project in some capacity			2
" i think there 's a strong chance , " he says			0
on reuniting with @entity165 and @entity166 : though @entity26 has stayed in touch with both @entity165 and @entity168 , he says reuniting with them for @entity5 has been " the greatest possible thing that can happen			1
" @entity26 , who refers to the actors as his surrogate children , is hoping fans will feel the same			2
" [ hanging out with them ] is gratifying and rewarding and what i 'm hopeful for is that there will be a vast audience who wants to hangout with them again as well			0
