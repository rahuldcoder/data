-- one of two 12 - year - old @entity3 girls accused of stabbing a third girl repeatedly after reading online horror stories is not competent to stand trial , a doctor reported to the court handling the case			1
but the court - ordered report on @entity12 's competency -- mentioned in a hearing in @entity14 on wednesday -- is n't the final word on the matter , as judge @entity17 granted the prosecution a chance to challenge the finding in an august 1 hearing			1
also wednesday , @entity17 granted the prosecution 's request for doctors to examine @entity12 again , this time to determine whether she has a " mental disease or defect " that could have an impact on the case			2
prosecutor @entity29 requested the new examination , noting that the competency report does n't address whether @entity12 is mentally ill. further details about the report are n't publicly available , as the court has sealed it			1
@entity12 and @entity36 are charged as adults with attempted first - degree intentional homicide , accused of stabbing a 12 - year - old schoolmate in a @entity14 park 19 times and leaving her to crawl to her own rescue in late may			1
after being hospitalized for days , the victim is recuperating at home , her family has said			1
both defendants were silent , handcuffed and wearing blue jail clothes , as they attended separate procedural hearings wednesday morning			0
neither defendant has entered a plea , as lawyers for both sides have tried to deal with @entity12 's competency and procedural matters ahead of an official preliminary hearing			0
both are being held with bail set at $ 500,000			0
@entity36 's attorneys have n't asked the court to determine whether she is competent , but her lawyer @entity60 told @entity17 on wednesday that he reserved the right to do so			0
@entity36 's defense team has said it will try to move her case to juvenile court , and @entity60 said @entity36 's competency could come up as part of that attempt			0
like @entity12 , @entity36 is next due in court august 1 , when @entity36 's attorneys are expected to tell @entity17 how much more time they need to prepare for a plea hearing			0
@entity17 ordered that the new report on @entity12 's mental health be completed before her august 1 hearing			0
