energy drinks can pose a real problem for children , according to a new study from the @entity4			1
researchers found that 40 % of the 5,156 calls to poison centers for " energy drink exposure " involved children under age 6			1
in most of the cases , the parents did n't know the children had gotten hold of an energy drink			1
many of the calls reported the children were experiencing serious side effects , such as an abnormal heart rhythm , or they were having a seizure			2
the study is being presented at the @entity4 's @entity23 this week			0
study : caffeine affects teen boys more study author dr. @entity27 has handled cases involving children who became sick after consuming energy drinks			1
while studies about the impact of caffeine on children are limited , @entity27 , a professor and chairman of pediatrics at @entity33 , said adolescents can experience serious problems after drinking only 100 mg of caffeine			2
younger children would feel effects after drinking even less , he said			0
some energy drinks contain more than 300 mg of caffeine and it can come in a combination of pharmaceutical - grade caffeine and " natural " additives			1
earlier studies have shown caffeine combinations may cause more problems for people			0
@entity27 said he believes the number of cases associated with energy drinks and children are higher than what 's reported in this study			1
that 's because parents of children who get sick after consuming too much caffeine do not always call the hot line ; they may go straight to the emergency room instead			2
the study did not look at those numbers			0
" the reported data probably represent the tip of the iceberg , " @entity27 said			0
" this is a very concerning finding , " said dr. @entity66			0
@entity66 is the medical director of the preventive cardiology clinic at @entity69 in @entity70			0
" it further points out that we need to be very responsible about who utilizes energy drinks , because they are potentially harmful to adults , but as this report points out , may be of greater concern to those who are young			0
" the @entity80 does not set a standard for what is considered a safe amount of caffeine for children			1
the @entity86 prefers children consume no caffeine , although about 73 % of children do every day , according to their research			1
children and adolescents are the fastest growing population of caffeine users , studies show			2
can you od on caffeine ? for healthy adults , the @entity80 suggests moderate amounts of caffeine are not harmful			1
the agency considers a " moderate amount " between 100 to 200 mg ( one to two 5 - ounce cups of coffee )			0
other @entity80 guidance has cited 400 mg a day , or about four or five cups of coffee , " as an amount not generally associated with dangerous , negative effects			2
" more than 600 mg a day is considered too much , according to the @entity80 , although the impact caffeine has on someone varies based on their size , their gender , or how sensitive they are to caffeine			2
the study 's researchers would like the government to improve the labeling of energy drinks			2
energy drink makers are not required to list the amount of caffeine in a drink , because caffeine is not a nutrient , and the laws currently only require nutrients be listed in the dietary information on food or beverages			1
the @entity130 recommends that energy drink makers identify the quantity of caffeine from all sources			1
the association suggests listing this in a part of the label that is separate from the nutrition information			0
the association also suggests including the advisory " not ( intended / recommended ) for children , pregnant or nursing women ( and / or persons / those ) sensitive to caffeine			0
" @entity145 , for instance , added the caffeine content and warning to its labels in 2013			0
but because this is not required by law , not all energy drink labels contain such warnings			1
in 2010 the @entity80 banned combination alcohol - and - energy drinks and calls to poison control centers for this particular combination fell sharply			1
caffeine 101 " we should consider appropriate labeling in light of this finding to help protect those who are consciously drinking the energy drinks , but also to protect those who may be drinking them unaware , " @entity66 said			0
" we need to consider these energy drinks and their potential effects on the heart and vasculature and recognize that they are not benign			0

40 % of " energy drink exposure " calls to poison control centers are for children under 6
study authors believe the number is under - counted
the @entity80 does not set a caffeine limit for children
