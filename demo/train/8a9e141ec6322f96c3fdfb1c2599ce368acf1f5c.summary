@entity0 , @entity1 -- we all have things that we ca n't stand but must routinely put up with			1
here are a few of mine : slow elevators , outrageous bank fees and being asked the question , " where are you from ? " everybody hates the first two , but why am i so opposed to the last one ? for starters , i know the impatient looks that will follow when i answer with where i live ( @entity0 ) or where i grew up ( @entity15 ) , or where i was born ( @entity16 )			1
that last one , by the way , really seems to throw people for a loop			0
( my parents were graduate students in @entity22 when i landed on this earth			0
) what often follows next is that the person asking me the question either congratulates me on speaking @entity27 well or , confused by my answers , looks at me like i do n't understand @entity27			1
the next question , though , is always the same : but where are you really from ? of course i know what they mean , and the people who ask me this ( almost ) never have any real malice in mind			0
they 're not saying i could n't possibly be @entity37			1
rather , something about me -- perhaps my name or the color of my skin -- has lit their curiosity			0
still , i 've always resented the question because it implies that i can only really and authentically be one thing , the one thing , incidentally , that i had no choice in choosing and have no power to change			0
i do n't want to be misunderstood			2
like millions of other @entity37 , i , too , have a hyphenated identity			1
left of the hyphen , i 'm @entity50 , and a very proud one to boot			1
but that 's not all i am			2
i 'm also a writer , a professor , a @entity53 , a @entity55 speaker , a passionate ( but terrible ) singer , a lousy swimmer , a @entity1 , an @entity58 , the youngest of three children , a drinker of way too much coffee , a lover of @entity65 ' poetry , a hater of injustice , a husband , a frequent flyer , and , according to my wife , a person in some serious denial that he 's getting older			1
the question " where are you from ? " may help others locate me , but it will never describe me			2
it used to be the case that after i told people about my origins , i would invariably hear a wish to visit the pyramids or be asked my thoughts regarding certain @entity84 novels			0
yet lately , the reaction has changed			0
now , after telling people i 'm @entity50 , i can almost see the news headlines and maps of the @entity89 overlapping in their mind , and i 'm usually confronted with a statement like this : " oh			1
) hey , i have nothing against @entity53			0
" that 's precisely what a man i met in an @entity98 restaurant recently told me			2
it was his pause that , well , gave me pause			0
today , identity is too easily turned into a rallying cry for purity and violence			1
think of the lunatics of @entity108 , like @entity109 , who recently called on @entity37 @entity53 to attack their own country			1
@entity108 will never accept that @entity53 ( or @entity37 ) can be more than what @entity108 determines them to be			1
likewise , the @entity113 chorus led by people like @entity116 politician @entity115 , who calls @entity117 a " retarded culture , " want to pigeonhole us into diametrically opposing identities that necessarily have to careen into conflict with each other			0
i know it because i live the many facets of my identity every day without succumbing to my own internal civil war			2
millions of other @entity37 do , too			1
a few years ago , i heard a useful way of thinking about identity			2
i was in @entity130 , addressing a group of @entity133 university students , and with me was @entity134 , the eminent @entity135 scholar of the @entity136			0
@entity134 began his talk about identity with a metaphor , asking the audience to imagine they were invited to a big international pot luck dinner			2
all the guests have brought their national foods to share			0
at that moment , our differences are the only things that matter , since from the differences in taste comes flavor			0
but if a fire were suddenly to consume that same house , trapping a baby in the flames , no sane person would hesitate to save that baby , regardless of its origin			0
in our choices for survival , our similarities simply must outweigh our differences			0
@entity134 's metaphor strikes me as a particularly powerful way of thinking about the @entity37			1
yes , there are people around today trying to start that fire , but i 'm confident they are a few in an increasingly complex nation of over 300 million people , each of us with multiple identities			2
it 's up to us to douse the flames of hatred and intolerance before they start , keeping the party that is the @entity37 going			1

@entity177 : like many @entity37 , i have a hyphenated identity
he says he 's of @entity50 descent but that does n't fully describe him
@entity177 was born in @entity16 , raised in @entity15 and now lives in @entity1
he says , " today , identity is too easily turned into a rallying cry for purity and violence . "
