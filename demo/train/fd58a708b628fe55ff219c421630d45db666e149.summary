@entity0 -- five weeks before the november midterm elections , voters give @entity4 an edge over @entity6 , according to a @entity1 / @entity8 poll released tuesday			2
but the poll also indicates most of @entity4 ' gains are coming from the @entity11 and not from the parts of the country where they 're locked in tight contests that could give @entity6 control of the @entity17			0
in a generic ballot among likely voters , @entity4 edged out republicans 47 - 45 % , a 6 - point swing from a @entity1 poll three weeks ago when likely voters favored the @entity6 by a 4 - point margin			1
the @entity4 ' advantage is within the poll 's 3.5 % margin of error			0
the " generic ballot " question which asks @entity29 to choose between an unnamed @entity30 and an unnamed @entity6 in their vote for @entity33 , suggests a shift toward the @entity4 nationally , if not in key races in key states			1
the poll comes a week after the @entity29 launched airstrikes against @entity41 in @entity42 , and while poll respondents overwhelmingly think the economy is the more important issue , they gave @entity46 low marks for how it handled the @entity41 threat and have more faith in president @entity50 than @entity6 leaders to set the military policy to deal with the militant @entity54 group			1
" that may explain why the @entity4 have gained strength on the national " generic ballot " question , " @entity1 polling director @entity55 said			1
@entity4 gained the most ground among men and independent voters , two key groups that could help @entity4 in competitive races this november			0
men took a 7 - point swing toward democrats from the previous poll , bringing the party within 6 points of @entity6 ' 49 % support			0
" that may be a sign that some men wanted to see aggressive action taken against @entity41 and are rewarding the president 's party -- or simply that the president 's actions have convinced men that they do n't need to send more republicans to @entity0 in order to get action that they are looking for , " @entity55 said			0
republicans also lost support among independents as @entity4 saw a 7 - point bump , giving them a 44 - 42 % advantage over rivals			2
and while the traction for @entity4 comes in the wake of an expanded military campaign ordered by @entity50 , roughly two out of three @entity29 said the economy is more important than military action against @entity41 in determining who they 'll vote for in the midterms			1
those numbers reveal a different mindset than in the lead up to the @entity99 , when 49 % said in september 2002 the possibility of war with @entity102 was a more important factor than the economy			0
that may be because most @entity29 , 59 % , do n't consider the conflict with @entity41 to be a war , according to a @entity1 / @entity8 poll released monday			2
@entity29 remain unsatisfied with @entity46 's handling of the situation with @entity41 : 60 % of @entity29 said they disapprove , just weeks after members of @entity46 absconded from @entity112 without a vote on military action against @entity41 to campaign for reelection in their districts			1
but maybe that 's not such a bad mark for @entity46 , given that 83 % said in the @entity1 / @entity8 poll three weeks ago that they disapproved of how @entity46 was handling its job overall .			0

@entity4 edged out republicans 47 % to 45 % in generic ballot
60 % of @entity29 disapprove of how @entity46 handled the war with @entity41
the economy is more important than military action against @entity41 among voters by a 2 - 1 margin
