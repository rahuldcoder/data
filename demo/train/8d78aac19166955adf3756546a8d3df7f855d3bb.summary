-- in just over three weeks , @entity1 has won his first two @entity3 titles and got married			1
as the new leader of the @entity7 series , the @entity4 has catapulted himself into the top - 15 of the world rankings and is considered a real contender to win his first major at next month 's @entity11			1
but what he really wants is a spot in @entity16 's @entity15 squad come september as the @entity4 team seeks to avenge the 2010 defeat by @entity19			1
" i hope it gets @entity16 's attention			0
i think i will be no. 1 in the points , so i hope that gets his attention , " @entity1 told reporters after sinking a final - hole birdie to avoid a playoff at the @entity25 on sunday			2
" obviously being a @entity15 year , that would be special to have on your resume and play in , even if it 's only for one time			1
that was one of my main goals			0
the @entity7 , being no. 1 is a great position to be in , but we 're maybe a little more than halfway through , so we have a long haul on that			1
" having been winless for 163 @entity3 starts , @entity1 finally broke his duck in @entity44 at the end of last month when he beat three - time major winner @entity46 in a playoff to claim the $ 1.15 million first prize at the @entity49			1
the 35 - year - old then wed his partner @entity51 , had his honeymoon at last week 's @entity53 in @entity54 and took home another $ 1.17 million in @entity56 on sunday as he denied fellow @entity58 resident @entity57 the chance to claim his second title 18 years after his first -- which would have been a record gap			1
" all these things that come with winning are great but i do n't think much about ' em , other than the @entity15 and trying to win tournaments , " @entity1 said			1
" you probably could n't dream it any better than what 's been going on here			0
the wedding has been in the works for close to a year so -- i guess i proposed in july -- but to win two events and get married in the span of 22 days , it 's pretty remarkable			1
" @entity51 and i are lucky to be in the position we 're in and to have each other and enjoy what 's going on around us right now			0
" last year @entity1 was twice denied his maiden victory in playoffs , the latter coming in the @entity77 as @entity78 claimed his first major , but he insists he never lost faith that the breakthrough would come			2
" people do n't realize how fine the line is between winning			0
sometimes that can be a hard pill to swallow , but when i 've been on the other side of it , i always took encouragement from it , that i was playing great golf , and my time was going to come , " he said			0
" i think it really just propelled me this offseason			0
i played some events overseas where i played well , and i was thinking coming into the beginning of this year that i could play some really good golf			2
it 's time to win some events out here			2
" i feel comfortable on the golf course when i 'm out there			0
i feel like i 'm in good control of my game , getting better emotionally with dealing with the pressures of trying to win out here			0
" meanwhile , former @entity4 @entity15 player @entity104 has no chance of qualifying for this year 's match in @entity107 after being ruled out for up to five months with arm injuries			1
@entity104 missed the 2010 defeat in @entity110 after having thumb surgery , and now he faces another long rehabilitation after damaging his right elbow when he hit a rock at the @entity115 as well as suffering from tendinitis in his left forearm			2
" i 'm obviously disappointed because i 've been fighting to get my game back on the right track and having an injury hold me back is frustrating , " the three - time winner said in a statement on the @entity3 website			2
" i 've been through this process before , though , and know that you have to put in your work with treatments to get healthy			0
that will be my focus for the next four or five months so i 'm in a position to return healthy towards the end of the year and be fully ready for 2013			0
