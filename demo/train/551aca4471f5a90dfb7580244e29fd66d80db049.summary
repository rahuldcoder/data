-- @entity1 can do miraculous things these days ( thank you underwire )			0
but can they detect cancer ? that 's the claim for @entity8 new bra , equipped with a series of sensors embedded in the cups that pick up temperature changes in breast tissue and , says the @entity15 , @entity16 - based company , provide a thermal fingerprint that can alert doctors to the presence of malignant cells			1
according to the company 's website , the data generated by the sports bra can predict the presence of breast cancer with 90 % specificity and sensitivity			1
women wear it for 12 hours to accumulate a stable enough reading of temperature , and the measurements are fed into the company 's algorithm that then spits out a result : normal , benign , suspected for breast tissue abnormalities , or probable for breast tissue abnormalities			1
sounds like a good idea , right ? except that the concept of using temperature to detect disease may not be ready for prime time just yet			1
" hypothetically , it 's conceivable that malignant processes would have a temperature gradient compared to non-malignant tissues , " says dr. @entity45 , medical director of the cancer prevention center at the @entity48 @entity47			1
" but that gradient may not be very large			0
" ( more : a @entity56 € ” high - tech athletic gear ) the idea of using thermograms to ferret out abnormally growing cells is already being used with an imaging device that takes a temperature reading of breast tissue			1
tumors need nutrients to grow , and they start to siphon these off from their own blood supply , which they start to build as they amass more and more abnormally growing cells			2
all of this metabolic work generates heat , and it 's this temperature change that thermograms â € ” and the @entity8 bra 's sensors â € ” are designed to pick up			1
but when these profiles , which show " hot " and " cold " spots that are supposed to correlate to cancerous and non-malignant tissue , respectively , are compared to mammogram , @entity80 and ultrasound tests , their findings do n't always match up			2
" we see some thermograms come back as abnormal , and we do all kinds of imaging with mammogram , ultrasound and @entity80 and we follow the women and nothing develops , " says @entity45			0
" and we have women with breast cancers that are not seen on the thermograms			0
it 's not perfect , and needs to undergo much more rigorous testing to understand what role temperature readings can play in cancer screening			2
" even if the readings provide a positive result , and if , as the company says , the tumors are at their earliest stages and barely detectable as a mass , it 's not clear what doctors can do for women at that point			0
surgery is n't an option until tumors reach a certain size that can be identified and removed , and radiation and chemotherapy are too toxic to start before cancers reach a certain threshold to justify the side effects			0
what do doctors do with a positive test ? for now , they would likely have women come in for more frequent mammograms , @entity80 or ultrasound testing , to evaluate whether their abnormally growing cells morph into tumors or not			2
if that 's the case , most women will probably have had their tumors detected by one of these methods anyway , even if they had n't used the bra			2
already , the latest data raise questions about the efficacy of mammograms in women in their 40s ; the @entity137 recently recommended that women wait until they are 50 to start yearly screenings , because studies showed that the costs of screening women in their 40s , including additional testing and complications caused by these supplemental procedures , did not save more lives			0
so while the idea of wearing a sports bra for 12 hours to detect breast cancer certainly sounds appealing , the bra may be a bit ahead of itself			1
it 's not clear yet whether predicting , and ideally treating breast cancer with the bra can reduce deaths from the disease , or help women avoid more advanced and aggressive cancers			1
" we really need to have more solid data before we start adding on tests , especially when we have tests [ like the mammogram , @entity80 and ultrasound ] , " says @entity45			0
those tests are n't perfect either , but they do have a track record of helping to save lives			0

new bra has sensors that pick up temperature changes in breast tissue
its maker , @entity8 , says it can alert doctors to cancer cells
doctors say the *system* is n't ready to be *fully* trusted yet
